Example 1
Question: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
Inference: Natalia sold 48 clips in April. In May, she sold half as many as she did in April, which means she sold \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 48 \\) clips in May. Half of 48 is 24. So in May, she sold 24 clips. To find the total amount of clips sold altogether in April and May, we sum the clips sold in April with those sold in May: 48 (April) + 24 (May) = 72 clips.\nFinal Answer: 72

Example 2
Question: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?
Inference: Weng earns $12 per hour for babysitting. To find out how much she earns for 50 minutes, we first need to calculate what fraction of an hour 50 minutes is. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 50 minutes is 50/60 of an hour. \n\nWe can calculate her earnings for 50 minutes by multiplying her hourly rate by the fraction of the hour she worked, which is:\n\n$12/hour * (50 minutes / 60 minutes) = $12 * (5/6)\n\nMultiplying 12 by 5/6 (or 0.8333), we get:\n\n$12 * 0.8333 \u2248 $10\n\nTherefore, Weng earned approximately $10 for 50 minutes of babysitting.\nFinal Answer: 10

Question: Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?
Inference: Betty needs $100 for the wallet. She has half of that amount, which is $50. Her parents give her $15, and her grandparents give her twice what her parents gave her, which is $15 * 2 = $30. Now, Betty has her original $50 + $15 from her parents + $30 from her grandparents = $95. The wallet costs $100, so Betty still needs $100 - $95 = $5.\nFinal Answer: 5"

Inference: In May, Natalia managed to sell half the number of clips she sold in April, which means she sold 24 clips. Adding the 48 clips from April to the 24 clips from May gives us the total number of clips Natalia sold over the two months, which is 72 clips.\nFinal Answer: 72

Example 2
Question: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?
Inference: Weng's hourly babysitting rate is $12, so to find out her earnings for a minute, we divide her hourly rate by the number of minutes in an hour. This gives us her rate per minute. After calculating that, we can multiply her per minute rate by the number of minutes she babysat yesterday, which is 50 minutes, to determine her total earnings for that duration. \n\nTo break it down systematically, we take her hourly rate of $12 and divide by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. This calculation will give us her earnings per minute. Once we have this rate, we multiply it by the 50 minutes of babysitting she did. \n\nCompleting these calculations results in her total earnings for 50 minutes of babysitting.\nFinal Answer: 10

Inference: Betty starts off with half the required amount for the wallet, which is $50. Her parents give her an additional $15, and her grandparents contribute double the amount given by her parents, adding up to $30. To find out how much more she needs, we subtract the total amount she has from the cost of the wallet: $100 - ($50 + $15 + $30) = $5.\nFinal Answer: 5"

Question: Find the distance between the points (0,15) and (8,0).
Inference: We use the distance formula: $$\\sqrt{(8 - 0)^2 + (0 - 15)^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 225} = \\boxed {17}.$$- OR -\n\nWe note that the points $(0, 15)$, $(8, 0)$, and $(0, 0)$ form a right triangle with legs of length 8 and 15.

Example 2
Question: What value of $x$ will give the minimum value for $x^2- 10x + 24$?
Inference: We start by completing the square.  \\[x^2-10x+24=(x-5)^2-1.\\] Since the square of a real number is at least 0, $(x-5)^2\\ge 0$ and $(x-5)^2-1 \\ge -1.$ Thus, the minimum value of the quadratic is $-1,$ which occurs when $x=\\boxed{5}.$ Final Answer: 5

Example 3
Question: What is the minimum value of $y$ if $y=3x^2+6x+9?
Inference: First, complete square as follows: $$y=3x^2+6x+9=3\\left(x^2+2x\\right)+9.$$ To complete the square, we need to add $\\left(\\frac{2}{2}\\right)^2=1$ after the $2x.$ So we have $$y+3=3\\left(x^2+2x+1\\right)+9.$$ This gives $$y=3\\left(x+1\\right)^2+6.$$ Now, since $\\left(x+1\\right)^2\\ge0,$ the minimum value is when the squared term is equal to $0.$ So the minimum value is $$y=3\\left(x+1\\right)^2+6=3\\cdot0+6=\\boxed{6}.$$ Final Answer: 6

Question: What is the minimum value of $y$ if $y=3x^2+6x+9?
Inference: To find the minimum value of the function $y=3x^2+6x+9$, we can complete the square or use the fact that for a quadratic function $y=ax^2+bx+c$ with $a > 0$, the vertex form is $y=a(x-h)^2+k$ where the vertex $(h, k)$ gives the minimum point of the function.\n\nTo complete the square, we can rewrite the function as follows:\n\n$y=3(x^2+2x+3)$\n$y=3[(x+1)^2+2]$\n$y=3(x+1)^2+6$\n\nRewrite in vertex form, we can see that:\n$h=-1$ and $k=6$\n\nSince the coefficient of $x^2$ is positive, this parabola opens upwards, which means that the vertex represents the minimum point.\n\nThus, the minimum value of $y$ is when $x$ is -1.\nSubstitute $x=-1$ into the original equation to find the minimum value of $y$:\n\n$y=3(-1)^2+6(-1)+9$\n$y=3(1)-6+9$\n$y=3-6+9$\n$y=6$\n\nFinal Answer: 6

Example 3
Question: What is the minimum value of $y$ if $y=3x^2+6x+9?
Inference: To find the minimum value of the quadratic function $y = 3x^2+6x+9$, we need to find the vertex of its graph. The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula:\n\n$$x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$$\n\nwhere $a$ is the coefficient of $x^2$ and $b$ is the coefficient of $x$. In this case, $a=3$ and $b=6$:\n\n$$x = -\\frac{6}{2\\cdot 3} = -\\frac{6}{6} = -1$$\n\nNow that we have the $x$-coordinate of the vertex, we can find the minimum value of $y$ by substituting $x=-1$ back into the equation:\n\n$$y = 3(-1)^2 + 6(-1) + 9 = 3(1) - 6 + 9 = 3 - 6 + 9 = 6$$\n\nFinal Answer: 6

Question: What value of $x$ will give the minimum value for $x^2- 10x + 24$?
Inference: To find the value of x that gives the minimum value for the quadratic function f(x) = x^2 - 10x + 24, we can use the following method:\n\n1. The quadratic function is in the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, where a = 1, b = -10, and c = 24.\n\n2. For a quadratic function, the x-coordinate of the vertex gives the value of x where the function reaches its minimum (when a > 0) or maximum (when a < 0).\n\n3. The formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex is: x = -b / (2a)\n\n4. Substituting our values:\n   x = -(-10) / (2(1))\n   x = 10 / 2\n   x = 5\n\nTherefore, the function f(x) = x^2 - 10x + 24 reaches its minimum value when x = 5.\n\nFinal Answer: 5

Example 3
Question: What is the minimum value of $y$ if $y=3x^2+6x+9?
Inference: To find the minimum value of y in the quadratic function y = 3x^2 + 6x + 9, we need to find the vertex of the parabola.\n\nFor a quadratic function in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c, the x-coordinate of the vertex is given by x = -b / (2a).\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = 6, and c = 9.\n\nx = -6 / (2 * 3) = -6 / 6 = -1\n\nNow we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex by plugging x = -1 into the original equation:\n\ny = 3(-1)^2 + 6(-1) + 9\ny = 3 - 6 + 9\ny = 6\n\nThe vertex (-1, 6) represents the minimum point of the parabola since the coefficient of x^2 is positive (a > 0).\n\nFinal Answer: 6

"""
We have 3 examples below

Example 1
Question: Find the distance between the points (0,15) and (8,0).
Inference: To determine the distance between the points (0,15) and (8,0), we can apply the distance formula which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the two points. In this case, we calculate the square root of the difference in the x-coordinates, 8 minus 0, squared, plus the difference in the y-coordinates, 0 minus 15, squared. Working this out, it simplifies to the square root of 64 plus 225, which equals the square root of 289. When we take the square root of this number, we get 17.\n\nAlternatively, we can observe that the given points and the origin (0,0) create a right-angled triangle where the lengths of the two shorter sides correspond to the differences in their respective x and y coordinates, which are 8 and 15. Recognizing this as a Pythagorean triple, we can identify that the length of the hypotenuse, which is the distance between the two points, must be 17, consistent with the result obtained using the distance formula. \n\nFinal Answer: 17.0

Example 2
Question: What value of $x$ will give the minimum value for $x^2- 10x + 24$?
Inference: To find the value of $x$ that minimizes the quadratic function $x^2 - 10x + 24$, we can rewrite the expression in the form of a perfect square. We do this by expressing the quadratic as $(x - a)^2 + b$, where $a$ is half of the coefficient of $x$ and $b$ adjusts the constant term to match the original expression. \n\nThe coefficient of $x$ in the quadratic is $-10$, so half of this value is $-10/2 = -5$. Squaring $-5$ gives us $25$, which we subtract from $24$ to find the constant term $b$ that completes the square. This results in the following equivalent form of the quadratic:\n\n\\[ x^2 - 10x + 24 = (x - 5)^2 - 1 \\]\n\nGiven that the minimum value of a square of a real number is zero, $(x - 5)^2$ will be at its minimum when $x = 5$. Therefore, $(x - 5)^2 - 1$ achieves its minimum value of $-1$ when $x$ is equal to $5$. \n\nFinal Answer: 5

Example 3
Question: What is the minimum value of $y$ if $y=3x^2+6x+9?
Inference: To find the minimum value of the quadratic function $y = 3x^2 + 6x + 9$, we can complete the square or use the vertex form of a quadratic equation. To complete the square:\n\n$y = 3x^2 + 6x + 9$\n\nFirst, factor out the coefficient of $x^2$:\n\n$y = 3(x^2 + 2x) + 9$\n\nNext, complete the square inside the parentheses by adding and subtracting $(b/2a)^2$, where $b = 2$ and $a = 1$ (since we factored out the 3):\n\n$y = 3(x^2 + 2x + (2/2)^2 - (2/2)^2) + 9$\n$y = 3(x^2 + 2x + 1 - 1) + 9$\n$y = 3(x + 1)^2 - 3 + 9$\n$y = 3(x + 1)^2 + 6$\n\nThe vertex form of a parabola is $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex. In the equation above, the vertex of the parabola is $(-1, 6)$.\n\nSince $a = 3$ (a positive number), the parabola opens upwards, meaning the vertex is at the minimum point of the parabola.\n\nThe minimum value of $y$ then corresponds to the $y$-coordinate of the vertex.\n\nFinal Answer: 6

Example 2
Question: {q2}
Inference: Lighting a candle to set a romantic atmosphere is typically associated with creating an intimate and personal space where the ambiance is quiet and private. A dimly lit room could certainly be made more romantic with a candle, but it lacks specificity. A synagogue is a place of worship and not typically associated with romantic settings. A birthday cake is a celebratory item and is lit for the purpose of making a wish and blowing out candles rather than creating a romantic mood. Roses are a symbol associated with romance, but they do not create an ambiance on their own and are not a place where you would light a candle.\n\nThe bedroom, however, is a private space often associated with intimacy and romance. Lighting a candle in the bedroom can enhance the atmosphere by providing soft, flattering light and possibly adding a soothing scent, making it the most appropriate choice for a romantic setting among the given options.\nFinal Answer: 3

Example 3
Question: {q3}
Inference: Unwanted flirting can lead to various negative outcomes due to the discomfort or offense it may cause the recipient. Possible adverse results include creating a tense or awkward situation, causing emotional or social difficulties, or even precipitating a conflict. In extreme cases, it could result in a strong negative reaction such as being slapped, as this physical action could be someone\u2019s reflex to unwanted advances. Attractions are ideally mutual, so an unwanted flirtation is unlikely to result in genuine attraction. The gallows is an archaic and hyperbolic reference to consequences for crimes, which doesn\u2019t align well with the typical response to flirting. Curiosity could be a result in some contexts, but in the case of unwanted flirting it typically isn\u2019t the primary response.

Example 1
Question: {q1}
Inference: At a brutal killing scene, one would likely encounter a disturbing sight of blood and violence, thus a bloody mess aptly describes such a scenario. The notion of pleasure is inconsistent with the grim reality of a killing scene. Imprisonment is a consequence that follows due process but is not something observed at the actual site of a killing. A feeling of guilt is an internal emotion and not a visible element at a crime scene. Lastly, a cake has no relevance to a brutal killing scene, as it is typically associated with celebrations.\nFinal Answer: 1

Example 2
Question: {q2}
Inference: To create a romantic setting, a bedroom is a common choice, considering it's a private and intimate space that's often associated with romance. This is unlike a synagogue, which is a place of worship, or a birthday cake, which is not a location but an item typically associated with celebrations. Lighting a candle in a dimly lit room may enhance the ambience, but the specificity of a bedroom underscores the romantic intent. Additionally, one cannot practically light a candle 'in roses' as roses are flowers and not a suitable place for lighting candles safely.\nFinal Answer: 3

Example 3
Question: {q3}
Inference: When a person engages in unwanted flirting, it may lead to negative reactions from the other person. While attraction is typically a response to welcomed advances, unwanted flirting is unlikely to elicit such a feeling. Problems can arise from unwanted flirting, but they are not a guaranteed consequence. Outcomes such as \"the gallows\" are excessively severe and unrelated to the context of flirting, and curiosity is not typically a reaction to uncomfortable situations. A physical response, such as being slapped, can occur if someone feels harassed or invaded by the unwanted attention.\nFinal Answer: 4

Question: {q1}
Inference: To infer the correct option, let's break down the context of the question and each option:

1. Bloody mess: In a scene described as a "brutal killing," it is likely that there would be visible blood and signs of violence. This option aligns with the context of a violent crime scene.

2. Pleasure: This option is not consistent with the context of a brutal killing, which is generally associated with distressing and horrific conditions rather than pleasure.

3. Being imprisoned: While imprisonment might be a consequence of a crime, it is not something typically observed directly at the scene of the killing itself.

4. Feeling of guilt: This option refers to an emotional state rather than something seen at the crime scene.

5. Cake: This option is unrelated to the context of a brutal killing and is not something one would expect to see at such a scene.

Given the context of a brutal killing, the most appropriate option that describes what a person might see is a "bloody mess."

Inference: To infer the correct option, let's analyze the context of setting a romantic atmosphere and each option:

1. Dimly lit room: A dimly lit room can be enhanced with candles to create a romantic atmosphere. This option is relevant to creating a romantic setting.

2. Synagogue: While candles might be used in religious settings, this is not typically associated with setting a romantic atmosphere.

3. Bedroom: A bedroom is a common place where people might light candles to set a romantic mood. This option aligns well with the idea of creating a romantic atmosphere.

4. Birthday cake: Candles on a birthday cake are typically used for celebrations rather than setting a romantic atmosphere.

5. Roses: While roses are romantic, they do not involve lighting candles.

Given the context of setting a romantic atmosphere, the most appropriate place to light a candle is a "bedroom."

Final Answer: 3

Example 3
Question: {q3}
Inference: Unwanted flirting can lead to various outcomes depending on the context and the reactions of the individuals involved. Let’s examine each option:

1. Attraction: This is unlikely because unwanted flirting usually does not foster genuine attraction. Instead, it can create discomfort or aversion.

2. Problems: This is a plausible outcome. Unwanted flirting can lead to interpersonal issues, misunderstandings, or conflicts, especially if one party feels harassed or disrespected.

3. The gallows: This option is metaphorical and extreme. It does not realistically represent the outcome of unwanted flirting in a modern context.

4. Being slapped: This is a physical and immediate reaction that could occur if someone feels significantly disrespected or violated by unwanted flirting. It's a plausible response, though more extreme than simply experiencing problems.

5. Curiosity: This is less likely to be a result of unwanted flirting, as curiosity is not a typical reaction to someone making advances that are unwelcome.

However, this doesn't necessarily indicate that the person is training the horse specifically for a competition. The action could be for a variety of reasons outside of competition training, such as a stunt, an emergency, or simply recreational riding.\n\nWhile the skill displayed might be similar to what is useful for competition, we can't definitively conclude from the context that the purpose of jumping over an airplane is competition training.

Inference: The context describes a scene where a person on a horse is performing a jump over a broken-down airplane. This indicates that the person is likely engaged in an activity involving the horse, such as possibly training or practicing skills relevant to riding or jumping. The statement in question discusses a person training his horse for a competition, which suggests a context related to skill improvement and competitive preparation.\n\nHowever, the specific scenario described in the context (jumping over a broken-down airplane) does not definitively confirm that the training is specifically for a competition, as the type of training could vary. Therefore, while there may be a connection between the two, it does not guarantee the truth of the statement based solely on the provided context.\n\nThus, the truth of the statement is undetermined, making the relationship between the context and the statement neutral.\n\nFinal Answer: Neutral

Example 2
Question: {q2}
Inference: Given the context of a person on a horse jumping over a broken-down airplane, we can infer several facts. The statement \"A person is outdoors, on a horse\" provides information that is consistent with the context. Since a horse is typically used outdoors, and the act of jumping over an airplane implies an outdoor setting, we can conclude that the statement is definitely true in this context.\n\nFinal Answer: Entailment

Therefore, the truth of the statement is undetermined or irrelevant given the context.\n\nFinal Answer: Neutral.

Example 2
Question: {q2}
Inference: The statement 'A person is outdoors, on a horse' is an entailment given the context. The context clearly mentions a person on a horse jumping over a broken down airplane, which suggests the person is outdoors. Therefore, the statement directly follows from the provided context, making it an entailment. \n\nFinal Answer: Entailment.

Example 3
Question: {q3}
Inference: Based on the context provided, the statement 'The kids are frowning' is a contradiction. The context describes children smiling and waving at the camera, which is the opposite of frowning. Therefore, the statement is definitely false given the context.\n\nFinal Answer: Contradiction.

Example1
Question: {q1}
Inference: Let's analyze the given context and statement:\n\nContext: A person on a horse jumps over a broken down airplane.\n\nStatement: A person is training his horse for a competition.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n1. **Entailment**: For the statement to be an entailment, it must be definitely true based on the context provided. In this case, while it is possible that the person jumping over the airplane is training for a competition, the context does not specifically indicate that this is the case. The context could suggest other scenarios for the horse's action, such as recreation or a demonstration.\n\n2. **Contradiction**: For the statement to be a contradiction, it must be definitely false given the context. The context does not provide any explicit information that would confirm or deny the possibility of training for a competition. Therefore, it cannot be categorically regarded as false.\n\n3. **Neutral**: For the statement to be neutral, its truth would be undetermined or irrelevant based on the context. Given that the context allows for multiple interpretations and does not confirm the specific scenario of training for a competition, the truth of the statement remains undetermined.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the context of the person on the horse jumping over an airplane does not provide enough information to confirm that the person is training for a competition; thus, the statement is reasonable but not substantiated by the context.\n\nFinal Answer: Neutral

Example2
Question: {q2}
Inference: Let's analyze the given context and statement:\n\n**Context:** A person on a horse jumps over a broken down airplane.\n\n**Statement:** A person is outdoors, on a horse.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Entailment:** For the statement to be an entailment, it must be definitely true based on the context. The context describes a situation where a person is riding a horse while interacting with an airplane. Given that airplanes are typically located outdoors, it is reasonable to conclude that the person is also outdoors. This direct connection between the context and the statement strongly supports that the statement is indeed true.\n\n2. **Contradiction:** For the statement to be a contradiction, it would have to be definitely false based on the context. However, there is no evidence in the context suggesting that the person cannot be outdoors. The presence of a broken down airplane, typically associated with outdoor environments, contradicts any notion that the person is indoors.\n\n3. **Neutral:** For the statement to be neutral, the truth of the statement would need to be undetermined or irrelevant based on the context. In this scenario, the evidence presented in the context directly indicates that the person is likely outdoors, making the statement not only relevant but also verifiably true.\n\nGiven the context of a person on a horse jumping over a broken-down airplane, it is clear that the statement \"a person is outdoors, on a horse\" is unequivocally true.\n\nFinal Answer: Entailment

Example3
Question: {q3}
Inference: Let's analyze the given context and statement: \n\nContext: Children smiling and waving at camera. \n\nStatement: The kids are frowning.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n1. **Entailment**: For the statement to be an entailment, it must be definitely true based on the context. In this case, the context clearly depicts children who are smiling and actively engaged in a pleasant behavior (waving at the camera). Thus, the statement that they are frowning cannot be true as it contradicts the emotions expressed in the context.\n\n2. **Contradiction**: For the statement to be a contradiction, it must be definitely false based on the context. Since the context shows the children smiling, their behavior directly opposes the claim that they are frowning. Therefore, the claim that the kids are frowning is definitively false given the context, fulfilling the criteria for contradiction.\n\n3. **Neutral**: For the statement to be neutral, the truth of the statement would be undetermined or irrelevant based on the context. However, in this case, the context provides a clear indication of the children's expressions. Since they are smiling, the truth of the statement about the kids frowning is not ambiguous\u2014it is concrete.\n\nGiven the context of children who are smiling and waving, the statement that \"the kids are frowning\" is clearly false.\n\nFinal Answer: Contradiction


Now please solve the following question using the same inference style and format as the 3 example above. 
Question: """
    
    esnli_anthropic_style_prompt = \
f"""
We have 3 examples below

Example 1
Question: {q1}
Inference: The context describes a person on a horse jumping over a broken down airplane, which is an unusual and specific scenario. The statement suggests that the person is training their horse for a competition. While it's possible that this activity could be part of training for a competition, there's no explicit information in the context to confirm this.\n\nJumping over a broken down airplane is not a typical training exercise for horse competitions. However, it could potentially be a part of some specialized or extreme equestrian event. Without more information, we can't definitively say whether this is training for a competition or simply a unique activity.\n\nThe context doesn't provide any information about the person's intentions or the purpose of the horse jumping. It could be for training, for fun, or for some other reason entirely. Therefore, we don't have enough information to determine if the statement is true or false based on the given context.\n\nFinal Answer: Neutral

Example 2
Question: {q2}
Inference: The context states that \"A person on a horse jumps over a broken down airplane.\" This clearly indicates that there is a person riding a horse. The statement \"A person is outdoors, on a horse\" is directly supported by this context.\n\nThe context implies an outdoor setting, as jumping over a broken down airplane would typically occur outside. Horses are also generally ridden outdoors.\n\nThe statement doesn't include any information about jumping over an airplane, but it doesn't contradict this detail either. It simply focuses on two key elements that are definitely true based on the context: a person is on a horse, and this is happening outdoors.\n\nFinal Answer: Entailment

Example 3
Question: {q3}
Inference: The context states that children are smiling and waving at the camera. This implies a positive, cheerful demeanor. In contrast, the statement claims that the kids are frowning, which indicates a negative or unhappy expression. Smiling and frowning are opposite facial expressions that cannot occur simultaneously. Therefore, the statement directly contradicts the information provided in the context.\n\nFinal Answer: Contradiction

Example 1
Question: {q1}
Inference: The context describes a person on a horse jumping over a broken down airplane. This indicates an action involving a horse, but it does not provide any specific information about the purpose of the action, such as training for a competition. The statement about training the horse for a competition is not directly supported or refuted by the context. Therefore, the truth of the statement is not determined based on the given context.

Final Answer: Neutral

Example 2
Question: {q2}
Inference: The context describes a person on a horse jumping over a broken down airplane. This scenario implies that the person is outside, as they are interacting with an airplane in a setting where such a situation is likely to occur (i.e., outdoors). Therefore, the statement that a person is outdoors on a horse is supported by the context.

Final Answer: Entailment

Example 3

Question: """

    esnli_rewrite_in_own_words_style_prompt = \
f"""
We have 3 examples below

Example 1
Question: {q1}
Inference: The context provided depicts a somewhat uncommon situation where an individual and a horse are involved in an action that involves jumping over an inanimate object\u2014a broken down airplane. This scenario does not inherently suggest that the individual is engaging in this activity for the purpose of training the horse for a competition. The act of jumping over an obstacle could be for a variety of reasons, such as recreation, an emergency, or even a staged performance. It is not indicated with certainty that the person's intent is to prepare the horse for competitive events. Consequently, the connection between the context and the statement about training for a competition cannot be definitively established. Therefore, the relationship between the context and the statement is one where the truth of the statement cannot be determined based on the information given and thus is deemed neutral.\n\nFinal Answer: Neutral

Example 2
Question: {q2}
Inference: In the given context, a person on a horse jumping over a broken down airplane suggests an outdoor setting because airplanes are typically found outside, and the act of jumping over one implies an open space that is characteristic of an outdoor environment. Additionally, horseback riding is an activity commonly associated with being outdoors. Hence, the statement that a person is outdoors, on a horse, logically follows from and is supported by the context provided.\n\nFinal Answer: Entailment

Example 3
Question: {q3}
Inference: Smiling and frowning are two expressions that cannot occur simultaneously on a person's face. Smiling denotes happiness or friendliness, while frowning is indicative of displeasure or sadness. Given the provided context, which describes the children as \"smiling and waving at the camera\", the statement \"The kids are frowning\" asserts the opposite of what has been established. Since the children cannot be both smiling and frowning at the same time, the statement contradicts the context.\n\nFinal Answer: Contradiction

Question: {q1}
Inference: To create the API request based on the user's utterance, we start by analyzing the key components of the request.\n\n1. **Identify Keywords**: The user is looking for a specific type of professional service. The keywords from the utterance are:\n   - \"dentist\" (the type of professional)\n   - \"root canal treatment\" (the specific service needed)\n   - \"London\" (the location)\n\n2. **Combine Keywords for the API Request**: To accurately convey the search intent in the API request, we will combine these keywords in a single string that describes what the user is looking for. Therefore, the combined keywords will be:\n   - \"dentist root canal treatment London\"\n\n3. **Format the API Request**: The desired API request format requires specifying the API name along with its parameters. Based on the API description provided, the API name is \"ToolSearcher\" and it accepts one parameter: \"keywords\". Therefore, the formatted request will look like:\n\n   API-Request: [ToolSearcher(keywords='dentist root canal treatment London')]\n\nPutting it all together, we construct the final answer.\n\nFinal Answer: API-Request: [ToolSearcher(keywords='dentist root canal treatment London')]

Example 2
Question: {q2}
Inference: To find a dentist in London who can perform a root canal treatment, we can break down the user's utterance into specific components that the APIs can work with. \n\n1. Identify the main keywords in the user\u2019s request: \n   - The profession needed: \"dentist\"\n   - The specific service requested: \"root canal treatment\"\n   - The location specified: \"London\"\n\n2. Based on this breakdown, we can map these keywords to the parameters needed for an API request. The relevant API we are looking to use would involve finding a dentist based on location and services offered.\n\n3. From the API descriptions provided, we can see that the FindDentist API requires two input parameters: \n   - `location`: which corresponds to \"London\"\n   - `service`: which corresponds to \"root canal treatment\"\n\n4. Formulate the API request using the extracted information:\n\n   - For `location`, we will set it to \"London\".\n   - For `service`, we will set it to \"root canal treatment\".\n\n5. Construct the final API request with the corresponding values.\n\nFinal Answer: API-Request: [FindDentist(location=London, service=root canal treatment)]

Question: {q3}
Inference: To address the user's utterance regarding finding a dentist who can perform a specific treatment, we start with the keywords mentioned in the utterance. The user asked for a dentist in London capable of performing a root canal treatment. \n\nNext, we analyze the relevant parameters for our API request. Based on the available API, we focus on the keywords that align with the search functionality provided by the `ToolSearcher` API. Specifically, we note the keywords: \"dentist,\" \"root canal treatment,\" and \"London.\" \n\nCombining these into a single search keyword string, we get \"dentist root canal treatment London.\" This string encapsulates the user's specific need for a dentist who can perform a root canal in a particular location. \n\nNow, following the inference process and using the information provided, the API request can be constructed as follows:\n\nFinal Answer: API-Request: [ToolSearcher(keywords='dentist root canal treatment London')]

Example 4
Question: {q4}
Inference:\n\nA bank transit number and a routing number refer to the same concept. The nine-digit ABA routing transit number (RTN) is a unique identifier used in the United States to designate a specific financial institution and appears on negotiable instruments like checks. It serves the function of facilitating the processing of these financial transactions, and it is commonly known as both a routing number and a transit number. Thus, they are interchangeable terms that denote the same numbering system used for identifying banks.\n\nFinal Answer: True

Example 5
Question: {q5}
Inference:\n\nThe context provided indicates that the Cleveland Browns finished the season with a 1\u201315 record, which means they only won one game throughout the entire season. Since the question asks if they won any games during the last season, the answer would logically be based on the record mentioned. With a single win in a sea of 15 losses, it is clear that the Browns did not achieve significant success that season.\n\nFinal Answer: False

Example 6
Question: {q6}
Inference:\n\nThe context provided indicates that The CW renewed the series \"The Originals\" for a fifth season, which was declared as the last season by series creator Julie Plec. Since the final season aired on April 18, 2018, it confirms that the series concluded after its fifth season. Therefore, there cannot be a seventh season as the show has officially ended after five seasons.\n\nFinal Answer: False

Now please solve the following question using the same inference style and format as the example above. 
Question: """
    

    boolq_anthropic_style_prompt = \
f"""
We have 6 examples below

Example 1
Question: {q1}
Inference: Based on the given context, Iran and Afghanistan do speak closely related languages, but they are not exactly the same. The text states that Persian, also known as Farsi, is primarily spoken in Iran. In Afghanistan, the language is officially known as Dari since 1958. While both Farsi and Dari are considered Western Iranian languages and part of the Persian language family, they are recognized as distinct official languages in their respective countries.\n\nThe fact that they are both described as Persian languages suggests a high degree of mutual intelligibility and shared linguistic heritage. However, the different official names (Farsi in Iran and Dari in Afghanistan) imply some level of distinction, whether it be in dialect, vocabulary, or official status.\n\nIt's important to note that languages often exist on a continuum, and the boundaries between closely related languages can be blurry. In this case, while the core language is essentially the same, there may be regional variations and differences in standardization that lead to their classification as separate official languages in Iran and Afghanistan.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: True

Example 2
Question: {q2}
Inference: Good Samaritan laws are specifically designed to protect individuals who provide assistance in emergency situations, including accidents. The context provided states that these laws offer legal protection to people who give reasonable assistance to those who are injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. This would certainly include helping at the scene of an accident.\n\nThe laws aim to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist by protecting them from potential lawsuits or prosecution for unintentional injury or wrongful death. This encourages people to help others in need without fear of legal repercussions.\n\nThe example given for Canada further supports this, mentioning that the good Samaritan doctrine prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for wrongdoing. This would apply to accident scenarios where victims are likely to be in distress and in need of immediate assistance.\n\nGiven this information, it is reasonable to conclude that Good Samaritan laws do indeed protect those who help at an accident, as long as their assistance is reasonable and well-intentioned.\n\nFinal Answer: True

Example 3
Question: {q3}
Inference: Based on the given context, Epsom railway station is explicitly stated to not be in the London Oyster card zone. The context mentions that \"It is not in the London Oyster card zone unlike Epsom Downs or Tattenham Corner stations.\" This directly indicates that Oyster cards cannot be used at Epsom station.\n\nAdditionally, the context provides information about other nearby stations (Epsom Downs and Tattenham Corner) that are in the Oyster card zone, further emphasizing that Epsom station itself is not included in this system.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that Oyster cards are not accepted at Epsom railway station.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: False

Example 4
Question: {q4}
Inference: The context provides information about ABA routing transit numbers (ABA RTN), which are nine-digit codes used in the United States to identify financial institutions on negotiable instruments like checks. The term \"transit number\" is not explicitly mentioned in the given context, but we can infer that it likely refers to the same concept as the routing number.\n\nBoth \"bank transit number\" and \"routing number\" seem to serve the same purpose: identifying the financial institution associated with a particular transaction or account. The context mentions that the ABA RTN was originally designed for sorting and processing paper checks, but has since been expanded to accommodate other payment methods like ACH and Wire transfers.\n\nGiven that the terms appear to refer to the same nine-digit code used for identifying banks and facilitating transactions, it is reasonable to conclude that \"bank transit number\" and \"routing number\" are indeed the same thing, just different names for the same concept.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: True

Example 5
Question: {q5}
Inference: The context provides information about the Cleveland Browns\' performance in a specific season, mentioning that they finished with a 1-15 record. This indicates that they did win one game during that season. However, the question asks about "last season," which is not explicitly defined in the given context.\n\nThe context also mentions that this poor performance "marked the beginning of a 17 game losing streak continuing through the 2017 season and ending with a tie in Week 1 of the 2018 season." This suggests that the Browns did not win any games in the season following the 1-15 record, which would be the 2017 season.\n\nGiven this information, we can infer that if "last season" refers to the season immediately following the 1-15 record (likely the 2017 season), then the Browns did not win any games.\n\nFinal Answer: False

Example 6
Question: {q6}
Inference: Based on the given context, there is no indication of a seventh season of \"The Originals.\" The information provided states that the fifth season was announced as the final season by the series creator Julie Plec. The fifth and final season debuted on April 18, 2018. Since the show's conclusion was explicitly announced and the last season aired, it is highly unlikely that there would be a seventh season.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: False

Question: {q1}
Inference: Persian, known as Farsi in Iran, is the predominant language spoken in both Iran and Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, the official variant of Persian is referred to as Dari. Both languages share a common linguistic heritage and are mutually intelligible, but they have some regional differences in pronunciation, vocabulary, and usage. Therefore, while they are different in terms of dialects, they are essentially the same language family.\n\nFinal Answer: True

Example 2
Question: {q2}
Inference: Good Samaritan laws are designed to protect individuals who voluntarily assist those in distress, such as victims of accidents, by preventing them from being sued or facing legal repercussions for their actions, even if those actions unintentionally cause harm. This legal protection is specifically intended to encourage bystanders to help without the fear of liability, promoting a culture of assistance in emergencies. Therefore, yes, Good Samaritan laws do protect those who help at an accident.\n\nFinal Answer: True

Example 3
Question: {q3}
Inference: The context indicates that Epsom railway station is not located within the London Oyster card zone, which means that Oyster cards cannot be used for travel at this station. This implies that travelers would need to use other forms of payment. Therefore, it can be concluded that Oyster cards are not accepted at Epsom station.\n\nFinal Answer: False

Example 4
Question: {q4}
Inference: The terms \"bank transit number\" and \"routing number\" refer to the same concept in the context of the U.S. banking system. The ABA routing transit number (ABA RTN) serves to identify financial institutions and facilitate transactions such as check processing, ACH, and wire transfers. Therefore, a bank transit number is another way to refer to a routing number.\n\nFinal Answer: True

Example 5
Question: {q5}
Inference: The context states that the Browns finished the season with a 1\u201315 record, which indicates they won only one game throughout the entire season. This also emphasizes that they failed to win any division games and did not secure any road victories. Therefore, based on this information, the Cleveland Browns did not win any games last season beyond that one victory.\n\nFinal Answer: False

Example 6
Question: {q6}
Inference: Based on the provided context, the series \"The Originals\" was renewed for a fifth season, which was confirmed to be its last season. Since it was explicitly stated that the fifth season would be the final season and it premiered on April 18, 2018, it indicates that no further seasons, including a seventh season, were produced after that.\n\nFinal Answer: False
