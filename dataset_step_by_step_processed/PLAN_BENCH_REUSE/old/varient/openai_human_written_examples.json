The red block is already on top of the blue block, which is on the table, and these conditions satisfy the parts of the goal dealing with those blocks and their position. However, the orange block is not clear since the yellow block is on top of it.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal, we start with examining the initial conditions: the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, and the blocks are stacked in the following order from top to bottom: blue on orange, orange on yellow, yellow on red, with the red block on the table. The task is to have the blue block, orange block, and yellow block clear, the hand empty, the yellow block on top of the red block, and the red block on the table with the other blocks on the table too.\n\n1. **Unstack Blue from Orange**: The blue block is currently on top of the orange block. Since the blue block is clear, it can be unstacked. The hand is empty initially, which permits this action. After this step, the blue block will be in hand.\n\n2. **Put Down Blue**: Since the goal is to have the blue block clear and on the table, it should be placed down once it's unstacked. This will leave the hand empty again.\n\n3. **Unstack Orange from Yellow**: After putting down the blue block, the orange block becomes clear. The hand is empty, allowing unstacking the orange from the yellow block. This action results in holding the orange block.\n\n4. **Put Down Orange**: To have the orange block clear and on the table as per the goal, the block should be placed down. The hand is now empty.\n\nBy following these steps, each block will be positioned according to the goals: the blue, orange, and yellow blocks will be clear on the table, the hand will be empty, and the yellow block will end up on top of the red block, which remains on the table.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)",

To resolve this, we need to unstack the orange block from the blue block. However, the immediate task is to achieve the stated goal: that the hand is holding the yellow block.

The goal requires that the red block be on top of the blue block and the orange block be clear. In addition, the hand should be holding the yellow block. To achieve this, we need to first unstack and move the blocks accordingly. Here is the breakdown:\n\n1. Unstack yellow from red because the yellow block is initially on top of the red block.\n2. Put down the yellow block on the table temporarily to free the hand.\n3. Unstack the red block from the orange block so that the red block can be moved to the blue block.\n4. Stack the red block on top of the yellow block temporarily since the yellow block shouldn't be the final goal below the red block.\n5. Unstack the orange block from the blue block to make the blue block clear.\n6. Put down the orange block on the table to satisfy the goal of having the orange block on the table.\n7.

The goal is to have the yellow block on top of the orange block while the red block remains clear on the table, and the blue block remains on the table. \n\nThe current condition already has the blue block on the table, satisfying part of the goal. The orange block is on the table as well, which also satisfies part of the goal. The red block must be moved without anything on top of it, and the yellow block should be placed back onto the orange block. We must make sure the hand is empty at the end.\n\nTo achieve this:\n\n1.

The blue block should also be on top of the red block, while the red block, orange block, and yellow block should all be on the table.\n\nInitially, the blue block is not clear because the yellow block is on top of it. To start, we'll address this by unstacking the yellow block from the blue block. This will involve the following steps:\n\n1. Unstack the yellow block from the blue block, which makes the blue block clear and fulfills the requirement for the hand to hold the yellow block temporarily.\n2. Put down the yellow block on the table, thereby completing the action of having the hand empty again and ensuring the yellow block is on the table.\n\nAfter these steps, the conditions will be satisfied since the blue block will now be clear and the yellow block will be on the table.

According to the initial conditions, the yellow block is already on top of the red block, and the red block is on the table, which aligns with the goal. The orange block is also on the table, as required. The only goal that has not been satisfied is having the orange block clear and the yellow block clear while holding the blue block. The blue block is currently on top of the yellow block, which means we need to unstack the blue block from the yellow block to both hold the blue block and make the yellow block clear.

        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE\nTo satisfy the goal, we must ensure that the red, blue, and orange blocks are clear, the blocks are placed correctly, and the hand is empty at the end. Initially, the red block is clear and on top of the orange block, which means we need to unstack the red block from the orange one first. Once unstacked, we place the red block on the table. Next, the orange block is on top of the blue; to clear the blue and move the orange to the table, unstack the orange block from the blue block. Put down the orange block on the table to satisfy that condition. Now the blue block is already on the yellow block, which satisfies the requirement for the blue block. After performing these moves, all blocks should be clear and on the table while keeping the hand empty.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)",

        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE\n\nGiven the initial conditions, the red block is clear and is on top of the orange block. The plan is to have the blue block on top of the orange block and the orange block on top of the red block; this requires rearranging the blocks. The first step in the plan is to unstack the red block from on top of the orange block. Next, the red block needs to be put down onto the table. Then, the orange block, which is on top of the yellow block, must be unstacked and should be stacked on top of the red block. This arrangement sets up the condition where the orange is on the red. Finally, the blue block should be picked up from the table and stacked on top of the orange block, resulting in the goal configuration.\n\nFor the second statement, we need to achieve a configuration where the orange block is on top of the red block and both these blocks, as well as the blue and yellow blocks, are on the table while ensuring all blocks are clear, and the hand is empty. The first step would be unstacking the red block from the orange block, making the red clear on the table. Next, unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block, and then stack the orange block on the red block, achieving part of the goal. The red is now on the table, and the orange is on the red. The blue and yellow blocks are on the table, and all blocks will be clear and the hand empty at the end of the process.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(stack orange red)",

We will unstack the yellow block from the orange block.\n2. Once unstacked, the yellow block needs to be put down onto the table.\n3. Pick up the red block from the table since it is clear.\n4. Stack the red block on top of the yellow block, this satisfies our goal condition of having the red block on the yellow block.\n5. At this point, the goal conditions are satisfied with clearance of specific blocks and their respective positions.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red yellow)",

Our goal requires the blue block, orange block, and yellow block to be clear, and the red block should be held by the hand while the blue block, orange block, and yellow block are on the table.\n\n1. First, we need to make sure the yellow block, which is on top of the orange block, is on the table so that the orange block can be clear. We unstack the yellow block from the orange block.\n2.

Therefore, we proceed with the following actions:\n\n1. **Unstack the Blue Block from on top of the Red Block:** Since the blue block is clear, we can unstack it to hold it.\n2. **Put Down the Blue Block:** To clear space and ensure that the blue block is on the table.\n3. **Unstack the Red Block from on top of the Orange Block:** Reducing the stack to isolate the red block as needed.\n4. **Stack the Red Block on top of the Blue Block:** Move towards building the final arrangement where the red is on top of the blue.\n5. **Unstack the Orange Block from on top of the Yellow Block:** Clearing the yellow to meet the condition that each block is clear.\n6. **Put Down the Orange Block:** Places the orange block on the table, ensuring that all four blocks are resting on it.\n\nThese actions will result in the red block being on top of the blue block, with the blue, orange, and yellow blocks clear and on the table, while the hand stays empty.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack red orange)\n(stack red blue)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)",

The red block is currently on top of the yellow block, and the blue block is on top of the red block. The yellow block is on top of the orange block, which is on the table. The objectives include having the red block clear, the blue block clear, and both the blue and orange blocks on the table, with the red block on top of the yellow block and the yellow block on top of the orange block.\n\nFirstly, the red block needs to be cleared, meaning the blue block must be removed from its current position on top of the red block. Since the blue block is clear and the hand is empty, we can unstack the blue block from the red block.\n\nAfter unstacking, we hold the blue block in our hand. To ensure that both the blue and orange blocks end up on the table, we need to put down the blue block. This move also satisfies the conditions of clearing both the red and blue blocks regarding having no blocks on top of them. With the yellow block already on top of the orange block and the red block on top of the yellow block as initially desired, and both the blue and orange blocks on the table, the hand becomes empty upon putting down the blue block.\n\nWith these steps, all the conditions are met for the goal.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)",

The goal states that the red block should end up clear, on the table, and not on the other blocks. The first action is to unstack the red block from the orange block as the red block is currently clear and can be moved using an empty hand. Action: (unstack red orange)\n\n2.

The blue block and the orange block are on the table, and the hand is empty. The goal is to have the blue block clear, the yellow block clear, the hand holding the red block, the yellow block on top of the orange block, and both the blue and orange blocks on the table.\n\nTo achieve these conditions:\n1. The hand needs to hold the red block, which requires unstacking the red block from the top of the yellow block. This satisfies both making the red block able to be held and the act of holding it.\n2. Unstacking the red block leaves the yellow block clear.\n3. The yellow block should be on top of the orange block, which already matches the initial conditions and hence requires no action.\n4. The blue block being clear is already satisfied in the initial conditions. \n\nTherefore, the first step to reach the desired goal state is to unstack the red block from the yellow block so that the red block is held by the hand.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red yellow)",

Then, we put down the blue block to free up the red block. Next, we unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block and put it down. This makes the yellow block clear and ready to be moved. We then unstack the yellow block from the orange block, allowing us to stack the yellow on the red block. With the yellow block on top of the red block, we pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the blue block, which satisfies the condition of the blue block being on the table and the orange on top of the blue.

        "answer": "To satisfy the goal, the first step is to make each block clear. We start by unstacking the yellow block from on top of the orange block and putting it down because currently, the yellow block covers the orange. Once the yellow block is put down, repeat the unstacking procedure for the orange block from the blue block and then place the orange on the table. This action ensures the orange block is free from obstruction. Consequently, unstack the blue block from on top of the red block so that it becomes clear and put it down. Leaving the red block, which was originally at the base, pick up the red block finally as per the goal to have the hand currently holding the red block. The actions correspond to reaching the end-state where blue, orange, and yellow blocks are clear and on the table, with the hand holding the red block.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up red)",

        "answer": "Inference: To achieve the goal state, we need to ensure that specific conditions are met for the blocks. Initially, the red block is on top of the yellow block, and the orange block is on top of the red block. Both the orange and blue blocks are initially clear. However, the required goal states that the orange block needs to be on top of the blue block, and we need the red, blue, and yellow blocks to be on the table, with only the orange block on top of other blocks.\n\n1. The initial clear condition for the orange block allows us to unstack it from the red block first while the hand is empty to hold the block.\n2. Once the orange block is held, stack it on the blue block to achieve the position specified in the goal, utilizing the clear state of the blue block.\n3. Next, unstack the red block from the yellow block since both blocks are initially aligned, allowing the red block to be clear and freely repositioned from the stack.\n4. Finally, put down the red block on the table to meet the condition where it should be clear, as required in the goal.\n\nFollowing these steps will fulfill the goal conditions effectively without altering the positions of the blue and yellow blocks beyond necessity.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange red)\n(stack orange blue)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)",

        "answer": "Inference: The initial condition states that the orange block is clear and the hand is empty. The red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the red block, and the orange block is on top of the blue block. The goal conditions are: the red block must remain on top of the yellow block, the blue block must be on top of the orange block, and both the orange block and the yellow block should be on the table. Additionally, the red block and blue block should be clear, and the hand should be empty at the end.\n\nTo achieve these goals, we need to first unstack the orange block from the blue block (making the blue block clear), then put the orange block down on the table. Next, we unstack the blue block from the red block so that the red is clear while holding the blue block. The next step is to stack the blue block on top of the orange block which meets part of the goal condition and frees our hand, resulting in both the blue block being on top of the orange block and the red block remaining on top of the yellow block (as required). Since the final positions for the orange block and the yellow block are on the table, they need to be clear, which our previous steps accomplish.\nAs the hand is empty and positioning conditions from the goal are fulfilled, we stop here.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack blue red)\n(stack blue orange)",

        "answer": "Inference: To satisfy the goal conditions from the initial conditions, we need to perform a sequence of actions. Initially, the red block is on top of the blue block and the orange block is on top of the yellow block. We want the red block on top of the orange block while ensuring that the red, blue, and yellow blocks are clear at the end. The initial action must be to unstack the orange block from the yellow block to begin making the orange block clear for future stacking. The blue block is already on the table, fulfilling that part of the goal, while the red block needs to be on top of the orange block at the end.\n\nSteps:\n1. Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block to clear the orange block for stacking and ensure it's on the table.\n2. Put down the orange block to empty the hand and have the orange block on the table.\n3.

According to the initial conditions, the blue block is on top of the red block, which means the red block is not clear. The blue block must be unstacked from the red block to make the red block clear. Once the blue block is unstacked, it needs to be put down on the table to satisfy the condition of all blocks being on the table. The hand becomes empty once the blue block is put down.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. The first action is to unstack the orange block from the blue block because the orange block is clear, allowing us to hold it.\n   \n2. Next, we put down the orange block to free up our hand while making the orange block part of the base upon which the blue block will eventually rest.\n\n3. We then need to unstack the blue block from the red block because our hand is empty and this action makes sure the blue block is held, in preparation for stacking it later.\n\n4. Stack the blue block on top of the orange block. This action follows the condition that we can only stack a block we're holding and the block being stacked onto must be clear, which the orange block is, having been previously put down.\n\n5. Unstack the red block from the yellow block since the hand is empty again. The red block is initially on top of the yellow block, meeting the requirement for unstacking.\n\n6.

The goal is to have the blue block clear, the orange block clear, the yellow block clear, the hand empty, the blue block on top of the red block, the red block on the table, the orange block on the table, and the yellow block on the table.\n\nTo achieve this goal:\n1. The orange block is initially on top of the blue block, making the blue block not clear. We need to unstack the orange block from the blue block so that the blue block becomes clear.\n2.

Therefore, the plan is to pick up the yellow block.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up yellow)",

The yellow block is currently on top of the orange block, making the orange block not clear. To achieve the goal where the orange block is clear and the hand is holding the yellow block, the first step would be to unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State Analysis:** The blue and yellow blocks are clear on the table, the orange block is on top of the red block (which is on the table), and the hand is empty.\n\n2. **Goal Analysis:** We need the red block on top of the blue block. Then the orange block should be on top of the red block, and the yellow block on top of the orange block. Meanwhile, the current goal requires the orange block to be on top of the red block, and the hand holding the yellow block.\n\n3. **Block Manipulation Steps:**\n   - **Unstack orange from red:** The orange block is clear and on top of the red block.\n   - **Stack orange on yellow:** Once we unstack orange, we hold it and can place it on the clear yellow block.\n   - **Pick up red:** The red block is now clear (as orange was removed).\n   - **Stack red on blue:** Now that blue is clear and we are holding red, stack red on blue.\n   - **Unstack orange from yellow:** Orange is on yellow and both are clear, unstack orange.\n   - **Stack orange on red:** As we hold orange now, and red is on blue, place orange on red.\n   - **Pick up yellow:** The yellow block is now clear. Pick it up.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange red)  \n(stack orange yellow)  \n(pick-up red)  \n(stack red blue)  \n(unstack orange yellow)  \n(stack orange red)  \n(pick-up yellow)  ",

        "answer": "Inference: Starting with the initial conditions, we have that the orange block, yellow block, and the hand are clear or empty. The red block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, the blue block and the orange block are both on the table. The goal requires that the red block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is holding the yellow block, and the red block remains on top of the blue block. Currently, the red block is not clear because the yellow block is on top of it. In order to meet the goal where the hand is holding the yellow block and the red block is clear, we can perform the action of unstacking the yellow block from the red block. This will clear the red block and the hand will hold the yellow block.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow red)",

        "answer": "To reach the goal state from the given initial conditions, the following steps are necessary:\n\n1. **Initial Condition Check:** The initial conditions provided are that the red block is clear, the orange block is clear, and the hand is empty. Additionally, the red block is on top of the blue block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on the table, and the yellow block is on the table.\n\n2. **Goal Condition Analysis:** We want the red block and the orange block to be clear, the hand to be currently holding the yellow block, the orange block to be on top of the blue block, the red block to be on the table, and the blue block to be on the table.\n\n3. **Strategy to Achieve the Goal:**\n\n   a. **Clear the Red Block from the Blue Block:** \n      - Unstack the red block from on top of the blue block, satisfying the condition that the red block and the blue block need to be on the table.\n      - Put down the red block. Now the red block is clear and on the table, and the hand is empty.\n\n   b. **Position the Orange Block:** \n      - Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block.\n      - Stack the orange block on top of the blue block. Now, the orange block is on top of the blue block, leaving the yellow block clear.\n\n   c. **Prepare the Hand to Hold the Yellow Block:**\n      - Pick up the yellow block. Now the hand is currently holding the yellow block as desired.\n\nThese actions align with the restrictions given, allowing only one block to be moved at a time and requiring the hand to be empty before picking up or unstacking a block.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up yellow)",

The requirement is to have the red, blue, and yellow blocks on the table and the orange block on top of the yellow block. To achieve this, we need to make sure that the red block is clear, meaning that no other block should be stacked on top of it. The blue block should also be clear and on the table. Furthermore, the orange block, after stacking it on the yellow block, should be clear.

At the same time, all blocks (red, blue, orange) must be clear and on the table, and the hand must be holding the yellow block. Currently, the hand is not holding any block, and the yellow block is not clear because it is on top of the red block. To hold the yellow block, the first step is to unstack it from the red block.

        "answer": "Inference: \n\nTo achieve the goal of having the red block, blue block, and orange block all clear with the hand empty, and the blue block on top of the yellow block, we need to focus on the relationship between the blocks:\n\n1. The initial condition states that the orange block is on top of the blue block.\n2. To make the blue, orange, and red blocks clear, any block currently on another must be moved.\n3. The blue block being on top of the yellow block already satisfies part of the goal condition.\n4. Therefore, first, unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block.\n5. Once that is done, the orange block needs to be placed somewhere to ensure it is clear and not obstructing any other blocks already clear.\n6. Put down the orange block on the table, ensuring it is not on another block.\n\nThese steps ensure that:\n- Blue block is clear (as it was initially only covered by orange).\n- Red block remains clear throughout as no actions involve stacking on it.\n- Orange block is also clear, having been put down on the table without other blocks on it.\n- The hand will be empty as the last action, putting down the orange block, leaves the hand empty.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)",

The goal requires having the red, orange, and yellow blocks clear and on the table, and the hand holding the blue block. Since the yellow block is on top of the red block and is clear, we begin by unstacking the yellow block from the red block to achieve the target state where the yellow block is on the table. Then we proceed to unstack the red block from the blue block so that the red block can be placed on the table and to make the blue block accessible.

        "answer": "Based on the initial conditions, let's infer the necessary steps to achieve the goal:\n\n1. The goal states that the red block, blue block, and orange block must be clear. Currently, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is on top of the orange block. Therefore, both the blue block and yellow block need to be unstacked sequentially to ensure the orange block becomes clear.\n\n2. The red block, blue block, and orange block already being on the table satisfy part of the goal conditions. The task is to manipulate the blocks such that we end up holding the yellow block while ensuring the red, blue, and orange blocks are clear and on the table. \n\n3. Starting with the hand empty, we can unstack the blue block from the yellow block. This action makes the blue block clear and allows us to continue towards the goal.\n\n4. Once the blue block is unstacked, to satisfy the condition of holding the yellow block, we need to put down the blue block. This step empties the hand, making it ready for the next necessary action.\n\n5. Next, we can unstack the yellow block from the orange block, leaving us holding the yellow block, which is the final desired state for the hand. \n\nIn summary, by performing these steps, we satisfy all the goal conditions.

        "answer": "Inference: To satisfy the goal conditions, we need to make sure that the red block is clear, the orange block is clear, and the hand is empty. Currently, the red block is on top of the orange block, and the blue block is on top of the yellow block. For the orange block to be clear, it needs to be on top of the blue block instead. As per the initial conditions, the red block, which is clear and on top of the orange block, needs to be unstacked first to free up the orange block for repositioning. This can be done by unstacking the red block from the orange block and putting it down. After unstacking the red block, the next step is to pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the blue block. Following this, the red block, now on the table and clear, can be placed back on the orange block to satisfy the final positioning.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)",

Therefore, for the orange block to remain clear, it needs to be the top block, which is already satisfied as per the goal condition (orange block is clear). \n\nThe yellow block is currently on the table with the blue block on top of it.

        "answer": "Inference: Initially, the red block is clear and the hand is empty, allowing us to unstack the red block from the orange block. Once the red block is unstacked, we can put it down on the table, which makes it clear and satisfies the goal of having the red block on the table. Now, the orange block is clear as there is nothing on top of it. The hand is empty, which partly satisfies the goal conditions. \n\nHowever, we also need the orange block to be on top of the yellow block, which it already is in the initial condition. Moreover, the yellow block is already on top of the blue block, and both are correctly positioned, according to the goal. Since unstacking the red block and putting it down will not disturb the required final position of the other blocks, no further actions are required besides ensuring the red block is put on the table and the hand is empty. This sequence also indirectly fulfills the need for the orange block to be clear since it is part of the already established stack order that fits the goal conditions. \n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)",

This action clears the blue block and makes it the current block being held.\n- The hand is now holding the blue block, so goal condition \"hand is currently holding blue block\" is satisfied.\n\nNext, ensure the goal states are satisfied with the least additional actions:\n- Since the red block is clear and already on top of the orange block, there's no need to move it. That goal condition is already met.\n- To maintain the structure, ensure the orange block is on top of the yellow block. It's already in position, so no need to change it.\n- Finally, hold the blue block, which was achieved by the first step.\n\nThus, the final steps are detailed and checked, and they fulfill the goal with the minimal necessary movements.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue yellow)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal, we must consider the constraints and initial positions of the blocks. Currently, the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, and the orange block is on top of the yellow block, with the yellow block resting on the table. Our objective is to have the red, blue, and yellow blocks clear, the hand holding the orange block, and the red, blue, and yellow blocks on the table.\n\n1. **Unstack the red block from the blue block**: The red block is currently clear and on top of the blue block. Since the hand is empty, we can unstack the red block to hold it.\n2. **Put down the red block**: After unstacking, we are holding the red block and can put it on the table.\n3. **Unstack the blue block from the orange block**: Now, the blue block is clear and can be unstacked from the orange block. We can hold the blue block in our hand once the red block has been placed on the table, leaving our hands empty again.\n4. **Put down the blue block**: Place the blue block on the table.\n5. **Unstack the orange block from the yellow block**: After placing down the blue block, the orange block is clear and can be unstacked from the yellow block.

The primary goals are to have the orange block clear, yellow block clear, hold the blue block, have the yellow block on top of the red block, and keep both the red and orange blocks on the table.\n\nSteps to logical inference:\n\n1. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block:** This action is necessary because the yellow block is currently on the blue block. By unstacking, the yellow block will be removed from the blue block, making the blue block clear, satisfying part of the condition needed for holding the blue block.\n\n2. **Stack the yellow block on top of the red block:** This action meets the condition of having the yellow block on top of the red block since the red block is clear and available for stacking.\n\n3. **Pick up the blue block:** With the yellow block no longer on top of the blue block and once the yellow block is stacked on the red block, the blue block becomes clear, allowing it to be picked up, thus achieving the condition of having the blue block in hand while leaving the orange block on the table. \n\nAfter following these actions, all stipulated goals are accomplished.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow blue)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up blue)",

The goal requires the red and yellow blocks to be clear. Currently, the yellow block is on top of the red block. Thus, the yellow block needs to be removed from the red block.\n2. Since the yellow block is clear and the hand is empty, we can unstack the yellow block from the red block.\n3.

The red block is currently on top of the yellow block, and the yellow is on the blue block, with both the blue and orange blocks on the table. The hand is empty.\n\n1. The first step in achieving the desired arrangement is to ensure the yellow block ends up on top of the red block, with both the red and yellow blocks being clear. We achieve this by unstacking the red block from on top of the yellow block.\n2. Since we're holding the red block now, we put it down on the table, to ensure that we have one block space on which to restack the yellow block on top of it later.\n3. Next, we unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block, and now we're holding the yellow block.\n4. We can then stack the yellow block on top of the red block.\n5. Now, with the blue block being free, we pick up the blue block.\n\nThese steps satisfy the condition that has the orange block as clear, the yellow block as clear, the hand holding the blue block, and the yellow block on top of the red block, while ensuring both the red block and orange block are on the table.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up blue)",

The red, orange, and yellow blocks should be clear.\n  2. The hand should be empty.\n  3. The orange block must be on top of the blue block.\n  4. The red, blue, and yellow blocks should be on the table.\n\nSteps:\n1. The orange block is on top of the blue block, which aligns with the goal.\n2. The red and blue blocks are already on the table.\n3. The issue is the yellow block is on the orange block, blocking it from being clear.\n\nTo solve this:\n- First, unstack the yellow block from the orange block, which makes both the orange and yellow blocks clear.\n- Then, put down the yellow block on the table to have all blocks on the table and achieve the goal state of having your hand empty.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)",

The process of achieving the goal is as follows:\n\n1. **Unstack Blue from Orange:** Since the blue block is on top of the orange block and the initial condition allows it (as the blue block is clear), the first action is to unstack the blue block from the orange block.\n\n2. **Stack Blue on Yellow:** With the blue block held after unstacking it from the orange block, we can place it on top of the yellow block because the yellow block is on the table and clear.\n\n3. **Pick Up Red Block:** Now, with an empty hand again, pick up the red block from the table.

        "answer": "The initial conditions specify that the blue block is clear, and the hand is empty. The blue block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the red block, and the yellow block is on top of the orange block. Given these conditions, the goal is to have the blue block, orange block, and yellow block all clear, with the hand empty, the orange block on top of the red block, and the blue, yellow, and red blocks on the table. \n\nTo achieve this:\n1. The blue block must be moved first because it's already clear and on top of the yellow block, which will make the yellow block directly accessible.\n2. Unstack the blue block from the yellow block to clear it.\n3. Put down the blue block on the table as it's required to be on the table.\n4. Now, with the yellow block clear, unstack it from the orange block.\n5. Put down the yellow block on the table.\n6. Finally, the orange block, after unstacking the yellow block, will remain on top of the red block as desired.\n\nThese steps will satisfy the goal conditions.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)",

        "answer": "To solve this puzzle, I need to follow the steps to achieve the goal where the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, and I'm holding the blue block while the orange block is on top of the red block, and both the red and yellow blocks are on the table.\n\n1. Start by unstacking the yellow block from on top of the blue block. This action makes the blue block clear.\n2. After unstacking, put down the yellow block to ensure my hand becomes empty again.\n3. Now, unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block. At this point, I'm holding the blue block as required in the goal.\n4. Next, stack the blue block on top of the yellow block temporarily.\n5. Pick up the orange block, which is now clear after the blue block has been unstacked.\n6. Stack the orange block on top of the red block, fulfilling part of the goal where the orange block is on top of the red block.\n7. Finally, unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block so that I'm holding the blue block to meet one of the final conditions of the goal.\n\nWith these steps, the goal will be achieved as planned.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow blue)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)\n(unstack blue yellow)",
