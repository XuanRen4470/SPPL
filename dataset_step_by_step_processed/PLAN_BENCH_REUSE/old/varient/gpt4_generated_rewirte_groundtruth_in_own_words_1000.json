        "answer": "In this task, you need to arrange blocks given certain conditions and a goal state. Initially, you have a blue block and an orange block that are both clear, meaning they have no blocks on top of them, and your hand is empty. The setting is such that the orange block is on top of a yellow block, which is further on top of a red block. The red block and the blue block are both on the table.\n\nYour goal is to achieve a specific arrangement where the blue block remains on the table, the yellow block is on top of the red block (similar to the initial state), and the hand is holding the orange block, while ensuring that both the blue and yellow blocks are clear. \n\nConsidering these requirements, the action you need to take to achieve the desired goal state is straightforward. You should remove the orange block from the top of the yellow block to hold it in your hand, keeping both the yellow block (which remains on the red block) and the blue block clear on the table.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange yellow)",

        "answer": "[PLAN]\n\n1. The first step is to remove the orange block which is currently on top of the blue block. This is done by unstacking the orange block from the blue block. Since the orange block is clear and the hand is empty, we can perform this action.\n\n2. After unstacking the orange block, the next step is to put the orange block down onto the table. This frees up my hand and makes the orange block clear on the table.\n\n3. Now, we need to unstack the blue block from the yellow block. This is possible since the blue block is clear after removing the orange block. We unstack the blue block and hold it in the hand.\n\n4. Then, we put down the blue block onto the table. The blue block is now clear as it's on the table.\n\n5. Next, we unstack the yellow block from the red block.

        "answer": "To achieve the desired goal state based on the initial conditions and permitted actions, the plan must follow a sequence that ensures all conditions are met properly. Here's the process:\n\n1. **Unstack the Red Block from the Orange Block**: Since the red block is initially on the orange block and is clear, you can unstack it while your hand is empty. This action makes both the red and orange blocks clear.\n2. **Put Down the Red Block**: After unstacking, you are holding the red block. You can now put it down on the table to make your hand free again.\n3. **Pick Up the Orange Block**: The orange block is now clear since the red block was removed from its top. You can pick up the orange block with your empty hand.\n4. **Stack the Orange Block on Top of the Yellow Block**: You have to hold the orange block to stack it on top of the yellow block which is on the table and clear.\n5. **Pick Up the Blue Block**: The plan concludes by picking up the blue block, which is clear and on the table, to have your hand holding it.\n\nThis series of actions will lead to the desired final configuration where the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the red block is on the table, and the hand is holding the blue block.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up blue)",

        "answer": "1. The given situation involves a set of blocks with specific initial conditions and goals. The constraints define the actions you can perform with the blocks. \n\n2. Initially, you have a blue block, an orange block, and a yellow block that are all clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The hand is empty initially. The yellow block is on top of the red block, which is on the table, and the blue block and orange block are also on the table.\n\n3. Your goal is to have the hand holding the blue block while ensuring that both the orange block and yellow block remain clear, and the yellow block stays on top of the red block, with the red block on the table and the orange block on the table.\n\n4. To achieve the goal, as outlined, you can begin by picking up the blue block, as this action will make you hold the blue block while keeping the conditions of the other blocks aligned with the goal statement.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up blue)",

        "answer": "Given the initial conditions, we have the following setup: the blue block and yellow block are clear, and the hand is empty. The blue block is sitting atop the orange block, which in turn sits on the red block, with the red block resting on the table. The yellow block is also on the table. Our objective involves rearranging these blocks so that the red block ends up on top of the blue block, the orange block is placed over the red block, and the yellow block stacks atop the orange block.\n\nHere\u2019s a logical sequence of actions to achieve this goal, considering the existing constraints:\n\nFirst, since the blue block is clear and on top of the orange block, we unstack it from the orange block. With the block in hand, we then put down the blue block onto the table. Next, we focus on the orange block, which is now clear and on the red block, and proceed to unstack it. With the orange block in hand, we stack it on top of the yellow block, which is on the table.\n\nThen, we pick up the red block from the table. Holding the red block, we stack it over the blue block. Following this, we return to the orange block that is on the yellow block and unstack it once more.

        "answer": "Initially, we need to focus on the given conditions and rules to reach the defined goal. The provided conditions state that the orange block is on top of the red block, which in turn is on a stack with the blue block. Our goal is to have all blocks, including the red block, orange block, and blue block clear; meanwhile, the blue block remains on the yellow block directly, and the orange and red blocks should be placed separately on the table.\n\nWe begin by unstacking the orange block, which starts on top of the red block, making the red block clear. We then proceed to put the orange block down separately on the table. With this move completed, we can now unstack the red block from the blue block, as it is clear and feasible with our empty hand. Following this, placing the red block on the table will fulfill the requirement of having the red block be clear on the table without anything on top.\n\nBy sequentially following these actions, we ensure that the desired state is achieved with all specified conditions met. The blocks are thus arranged according to the final goal successfully.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack orange red)  \n(put-down orange)  \n(unstack red blue)  \n(put-down red)",

The goal is to manipulate this arrangement to achieve a scenario where the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the hand is holding the yellow block, and both the blue block and the orange block are on the table.\n\nTo achieve this, we'll execute the following plan:\n\n1. Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block, making the orange block independent.\n2. Put down the orange block on the table.\n3. Unstack the blue block from on top of the red block, freeing the blue block.\n4. Stack the blue block on top of the orange block, which is now on the table.\n5. Pick up the yellow block, ensuring that the hand ends up holding the yellow block.\n\nIn summary, the final steps taken to achieve the goal will be executed in this order:\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack blue red)\n(stack blue orange)\n(pick-up yellow)",

        "answer": "Given the conditions and actions permitted, start by focusing on the requirement to have the hand holding the red block while keeping other conditions intact. Initially, the red block is clear, and the hand is empty, which allows the action of picking up the red block. Consequently, this action will leave the red block in your hand, fulfilling the goal condition regarding it. Additionally, the blue block remains on top of the orange block, and both the yellow and orange blocks stay on the table, aligning with the goal state. Thus, the initial move to pick up the red block directly satisfies the necessary conditions without affecting the arrangement of other blocks negatively.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up red)",

Once the red block is unstacked, you will put it down on the table. This clears the way for handling the yellow block. With an empty hand, you will then pick up the yellow block. Next, you will stack the yellow block on top of the red block, forming part of your desired stack structure. Now, the blue block needs to be moved from its current position atop the orange block, so you unstack the blue block from the orange block.

        "answer": "In the initial arrangement, you have an empty hand and several blocks stacked in various ways: the red block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block, and the blue block is on top of the orange block, which rests on the table. Your goal is to rearrange these blocks so that the blue block ends up on top of the orange block, which is on the table, while the red block, yellow block, and orange block are also placed directly on the table. Importantly, you need to ensure that by the end of the process, the red, blue, and yellow blocks are all clear, meaning that no blocks are on top of them. Here's how you can accomplish this step-by-step:\n\nFirst, you need to unstack the red block from the yellow block, leaving the red block in your hand (since it is clear, given there's nothing on top of it). Next, you put down the red block directly onto the table. This action leaves your hand empty and the red block clear.\n\nProceed by unstacking the yellow block from on top of the blue block. After unstacking, put down the yellow block on the table as well. At this point, your hand becomes empty again, and the yellow block is clear.\n\nNow, your existing arrangement allows you to retain the blue block on top of the orange block since the red, yellow, and blue blocks should ultimately be clear, and the orange block remains on the table. This sequence of unstacking and placing ensures the blue block is on the orange block as required, and the red, yellow, and blue blocks are all clear, completing your objective.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(put-down yellow)",

        "answer": "In order to achieve the goal where the red block, blue block, and orange block are all clear, and the hand is holding the yellow block, we need to unstack certain blocks and put them down appropriately. Starting with the initial setup where the orange block is on top of the red block, and the yellow block is on top of the blue block, we need to ensure all blocks except the yellow one are on the table and clear. The steps to achieve this are as follows:\n\nFirst, unstack the orange block from on top of the red block, making the red block clear again. Then, place the orange block on the table to ensure it is also clear. Next, unstack the yellow block from the blue block, leaving the blue block clear, and keep holding the yellow block in hand. This will fulfill the condition that the red block is on the table, blue block on the table, and orange block on the table, all clear, with the hand holding the yellow block.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack orange red)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack yellow blue)",

        "answer": "To achieve the final goal, we need to make sure each action aligns with both the rules and the initial conditions provided. Here's the step-by-step logic for reaching the desired state:\n\n1. Begin by unstacking the orange block from on top of the yellow block. Since the orange block is initially clear and the hand is empty, this action is allowed.\n2. Next, put down the orange block onto the table. This frees up the hand, allowing us to perform further actions.\n3. Unstack the red block from on top of the blue block. The red block is clear at this point, making it possible to unstack it with an empty hand.\n4. Stack the red block on top of the orange block. Since you are holding the red block and it is clear to stack onto the orange block (assuming it's clear after being put down), this completes part of the goal.\n\nFollowing these actions ensures that the goal conditions are met while adhering to the rules of the block manipulation. The final configuration with the red on top of the orange, and the blue, orange, and yellow blocks on the table, ensures all blocks are clear and the hand is empty, aligning perfectly with the required goal state.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack red blue)\n(stack red orange)",

The orange block itself is on the table. Your final goal requires that each block (red, orange, yellow) should be clear and on the table, except for the blue block which should be held in your hand. \n\nHere's how you can accomplish this:\n\n1. Start by unstacking the yellow block from on top of the blue block and put it down on the table; this fulfills the requirement of the yellow block being clear and on the table.\n\n2. Then, you need to unstack the blue block from on top of the red block, and stack this blue block that you're holding onto the yellow block currently on the table; this temporarily places the blue block on the table.\n\n3. Next, unstack the red block from on top of the orange block and put it down on the table, satisfying the condition for both the red block being clear and on the table.\n\n4.

        "answer": "To achieve the desired configuration where the red block is on top of the yellow block, you first need to clear the path by removing the blocks currently stacked. Start by unstacking the blue block from the orange block, which will leave the blue block free to be placed directly on the table. Next, unstack the orange block from the yellow block. With both the orange and blue blocks on the table, you then pick up the red block. Finally, you can place the red block on top of the yellow block, completing your goal.\n\nNow, to achieve the second goal where the blue, orange, and yellow blocks are all clear, and you are holding the red block, follow these steps. Begin by unstacking the blue block from the orange block and place the blue block on the table.

This action is possible because the red block is clear and my hand is empty. By unstacking the red block, I will hold it in my hand, and the orange block will become clear.\n\n3. After unstacking the red block, I need to put it down on the table. This action frees my hand and ensures the red block is positioned on the table.\n\n4. Next, I can unstack the orange block from the blue block. As my hand is now empty and the orange block is clear, I unstack it, thus holding the orange block while making the blue block clear.\n\n5. With the orange block held in my hand, I stack it on top of the red block, which must be clear at this stage. This action puts the orange block in its desired position on top of the red block.\n\nFollowing these steps will assist in achieving the required goal configuration of blocks:\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(stack orange red)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the blue block on the table, the orange block on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block on top of the red block, you need to rearrange the blocks by performing a sequence of actions. Begin by unstacking the red block from on top of the yellow block, ensuring that your hand is empty before starting. Once the red block is unstacked, put it down on the table. Next, pick up the yellow block, and stack it on top of the red block while keeping in mind that the yellow block can only be stacked on a clear block. Proceed by picking up the orange block and stacking it on the yellow block, maintaining the constraint that the block onto which you are stacking must be clear at the moment.

        "answer": "Given the initial conditions and the desired goal, the process involves rearranging the blocks methodically to achieve the specified end state. Starting with the blocks' original arrangement, you will follow a series of actions to unstack, put down, and then restack the blocks in the new configuration while adhering to the constraints provided.\n\nFirst, you need to remove the orange block from the yellow block, which is possible since the orange block is initially clear. Set the orange block down as a separate action. Then, unstack the yellow block from the blue block, subsequent to putting the orange block down. Next, stack the yellow block on top of the orange. This frees up the blue block, which you unstack from the red block, and then put down. Again, unstack the yellow block from the orange and restack it on top of the red block where it should end up. Upon picking up the blue block after it was put down, you stack it over the yellow block as intended.

Considering all the constraints and initial conditions, the correct first action to reach the desired final condition is to unstack the blue block from the red block. This allows the blue block to be held and clears the red block, which is part of the goal state.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue red)",

        "answer": "Given the initial conditions, we need to achieve our goal state by executing a series of actions while adhering to the restrictions provided. Initially, the blue block is situated on top of the red block, and both the blue and yellow blocks are clear, meaning they have no blocks on top of them and can be picked up.\n\nTo accomplish the goal state where the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue block, orange block, and yellow block are all on the table, and the hand is empty, we start by removing the blue block which is on top of the red block. This involves unstacking the blue block from the red block. Once we unstack the blue block, we can put it down on the table since the hand must be empty to perform further actions.\n\nCarrying out these steps will ensure that the specified goal state is met while following the constraints of placing blocks and ensuring the correct conditions on blocks and the hand. The final plan, thus, involves two key actions based on the goal and conditions.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)",

Throughout this process, we must consider the rules about when a block is clear and how we can interact with it.\n\nWe start by removing the red block, which is currently on top of the orange block. Since the red block is clear, we can unstack it from the orange block and put it on the table.\n\nNext, we focus on the blue block, which is situated on the yellow block. We need to unstack the blue block and place it on the table to make it clear.\n\nOnce that is done, we pick up the yellow block, which is now free, and we stack it on top of the red block, beginning to build the desired stack.\n\nThen, we pick up the orange block and position it on top of the yellow block. This finishes our arrangement with the orange block correctly on top of the yellow block.\n\nFinally, the blue block is already on the table and clear, as required. The hand becomes empty, and all goals are met.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)",

        "answer": "To achieve the desired final state of the blocks, I will follow a series of steps to rearrange them according to the specified conditions and actions allowed. Initially, the red block is on top of the blue block, with the blue block on the table, while the orange block and the yellow block are each individually on the table. The goal is to end up with the red block on top of the blue block, which in turn is on top of the orange block, with a clear red block, the orange block on the table, and the hand holding the yellow block. Here's the sequence of actions to reach that goal:\n\n1. First, unstack the red block from the blue block, which means taking the red block off the blue block. This makes the red block in hand and the blue block clear.\n\n2. Next, stack the red block on top of the yellow block. This action ensures the yellow block is now supporting the red block, leaving the hand empty.\n\n3. Pick up the blue block from the table. This action makes the blue block in hand and the table clear.\n\n4. Then, stack the blue block on top of the orange block. Now, the blue block is stacked on the orange block, and the hand becomes empty again.\n\n5. Unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block to hold the red block in hand, which makes the yellow block clear.\n\n6. Stack the red block back onto the blue block. Now, the red block is at the top of the newly formed stack of blocks: red on blue on orange. The hand is empty after this action.\n\n7. Finally, pick up the yellow block from the table. This leaves the yellow block in hand, satisfying the final condition.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red blue)\n(stack red yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(stack red blue)\n(pick-up yellow)",

        "answer": "Starting with the stated initial conditions, you have a sequence of actions to reach the desired goal. Your goal is to ensure that the red block is clear, the orange block is clear, that you are holding the yellow block, that the red block remains on top of the blue block, and that both the blue block and the orange block remain on the table.\n\nTo achieve this, you can follow a plan that involves some specific steps. First, observe the initial setup: the yellow block is positioned on top of the red block, which itself is situated on top of the blue block. The first action is to unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block. This will leave the yellow block in your hand. With the yellow block in your hand, the red block will then become clear, meeting one of the goal conditions. Since the hand is indeed now holding the yellow block, you have successfully fulfilled all the desired conditions stated in your goal.\n\nBy following these steps, you ensure each condition of the target configuration is achieved correctly.

        "answer": "Based on the initial conditions and the actions allowed, you're starting with the blue block clear and on top of the yellow block; the red and orange blocks are on the table and clear, with your hand empty. Your objective is to have the red block sitting on the yellow block and the blue block sitting on the red block at the end. Here's the step-by-step plan to achieve your goal:\n\nFirstly, you unstack the blue block from the yellow block, which means you simply lift the blue block off the yellow one since it is already clear. This action leaves the blue block in your hand and the yellow block clear.\n\nNext, you stack the blue block on top of the orange block. Since you were holding the blue block from the previous step and the orange block is clear on the table, this action is possible.\n\nThen, you pick up the red block because it is currently clear and on the table, with your hand now empty. This means you grasp the red block, preparing it for the next action.\n\nNow, with the red block in hand, you stack it on the yellow block. Both conditions, holding the block and the yellow block being clear, are satisfied. The red block is now on the yellow block.\n\nLastly, you unstack the blue block from the orange block and place it on top of the red block. First, you pick up the blue block from the orange block, which is possible since the blue block is clear.

The goal is to rearrange the blocks so that the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the red block, and both the yellow block and the red block are on the table.\n\nThe plan involves a series of actions following the restrictions provided. We start by unstacking the red block that is currently on top of the blue block since it is clear and we have an empty hand. After unstacking, we put the red block down on the table. Then, we unstack the blue block from the orange block and put it down on the table as well. Next, we unstack the orange block from the yellow block, and then we stack the orange block on top of the red block, as the red block is already on the table and clear. We then pick up the blue block and stack it on top of the orange block, forming part of the desired arrangement. The final steps of the complete plan should ensure that the blue block ends up on top of the orange block, which is on top of the red block, and the yellow and red blocks are positioned on the table.

Afterward, we will unstack the red block from on top of the orange block, and finally, place the red block down on the table as well. These steps ensure that each block is clear and placed on the table, and the hand is empty by the end.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack yellow blue)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)",

Initially, you have the blue block clear and on top of the orange block, the orange block on top of the red block, with both the yellow block and red block on the table, and your hand is empty. The goal is to have the blue block on top of the yellow block, with the orange block on top of the red block, ensuring both the blue and orange blocks are clear, and the hand is empty. To achieve this, you first unstack the blue block from the orange block, then stack the blue block onto the yellow block, ensuring that each action follows the required conditions.

The blue block is on the table, and your hand is empty. The goal is to achieve a new specific configuration: the red, blue, and orange blocks should all be clear, and your hand should hold the yellow block. Additionally, the red, blue, and orange blocks should all be on the table.\n\nHere's how you can achieve the goal with a series of actions:\n\n1. Unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block. This makes the red block clear and allows you to pick it up, keeping your hand empty initially.\n2. Put down the red block on the table. This action makes the red block clear and on the table.\n3. Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block. Now the yellow block is clear, and you can hold it.\n4. Stack the yellow block back on top of the red block. This action temporarily holds the yellow block on top of the red block.\n5. Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block. The orange block is now in your hand.\n6. Put down the orange block on the table. The orange block becomes clear.\n7. Unstack the yellow block again from on top of the red block.

This action creates a scenario where the blue block is now being held by the hand. The orange block becomes clear with this action.\n\n2. **Put down the blue block**: Placing the blue block on the table clears your hand and meets one of the goal conditions, where the blue block should be clear and on the table.\n\n3. **Unstack the orange block from the red block**: With the hand empty again after putting down the blue block, you can now unstack the orange block from the red block. This action leads to the final condition needed for the goal, as you're now holding the orange block.\n\nBy following these actions in sequence, you meet all the specified goal conditions while adhering to the provided action rules and restrictions.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack orange red)",

Initially, the orange block is sitting on top of the blue block, which has the red, blue, and yellow blocks clear and separate on the table. The hand is also empty.\n\n1. Start by removing the obstacle. First, unstack the orange block that is resting on top of the blue block, since the blue block needs to be used in our target stacking.\n2. Once the orange block is unstacked, place it onto the table, ensuring the hand is free for further actions.\n3. With the orange block no longer a hindrance, pick up the blue block, which is now clear and not supporting any other block.\n4. Stack the blue block neatly on top of the red block already positioned on the table. This begins forming the intended stack.\n5. You can now leave the rest (yellow and orange on table) since the task was mainly to ensure blue is on red.\n\nProceeding with these steps allows the blue block to be accurately positioned over the red block, with the orange block on the table.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack orange blue)  \n(put-down orange)  \n(pick-up blue)  \n(stack blue red)",
