        "question": "Given the question: One afternoon, a pilot was flying a small airplane when it suddenly ran out of gas. As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is\n\nand the options:\nA: admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.\nB: admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.\nC: inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\nD: inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.\n\nWhat is the answer?\n\nPlease inference first, then provide the final answer (A/B/C/D) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",

Since the father did not retain the consulting attorney and the intent of the meeting was not for obtaining legal representation, the privilege is not automatically applied here. However, the essence of attorney-client privilege is to maintain confidentiality, and the presence of the father does not necessarily negate this privilege, especially considering that the father and the minor are co-representing interests in this situation.

        "question": "Given the question: For many years, persons engaged in real estate transactions in a state have utilized installment land contracts. The so-called installment land contract has been popular as a substitute for the mortgage or deed of trust. Under such a contract, the seller agrees to accept, and the buyer agrees to pay, the purchase price in installments over a stipulated period of time. The vendor retains legal title as security for the payment of the purchase price; and the vendee has equitable title under the doctrine of equitable conversion. The most important characteristic of the installment land contract, however, is the forfeiture clause, which provides that if the vendee is in default for 30 days, the vendor may, at his option, declare a forfeiture of the contract, in which case all payments made shall be forfeited as \"liquidated\" damages and the buyer shall become a tenant at will of the seller. Over the years, many sellers of property under such installment land contracts have declared forfeitures in situations where the prospective buyers were delinquent in their payments, even when the buyer was late with a single payment after nearly all the other payments had been made. In order to remedy this inequitable situation, the state legislature enacted a statute requiring any seller attempting to declare a forfeiture of an installment land contract to do so by instituting a formal foreclosure action in the courts. The new law also provided that prior to the commencement of such a foreclosure action, the seller under such an arrangement must give the buyer a 60-day grace period to make up any delinquent installment payment with interest. The new law expressly applied both to installment land contracts entered into subsequent to its enactment and to installment land contracts already in existence at the time of its enactment. Is this new state statute likely to be held constitutional?\n\nand the options:\nA: Yes, because it is a reasonable regulation of the procedure to be followed in such cases and does not substantially diminish the underlying obligations of the buyer.\nB: Yes, because the authority to enact laws regulating real estate sales transactions occurring within the boundaries of individual states is reserved exclusively to the states by the Tenth Amendment.\nC: No, because application of the law to installment land contracts entered into prior to its enactment is a violation of the obligation of contracts.\nD: No, because application of the law to installment land contracts entered into before or after its enactment is a deprivation of a proprietary interest without due process of the law.\n\nWhat is the answer?\n\nPlease inference first, then provide the final answer (A/B/C/D) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",

Last year, the city amended its employee benefit plan to deny its death benefit in cases where the death \"was caused by the employee's refusal to accept, for any reason other than its excessive risk to life or health, reasonably available medical care prescribed by a physician.\" After this amendment took effect, the officer was shot while on duty. Because of a sincerely held religious belief, the officer refused to allow a prescribed blood transfusion and, as a result, died from loss of blood. When the officer's spouse applied for the death benefit, the city denied the application on the basis of the amendment to the employee benefit plan. The officer's spouse has challenged the amendment, claiming that, as applied to the officer, it violated the officer's constitutional right to the free exercise of religion. Is the court likely to find the amendment to the employee benefit plan constitutional as applied to the officer?\n\nand the options:\nA: No, because it effectively discriminates against a religious practice.\nB: No, because it violates the vested contractual rights of city employees who were hired before the amendment took effect.\nC: Yes, because it does not single out religious reasons for the denial of benefits and is a reasonable limitation on the award of such benefits.\nD: Yes, because it imposes a condition only on the award of a government benefit and does not impose a penalty on an individual's conduct.\n\nWhat is the answer?\n\nPlease inference first, then provide the final answer (A/B/C/D) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",

The mushrooms on the farmer's farm were usually picked and packaged by the farmer's three sons. On February 27, two of the Sons were injured in a fanning accident and hospitalized. As a result, the farmer encountered a manpower shortage and could not process all of the mushrooms for the chef's order. On February 28, the farmer telephoned the chef and said, \"Because my two sons were injured yesterday, I won't be able to deliver your mushrooms on March 1. However, I am trying to hire some other farm hands to help process your order. Although I can't promise it, I should be able to deliver the mushrooms by the end of the week. \" The chef, who knew that the fanner's sons were responsible for the mushroom farming, said, \"No problem.

        "question": "Given the question: The owner of a large unimproved tract of land leased it to a tenant for five years at a monthly rental of $1,500. The rental agreement provided that the land was to be used as farmland. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the tract of land, he built thereon, at his own expense, a barn made of lumber, which was 15 feet wide, 20 feet long, and set on loose bricks. The barn increased the appraised market value of the tract of land from $250,000 to $275,000. The tenant then began farming operations on the land. Toward the end of the lease period, the owner informed the tenant that he was going to put the tract of land up for sale. The next month, when the lease expired, the parties settled a dispute over the tenant's right, if any, to compensation for the improvements by the following written agreement:\"On the sale of the tract of land, the owner hereby agrees to pay the tenant two-thirds of any sale proceeds in excess of $250,000, provided that tenant may remain on the farm for the next year, rent-free, while the owner tries to sell it. After that time, the tenant may remain on the land until closing of the sale, at a monthly rental of $1,000. \"The owner initially set the asking price at $300,000. After receiving scant interest, the owner decided to reduce the price to $260,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the farm to all of the prospective buyers. Finally, 14 months after the agreement between the owner and the tenant was executed, and after rejecting offers for $240,000 and $250,000, the owner sold the tract of land for $256,000 to a buyer who visited the land while the tenant was away on vacation. Thereupon, the tenant, who had failed to pay the last two months rent as per the agreement, moved out. After closing, the owner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds, and the tenant brought suit to recover damages for breach of contract. Which of the following is the owner's most persuasive argument in defense of the tenant's suit?\n\nand the options:\nA: The tenant committed an uncured material breach of an implied promise to cooperate in the owner's efforts to sell the property, or at least not to hinder the proposed sale.\nB: The tenant's negative comments about the farm to prospective buyers amounted to an anticipatory repudiation of the agreement between the owner and the tenant.\nC: The tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract that discharged the owner's remaining duties of performance.\nD: The agreement between the owner and the tenant was voidable because it was a restraint on alienation, since it conditioned a promise to pay for a conveyance of land upon an otherwise invalid leasehold contract.\n\nWhat is the answer?\n\nPlease inference first, then provide the final answer (A/B/C/D) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",

It authorizes the president of either country to issue a proclamation nullifying any state or local laws in that country that have the effect of impeding imports from the other country. The foreign country uses the metric system of measurement, and thus all goods produced there and exported to the United States are packaged in metric sizes, such as liters and kilograms. A law of a state in the United States requires all goods sold in that state to be packaged in traditional American sizes, such as quarts or pounds. Because the state law substantially impedes imports from the foreign country, the President of the United States has issued a proclamation nullifying the state law pursuant to the treaty. Is the President's proclamation valid?\n\nand the options:\nA: No, because the Constitution vests in Congress the exclusive authority to specify binding legal standards for weights and measures, and the President therefore lacks constitutional authority for the proclamation.\nB: No, because the principles of federalism embedded in the Constitution prohibit the President from taking action to invalidate a state law.\nC: Yes, because it is authorized by a valid treaty of the United States and is not prohibited by any provision of the Constitution and, therefore, is the supreme law of the land.\nD: Yes, because the President has inherent authority to nullify any state law that substantially impedes commerce between substantially impedes commerce between the United States and another country.\n\nWhat is the answer?\n\nPlease inference first, then provide the final answer (A/B/C/D) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",

Apparently, the casino hired the new manager to get rid of some of the old-time employees and replace them with new personnel at a lower wage. Angered by their firing, the codefendants vowed to get back at the casino. As their revenge, they decided to plant a bomb in the casino and demand $1,000,000. After receiving the money, they would then reveal the location of the bomb and provide details for defusing it. The co-defendants agreed that the casino should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, one of the co-defendants, who was an electronics expert, built the bomb himself. He alone then drove to the casino where he placed the bomb in a hallway closet. Shortly thereafter, the other co-defendant phoned the casino and made a demand for the money. He said a bomb was in the casino and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The casino treated their demand as a crank call and refused to make any payment. With their plans having gone awry, the codefendants agreed that one of them should return to the casino and defuse the bomb. As one of the co-defendants was driving back to the casino, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. A subsequent investigation revealed that a faulty wire caused the bomb to detonate prematurely.

Wishing to avoid a lawsuit, the buyer assigned the contract (which the contract did not forbid) in an arm's-length transaction to an investor, who is experienced in buying and selling real estate.

The investor has sued the owner for specific performance. Who will likely prevail?\n\nand the options:\nA: The investor, because an assignee of the original party purchaser in a real estate contract is entitled to specific performance under these circumstances.\nB: The investor, because she has elected to waive the owner's lack of marketable title caused by the zoning change.\nC: The owner, because the investor is not a bona fide assignee without notice, and thus does not have clean hands.\nD: The owner, because the investor, who is experienced in buying and selling real estate, is entitled to money damages but not to specific performance.\n\nWhat is the answer?\n\nPlease inference first, then provide the final answer (A/B/C/D) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",

A woman was arrested and charged with murder. She pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. At her first trial, the state introduced evidence showing that the woman was having an affair with the victim.

During the public debate on the proposal, a middle school teacher had published two \"letters to the editor\" criticizing the \"duplicitous\" practices of certain school board members in using \"backroom politics\" to try and get the vote approved. He doubted the need for new expenditures and criticized the superintendent of schools for trying to influence teachers on the issue. After the bond issue passed, the school district brought internal charges against the teacher, and after a hearing he was fired.

One of its biggest assets is the excellent fishing and boating, which is available to the public at large. Three years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of the lake, the county leased a sizable portion of the lake and surrounding parkland to a company owned by the most prominent family in the county. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate yacht house and club, complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina, and to pay the county 10% of its net profits as rent. The company set up bylaws, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. According to the bylaws, the yacht club, complete with its restaurant and bar, would be open to members only, and the membership committee was empowered to set up strict membership \"standards,\" as well as the cost of membership fees and dues. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar.

Since no compelling interest or important basis for the exclusion of women from membership is evident, the company's policy likely fails to pass intermediate scrutiny, and the plaintiff's claim of discrimination would succeed. \n\nFinal Answer: D",

        "question": "Given the question: A state election code provides that any political organization whose candidate received 20% or more of the vote at the most recent gubernatorial or presidential election is a political party; other political organizations are construed as political bodies. Political parties conduct primaries, and the winning candidates in each office may have their names placed on the ballot. However, nominees of political bodies or any independent candidate may only have their names placed on the ballot if they file a nominating petition signed by not less than 7% of those eligible to vote at the last election for the offices that they are seeking. The time for circulating the petition is 180 days, which is also the deadline governing party candidates in party primaries. An independent candidate, who desires to be listed on the ballot for the office of governor, challenges the constitutionality of this election law. The court will most likely declare this statute\n\nand the options:\nA: unconstitutional, because it is a violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments' rights of free speech.\nB: unconstitutional, because it is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\nC: unconstitutional, because it violates the Fifteenth Amendment's voting provisions.\nD: constitutional, because the election code is nonviolative of the equal protection clause.\n\nWhat is the answer?\n\nPlease inference first, then provide the final answer (A/B/C/D) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",

A lawyer drove her car to the downtown area to go to a meeting with a client. She was running late for the meeting and could not find a legal parking spot, so she decided to park illegally in front of a fire hydrant. This was in violation of a local ordinance that prohibited parking within 50 feet of a fire hydrant. The lawyer figured that it was better to get a ticket than to miss her meeting with an important client. The spot where she parked was next to the site of the construction of the new building. While the lawyer was at her meeting, an accident occurred at the construction site. A large crane was being used to lift a load of bricks. A cable on the crane broke, and the bricks fell. Most of them landed on top of the lawyer's car. The load of bricks that fell on the lawyer's car caused the gas tank of the car to rupture and explode.

When she arrived, the graduate was told that her job was contingent on passing the state bar examination, which was being offered in July. In preparing for the bar examination, the graduate planned to take a bar review course. Although she had not pre-enrolled, the graduate planned to attend and pay for the course at registration. On the morning the course was set to begin, the graduate arrived late after getting stuck in freeway traffic. By the time the graduate got to the course location, registration had already been completed. When the graduate looked into the room where the course was being conducted, she saw the lecture had begun, and everyone was inside busily taking notes. Panicky, the graduate picked up a set of course materials that were lying on the registration table and entered without paying. Although the graduate intended to pay the enrollment fee, no one was at the registration table to take her money. After attending the first couple of classes, the graduate sent a cashier's check for the full amount of the enrollment fee to the bar review company. Unbeknownst to the graduate, the bar review course's regional director noticed that she had entered the lectures without paying. After ascertaining her identity from a fellow student who knew the graduate, the company filed a complaint with the local prosecutor, and a warrant was issued for her arrest. The complaint charged the graduate with the crime of larceny by trick, for deliberately failing to pay for services rendered. After the complaint was issued, the graduate's check arrived at the company's office. The company deposited the check but failed to inform the prosecutor that payment had been received. The graduate was arrested and held in custody overnight before the matter was resolved. The graduate suffered severe emotional distress at the publicity she received in the local newspapers and the humiliation she suffered for being arrested and held in police custody.

The bill passed the state legislature at the urging of state and local law enforcement agencies who argued that tinted windows prevented them from observing interior car activity. Most citizens also supported the bill, especially after a state trooper was killed by an occupant in a window-tinted limousine. The trooper was unable to see that his assailant was armed and dangerous when he approached the vehicle for a speeding infraction. A limousine company operates a limo service in a neighboring state and has a fleet of 68 limos, all of which have tinted windows. Each year, the company makes thousands of trips into the state to transport passengers to the international airport situated 10 miles from the border separating the two states. Since all of its limos are manufactured with tinted windows, the company will incur great expense in ordering limos without tinting. The company brings suit to challenge the constitutionality of the state statute. Assuming that the company has proper standing to assert such an action, which of the following is their strongest constitutional argument to invalidate the aforesaid statute?\n\nand the options:\nA: Because window tinting is permitted on vehicles in neighboring states, this law denies the company the equal protection of laws.\nB: Because this law burdens interstate commerce by prohibiting all vehicles with window tinting from entering the state, this law violates the commerce clause.\nC: Because window tinting on vehicles is legal in their home state, this law violates the contract clause by preventing the company from fulfilling its obligation to transport passengers into a neighboring state.\nD: Because interstate travel is a fundamental right that may not be burdened by state law, it violates the company's substantive due process rights by arbitrarily and unreasonably regulating economic activity.\n\nWhat is the answer?\n\nPlease inference first, then provide the final answer (A/B/C/D) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",

A state trooper is a member of the state police force, a law enforcement body that exercises broad police authority throughout the state. The position of state trooper is filled on the basis of competitive examinations taken by all of the applicants. After the resident alien applied for the position, the state authorities refused him permission to take the qualifying examination. The state authorities based their refusal on state statute, which provided:\"No person shall become a member of the state police unless he/she shall be a citizen of the United States. \"Thus, under this provision, as a prerequisite to becoming a member of the state police, an alien must relinquish his foreign citizenship and become a citizen. In an opinion upholding the validity of the statute, the State Attorney General noted that since police officers fall within the category of important non-elective officials who participate directly in the execution of broad public policy, only citizens of the United States should be qualified to apply for such positions. \"At the time the resident alien applied for a position as a state trooper, he was a citizen of a foreign country and not currently eligible for citizenship. As a result of a federal statute, Congress has imposed a five-year residency requirement for the attainment of citizenship. Under this federal law, an alien must reside in this country for a period of five years as a prerequisite before applying for citizenship. At this time, the resident alien had only lawfully been residing in the United States for two years, and thus would not be eligible to apply for naturalization until three years later.

In recent years, many outside organizations have entered the fairgrounds and distributed literature and paraphernalia to the many thousands of patrons visiting the fair. State fair officials did not endorse any of these organizations but permitted them to disseminate their materials throughout the fairgrounds without charge. Lately, however, many families attending the fair have complained about being harassed by canvassers from these various organizations. In an effort to protect the safety and welfare of the persons visiting the fair, the state legislature enacted a law prohibiting anyone from selling or distributing materials at the state fair. This new statute provided, however, that groups could pay a $50 license fee and distribute their literature from enclosed booths. These booths would be set up along the entrance to the fairgrounds and rented to anyone wishing to sell or distribute materials or soliciting money during the fair. The first year that the statute went into effect, approximately 40 groups rented booth space. There were various organizations paying the $50 license fee. A group of scientists opposed to the use of aerosol spray cans, requested permission to distribute literature at the fairgrounds. The scientists claimed that they simply wanted to warn people of the perils created by the disintegration of the ozone layer from the dispersion of fluorocarbons into the atmosphere. State fair officials offered to lease the scientists a booth at the $50 fee, but refused to permit solicitation activities outside the booth enclosures. The scientists were unwilling to pay the $50 license fee and instituted suit in state court seeking a court order permitting them to distribute literature anywhere in the fairgrounds area.

        "question": "Given the question: A rancher is the owner of a ranch situated upon the top of a mountain. Located below the ranch is a 40-acre farm that is owned by a farmer. There is a stream, which is a non-navigable watercourse, that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into the valley below. Both the ranch and the farm are within the watershed of the stream. When the farmer purchased the farm in 1974, he began taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1974, the southern half of the farm had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and unused except for an occasional hike or gathering of timber for use as domestic fuel. The farmer continued this established pattern of use. Now (January 2010), he is still taking water from the stream and using it to irrigate the southern half of the farm. In 2008, the rancher built a home on the ranch and began taking water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. The next year, however, there was a drought. As a result, the stream flowed at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the farmer's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one quarter of the farmer's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. Inasmuch as the stream is still flowing at a very low level and the rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs, there is insufficient water to irrigate the farm. As a consequence, the farmer brings an appropriate action to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher. In addition, the farmer moves to have the full flow of the stream passed to him, notwithstanding the effect it might have on the rancher. If this state follows the doctrine of prior appropriation, judgment should be for whom?\n\nand the options:\nA: The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner.\nB: The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and protected against an agricultural use.\nC: The farmer, because he has obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need.\nD: The farmer, because he has put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.\n\nWhat is the answer?\n\nPlease inference first, then provide the final answer (A/B/C/D) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",

The farmer's continuous irrigation of the farm since 1974 establishes his prior and beneficial use of the water.

The parties then entered into a written contract to have the car serviced for $1,000. As the woman remembers it, at the time the written contract was formed, the parties orally agreed that if the car required any additional servicing above that detailed in the contract, it would be included in the $1,000 fee. The mechanic, however, has no recollection of any such oral agreement. While servicing the car, the mechanic discovered that a belt was severel' worn and need to be replaced. The belt replacement was not listed as work to be performed in the written contract. The mechanic telephoned the woman and told her he had found the worn belt and felt he should replace it. The woman told him to do so.

        "question": "Given the question: An avid baseball fan learned that a local professional baseball club was conducting a baseball camp for fans who wanted to meet and receive instruction from the club's players. The cost of the two-week camp was advertised for $2,500, which included meals and housing. The fan, a 54-year-old salesman, forwarded the club a $50 registration deposit, which reserved him a spot in the baseball camp. Thereafter, the fan received a contract from the club, which all baseball camp attendees were required to sign. The agreement provided that the $2,500 entrance fee was nonrefundable. According to the agreement, all attendees would receive group instruction during the baseball camp. Consequently, the club's operating costs would not be reduced if one or more of the attendees failed to participate or complete the two-week program. The fan signed the contract and forwarded it with his $2,500 entrance fee to the club. Two days before the start of the baseball camp, however, the fan died from a heart attack. In a restitutionary action, can the executor of the fan's estate, a surviving brother, recover on behalf of the estate either all or part of the $2,500 paid to the club?\n\nand the options:\nA: No, but only if the club can show that before the start of the baseball camp it rejected another applicant because of its commitment to the fan.\nB: No, because under the terms of the agreement the $2,500 entrance fee was nonrefundable.\nC: Yes, because the club would otherwise be unjustly enriched at the fan's expense.\nD: Yes, under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.\n\nWhat is the answer?\n\nPlease inference first, then provide the final answer (A/B/C/D) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",

This was the first action taken, and the creditor did not have a judgment. It served the notice of garnishment on the garnishee, the woman's employer.

The contractor decided to submit a bid to do the construction. The contractor contacted all of the subcontractors she had worked with in the past, informed them of the specifics of the school construction project, and asked each to submit a bid for the work they would be requested to perform. An insulation company submitted a bid of $25,000 to do the required insulation work in the new school. Based on that and other subcontract bids, the contractor prepared a general bid and submitted it to the city. Three days after the contractor submitted the bid to the city, the insulation company notified the contractor that it had overbooked its workforce and would be unable to perform the insulation work. The next day, the city notified the contractor that she had won the bid to build the school. The contractor was forced to find another company to do the insulation work.

        "answer": "In a race-notice jurisdiction, a purchaser must both record first and have no notice of any prior unrecorded claims to win title. The first purchaser failed to record her deed, so when the second purchaser bought the property and recorded his deed first, he had priority. However, the second purchaser may have had constructive notice due to the tax lien certificate indicating a different party was paying taxes. This suggests a need to further investigate who was in possession.

When the residential subdivision was first plotted, the developer constructed a private road along (and including) the western boundary of the subdivision. This private road was used only for the benefit of the owners who purchased lots in the subdivision. A homeowner owned a 20-acre tract immediately outside of the residential subdivision, which was situated just below the public highway and immediately adjacent to the west side of the private road. The homeowner's property was divided into two 10-acre parcels: Parcel 1 was the northern half and bordered along the public highway; Parcel 2 was the southern sector and abutted a river.

In an appropriate action by the librarian to enjoin the teacher from using the existing easement to gain access to the farm, the plaintiff will most likely\n\nand the options:\nA: succeed, because the teacher is making use of the servient tenement beyond the scope and extent of the easement as it was originally created.\nB: succeed, because the teacher has no right to use the servient tenement in connection with a tract of land that is not part of the dominant tenement.\nC: not succeed, because the teacher has an easement by necessity.\nD: not succeed, because the teacher has a right to use the easement in a manner not inconsistent with the rights of the owner of the servient tenement.\n\nWhat is the answer?\n\nPlease inference first, then provide the final answer (A/B/C/D) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",

Whoever sells intoxicating liquor to any person who is intoxicated or inebriated is guilty of a misdemeanor. This section shall not apply in the case of sales of intoxicating liquor by a hotel, motel, or inn to any person registered and resident as a guest in such hotel, motel, or inn for consumption upon the premises thereof. \"\"Section 1213. It shall be unlawful for any vendor with a valid state liquor license to sell intoxicating beverages on Sunday. Anyone in violation of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not less than $100 or more than $1,000. \"The state authorities have regularly enforced the aforementioned dram shop statute and \"blue law\" prohibiting Sunday liquor sales. At 12:30 a. m. on Sunday morning, a customer entered a liquor store and purchased a bottle of wine. The clerk who made the sale, thought the time was 11:30 p. m. Saturday night because that was the time shown on the store's wall clock. Unknown to the clerk, the clock was malfunctioning and was running an hour behind. Thus, the clock displayed the wrong time when the clerk sold the wine to the customer. When the clerk made the sale, the customer did not appear to be visibly inebriated. After making the purchase, the customer drank the entire bottle of wine. He then drove off in his car and struck a pedestrian, injuring him. At the time of the accident, the customer was intoxicated from drinking the wine.

A taxi driver who happened to be crossing the bridge at that moment saw what the stockbroker was doing. The taxi driver slammed on his brakes, jumped out of his taxi, started running toward the stockbroker, and yelled, \"Don't do it!\" Pleased to hear that someone cared about him, the stockbroker changed his mind about committing suicide and decided that he wanted to live. At that moment, however, the stockbroker started to lose his balance, and his feet began to slip off the small, grimy ledge of the bridge. Just as the stockbroker started to fall, the taxi driver reached him and grabbed the back of his jacket.

Pursuant to that law, a woman sued a local newspaper in state court after the newspaper identified her as a rape victim. The state trial and appellate courts rejected the claim, holding that the state law was invalid under both the state constitution and the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The state supreme court affirmed, holding specifically: \"We think that this well-intentioned law very likely violates the First Amendment of the federal Constitution.

A subsequent investigation revealed that the explosion was caused by a defective gas tank that had ruptured. This produced a gasoline leak that was ignited by sparks from the car's underbody. A reasonable inspection would have disclosed the defective gas tank. The trouble the buyer had described to the service manager was indicative of such a problem. If the buyer asserts a claim against the manufacturer of the convertible for damages for his injuries, will the buyer prevail?\n\nand the options:\nA: Yes, if the dealership should have replaced the gas tank.\nB: Yes, because the buyer's injury was caused by the defective gas tank.\nC: No, if the buyer should have realized the gasoline smell presented a hazardous condition and stopped the car before the explosion occurred.\nD: No, unless the gas tank was defective when the car left the manufacturer's plant.\n\nWhat is the answer?\n\nPlease inference first, then provide the final answer (A/B/C/D) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",

A railroad worker, who happened to be standing next to the train, decided to be helpful. He said, \"You can make it,\" and gave the man a shove toward the open door of the train. The man stumbled and dropped the box that he was carrying. Instantly, the box made a loud screeching noise. The box contained powerful fireworks, and the impact of the box hitting the ground had caused a large rocket to ignite. The rocket flew out of the box and shot across the train station, glancing off the ceiling and finally crashing into a wall of a small coffee shop on the far side of the train station, about 150 feet from the train.

The seller delivered the system on June 1, but the buyer refused to pay more than $100,000, citing the earlier oral agreement as to price. The seller sued the buyer for the additional $10,000 under the written agreement. Is the court likely to admit the evidence of the orally agreed price of $100,000?\n\nand the options:\nA: No, because the buyer assumed the risk of any mistake as to price.\nB: No, because the oral price term would contradict an express term in the written agreement.\nC: Yes, because the oral price term is relevant to whether the writing should be reformed.\nD: Yes, because the written agreement did not contain a merger clause.\n\nWhat is the answer?\n\nPlease inference first, then provide the final answer (A/B/C/D) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",

        "question": "Given the question: Over the last several years, the economy of a state has substantially changed. The state's economy used to be based solely on heavy industry. However, the state legislature approved legalized gambling within the state. As a consequence, many casinos and new hotels were built and the state's economy boomed. These moves were often induced by the granting by the state of special tax benefits for the construction of new casinos and hotels under state statutes. Recently, however, neighboring states have legalized gambling and offered greater tax incentives to the gaming industry. As a result, many of the casino and hotel owners have begun to leave the state. The unemployment and social welfare benefits the state has had to pay have substantially increased, burdening the remaining casinos, and also making it difficult for the state to lower its taxes to remain competitive with other states. On account of this predicament, the state legislature passed, and the governor duly signed, an emergency bill into law. According to the statute, the state imposed a one cent tax on the playing of any slot machine in any gambling casino. Since virtually all the slot machines required a payment of either a dime, quarter, or dollar, the imposition of this tax required a major costly adaptation on each slot machine to allow for the deposit of the additional one cent tax. Although many casino owners have complained about the tax, their only alternative is to absorb the tax themselves and lose one cent per game. As a consequence of the tax, fewer slot machines are purchased in the state by the casino owners. No manufacturer of slot machines is located in the state. Which of the following constitutional provisions provide the strongest ground to attack the validity of the state tax bill?\n\nand the options:\nA: The commerce clause.\nB: The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC: The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD: The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2.\n\nWhat is the answer?\n\nPlease inference first, then provide the final answer (A/B/C/D) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",

One evening, the student and a few of his rugby teammates were drinking beer at a local pub.

While the student was discussing the problem with his teammates, the owner of the tavern approached the players.

The mortgage was dated January 1, 2008, and was recorded January 2, 2008. Thereafter, on February 1, 2008, the man executed a deed absolute on the apartment building and named the friend as grantee. This deed, although absolute in form, was intended only as additional security for the payment of the debt. In order to make judicial foreclosure unnecessary and to eliminate the right to redeem, the man then delivered the deed to an escrow agent in escrow with instructions to deliver the deed to the friend if the man failed to pay his promissory note at maturity. On January 1, 2009, the man failed to pay the note when it came due. The next day, the escrow agent delivered the deed to the apartment building to the friend.

Consequently, the fan telephoned his next-door neighbor and asked him if he would be interested in going to the stadium to purchase the baseball tickets. The neighbor told the fan that he would be happy to purchase the tickets for him and that he (the neighbor) also wanted to buy tickets for himself. However, the neighbor said that his car had broken down and that he did not have available transportation to get to the stadium. The fan suggested that he could lend his car to the neighbor. The neighbor agreed, and the following morning the two men met in front of the fan's home. The fan gave the neighbor the keys to his car and also money with which to buy his baseball tickets. Thereafter, the neighbor drove the fan's car to the stadium where he purchased the tickets for the fan and (using his own money) also bought a set of tickets for himself. The fan had instructed the neighbor to return the car to the fan's home after his trip to the stadium.

The purpose of the statute was to protect children from accessing pornographic materials. The law imposed a blanket prohibition on any communications that could be accessed by children and which might contain the feared material. A group of Internet publishers filed an action to have the law declared unconstitutional and unenforceable. They proved that many instances of artistic expression and non-prurient broadcasts could fall within the wide parameters of the law.

The man died a widower in 1990, devising all of his real property to his son. The will was duly probated shortly thereafter. In 2005, the son conveyed the tract of land to a friend. This deed was not recorded until after the son's death in 2009. The son's will, duly probated following his death, named the friend as sole legatee and devisee of the son's entire estate. In 2008, the son mortgaged the tract of land to the bank. The mortgage instrument, which was recorded in 2008, recited that it was subordinate to a mortgage on the same land given by the son to a rancher in 1988 and recorded in 1988. In that instrument, the son purported to grant the rancher a mortgage on the tract of land. All of the deeds mentioned in the aforementioned transactions are general warranty deeds. In addition, the State of Baden has a notice-type recording statute and follows a title theory for mortgages. What is the probable legal effect of the son's mortgage agreement in 2008 with the bank?\n\nand the options:\nA: The mortgage would be invalid, because the son conveyed his interest in the property to the friend in 2005.\nB: The mortgage would be invalid, because the first mortgage in 1988 would take precedence over the second mortgage.\nC: The mortgage would be invalid, unless the mortgagee bank had knowledge of the prior conveyance to the friend.\nD: The subsequent mortgagee, the bank, would prevail as against the prior conveyee (the friend), who failed to record before the mortgage was effectuated.\n\nWhat is the answer?\n\nPlease inference first, then provide the final answer (A/B/C/D) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",

        "question": "Given the question: An actress went to a plastic surgeon for removal of an abnormal growth on her right cheek. Under a written contract, the plastic surgeon agreed to surgically remove the growth for $1,000. As the actress subsequently recalled, just before signing the agreement the parties orally agreed that if any additional medical procedures were required during surgery, they would be included in the $1,000 fee. The plastic surgeon, however, has no recollection of any such oral agreement. As agreed, the surgery was performed on an outpatient basis at the plastic surgeon's office. She applied a localized anesthesia that enabled the actress to remain conscious during surgery. While the operation was being performed, the plastic surgeon noticed another growth on the actress's neck. As the plastic surgeon subsequently recalled, she informed the actress about the growth and recommended that it be removed as well. According to the plastic surgeon's account, the actress orally agreed to have the growth removed for an additional $500. The actress has no recollection of any such oral agreement. The plastic surgeon performed both removal procedures satisfactorily. Following the surgery, the actress paid the plastic surgeon $1,000, but refused to pay any additional money for the removal of the second growth. After unsuccessfully attempting to collect the $500, the plastic surgeon brought suit against the actress to recover the additional fee. At trial, the plastic surgeon objected to the introduction of testimony regarding any oral agreement made before the written contract was signed. By the same token, the actress objected to the introduction of testimony concerning any oral agreement made during surgery. Will the plastic surgeon be entitled to recover the additional $500 if both offerings of parol evidence are admitted and believed?\n\nand the options:\nA: No, because the oral agreements contradict each other; neither would be enforceable under the so-called knock-out rule.\nB: No, because in removing the growth from the actress's neck, the plastic surgeon performed a legal duty already owed her that was neither doubtful nor the subject of an honest dispute.\nC: Yes, because the oral modification of the prior writing was fair and equitable in view of circumstances not anticipated by the parties when the writing was executed.\nD: Yes, because the actress would be unjustly enriched by not paying the additional $500, and injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of her oral promise.\n\nWhat is the answer?\n\nPlease inference first, then provide the final answer (A/B/C/D) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",

The sales representative of the glass door company told the contractor and the owner that plate glass was \"super safe\" and could withstand considerable pressure. The contractor installed the door, completed the other renovation work, and the store reopened for business later that same month.

On September 6, 2008, the developer purchased a four-story office building in a nearby city. The building was in need of much renovation. To finance the improvements, the developer borrowed $250,000 from his friend. As consideration for the loan, the developer executed a promissory note for $250,000, payable to the friend in 10 years and secured by a mortgage on the office building. This mortgage was dated September 9, 2008 and recorded the following day. During the early part of 2009, the developer experienced serious financial setbacks and failed to make the monthly mortgage payments to the bank and the friend.

The land sale contract provided a closing date of November 19, 2007 and stipulated that \"time was of the essence. \"On July 2, 2007, a fire destroyed the antebellum mansion. The landowner had the mansion insured for $450,000 against fire loss and collected that amount from the insurance company. At the closing on November 19, the buyer tendered a cashier's check for $50,000 and demanded a deed conveying a fee simple interest in the property. Conversely, the landowner tendered a deed of conveyance and demanded the full purchase price of $500,000. The buyer refused the landowner's demand. In an appropriate action for specific performance against the buyer, the landowner demanded $500,000.

For some time the rancher's cattle had been seized upon by roaming packs of wolves. In order to protect his livestock from these attacks, the rancher erected a fence around his property. In addition, the rancher installed electrical wiring on the fence. The wiring transmitted an electric current, which would emit a shock upon contact with the fence. Although the voltage was calculated to frighten animals away from the fence, it was of such low intensity that it posed no risk of injury to a human being, even a small child. Consequently, the rancher did not post any notice of the electrical wiring device.

In order to make judicial foreclosure unnecessary and to eliminate the right to redeem, the investor then delivered the deed to his nephew in escrow with instructions to deliver the deed to the friend if the investor failed to pay his promissory note at maturity. On January 1 of the following year, the investor failed to pay the note when it came due. Thereupon, the nephew, in accordance with the escrow instructions, delivered the investor's deed on the office building to the friend, which the friend promptly and properly recorded. Two weeks later, the investor tendered the $125,000 indebtedness to the friend. When the friend refused to accept it, the investor brought an appropriate action to set aside and cancel the deed absolute and to permit the redemption of the building from the friend. Conversely, the friend counterclaimed to quiet title and argued that the deed absolute was intended as an outright conveyance upon default. The court should enter a judgment that will grant the relief sought by\n\nand the options:\nA: the investor, but only if the investor can establish that the mortgage takes precedence over the deed absolute because it was executed earlier in time.\nB: the investor, because the deed absolute did not extinguish his right of redemption.\nC: the friend, because the deed absolute effectuated an outright conveyance that extinguished the redemption interest sought to be retained by the investor.\nD: the friend, because the investor is estopped to deny the effect of the deed absolute in conjunction with the escrow arrangement.\n\nWhat is the answer?\n\nPlease inference first, then provide the final answer (A/B/C/D) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",

During the coach's first year as coach, the university basketball team compiled a record of 18 wins and 12 losses. The booster, however, refused to pay anything to either the coach or the university athletic fund. Assume that the agreement between the coach and the booster does not violate any rule of the university or of any intercollegiate athletic association. The university brought suit against the booster to recover $90,000 for breach of his promise to pay $5,000 into the athletic fund for each game won by the basketball team. Is it likely that the university will prevail in this contract action?\n\nand the options:\nA: Yes, because the university is an intended third-party beneficiary of the contract between the coach and the booster.\nB: Yes, because the university detrimentally relied on the booster's promise by hiring the coach.\nC: No, because the booster's promise was, in essence, an illegal form of procurement and void as against public policy.\nD: No, because the booster's promise was made to the coach rather than to the university and, therefore, was not a charitable subscription.\n\nWhat is the answer?\n\nPlease inference first, then provide the final answer (A/B/C/D) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",

However, the city council voted 7 to 3 against permitting the group from using the auditorium.

The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink in an appropriate space. A write-in candidate for the office of Attorney General is a Chinese-American. The candidate is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of Chinese voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered Chinese voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidates name along with the office of Attorney General. Since many native Chinese people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against the election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Thereafter, one of the candidate's opponents filed suit in state court seeking to prevent state election officials from counting any write-in ballots with stickers.

        "question": "Given the question: On Thanksgiving Day, a father was carving a turkey for his family when he seriously cut his hand. The knife severed an artery, causing the father to lose a lot of blood. The mother telephoned their family doctor, who instructed her to drive the father to the local hospital. The doctor indicated that he would meet them there. A short time later at the hospital, the doctor treated the father and bandaged his hand. However, due to the fact that the father had lost a considerable amount of blood, the doctor ordered an immediate blood transfusion. After determining that the father's blood type was A-positive, the doctor orally instructed a nurse, who was employed by the hospital, to obtain the necessary blood for the transfusion. The nurse followed the doctor's instructions and telephoned the hospital's blood bank department and ordered a unit of A-positive blood. The person in the blood bank who received the nurse's call correctly wrote down the order for A-positive blood. However, someone working at the blood bank, whose identity cannot be determined, made an error in filling the order and labeling the unit of blood for the father. As a result, the blood bank sent a unit of B-positive blood mislabeled as A-positive blood. After being administered the wrong blood, the father died. The hospital has a written rule in effect whereby all orders for blood transfusions must be made in writing by the physician in charge of the patient's treatment. Although the doctor was aware of the hospital rule, he, like many other doctors at the hospital, frequently ordered blood transfusions by oral instructions. If the mother asserts a wrongful death action against the doctor, she will most likely\n\nand the options:\nA: prevail, because the doctor would be responsible for the blood bank's error in administering the wrong blood.\nB: prevail, because the doctor did not follow the hospital's rule regarding blood transfusion orders.\nC: not prevail, because the doctor acted in the same fashion as many other doctors at the hospital.\nD: not prevail, because the unidentified person in the blood bank who was responsible for sending the wrong blood type was not an employee of the doctor.\n\nWhat is the answer?\n\nPlease inference first, then provide the final answer (A/B/C/D) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",

        "question": "Given the question: A defendant, an indigent, was arrested and charged with attempted murder. The defendant, who had a history of psychiatric problems, had been diagnosed as being paranoid schizophrenic. The defendant was represented by a court-appointed attorney. In trying to prepare for trial, the attorney met with the defendant on numerous occasions. The attorney, however, found it difficult to communicate with the defendant, who, due to his paranoia, distrusted the attorney and believed he was working with the prosecution to convict him. The defendant was subsequently convicted. After the defendant was sentenced, the attorney filed an appeal seeking to overturn the conviction and have a new trial ordered. The appeal, in part, challenged the constitutionality of a state statute that placed the burden of proof on the defendant by requiring him to prove mental incompetency by clear and convincing evidence. In addition, the appeal claimed that the attorney was unable to provide adequate representation because there was a failure of communication between the defendant and his attorney. The appeal will most likely be\n\nand the options:\nA: granted, because the prosecution has the burden to prove the defendant's competency by a preponderance of evidence.\nB: granted, because the defendant has the burden to prove mental incompetency by a preponderance of the evidence, not by clear and convincing evidence.\nC: denied, because it is constitutionally permissible to place the burden on the defendant to prove mental incompetency by clear and convincing evidence.\nD: denied, because the defendant cannot base an appeal on ineffective assistance of counsel due to his own failure to communicate with his lawyer.\n\nWhat is the answer?\n\nPlease inference first, then provide the final answer (A/B/C/D) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",

So don't vote for him. \" The other two pickets walked outside the rear of the district attorney's office building, carrying similar signs, telling the public not to vote for him. This picketing was carried on from 9 A. M. to 5 P. M. The same day, two more pickets were assigned to carry identical signs in front of the mayor's official residence. Two pickets also carried duplicate signs in front of the district attorney's suburban home during the early evening hours. The picketing at all sites was held peacefully without any disturbance.

As the man approached the rear of the woman's car, he became impatient and tried to pass her along a section of the highway designated as a no-passing zone. When the man swerved his car into the westbound lane to pass the woman, he didn't see another driver, who was rounding a curve in the westbound lane. In order to avoid a head-on collision with the man, the other driver swerved his car to the shoulder of the roadway. The other driver, however, was unable to control his car along the narrow strip of the shoulder, and it fell down the steep mountain.

The robberies were carried out by a single individual who entered the banks wearing a ski mask and carrying a machine gun. The police received information from a reliable informant that the defendant was the person responsible for the robberies. Acting on this tip, the police secured a valid arrest warrant and went to the defendant's home to apprehend him. When the officers rang the doorbell, the defendant opened the door and was placed under arrest. The defendant, who was wearing only underwear, asked the officers if he could put on a shirt and pants. One of the police officers asked the defendant if anyone else was present in the house. The defendant indicated that he was alone. The officer then accompanied the defendant to his bedroom to change his clothes. When the defendant asked permission to enter the closet for his pants, the officer told him that he needed to inspect the closet first. While the officer was inside the closet, he saw a ski mask that he recognized as part of the apparel worn by the bank robber. The officer confiscated the ski mask and then allowed the defendant inside the closet to change his clothes. While the officer and the defendant were in the bedroom, the officer's partner decided to conduct a protective sweep of the other rooms of the dwelling to see if any accomplices were present. Upon entering a back storage room, the other officer saw a box containing a large amount of $100 bills. The officer confiscated the money, which was later determined to be part of the money stolen during one of the bank robberies. The defendant is subsequently prosecuted for bank robbery.

        "question": "Given the question: During a three-month period, a city was stunned by a series of mysterious deaths, which claimed the lives of 20 people. Although all the victims had apparently died from poisoning, the police were in a quandary as to who was responsible for the killings. There was finally a breakthrough in the investigation when a police toxicologist determined that all the victims had died after eating poisoned apples which had been purchased at a local market. The apples had all been contaminated with a pesticide. The police then received a letter from a person who claimed responsibility for the poisonings. The letter stated that the killings were in retaliation for the city's new policy of prosecuting toxic polluters. Acting upon an anonymous tip, the police arrested the owner of a pest control company engaged in the manufacture of pesticides, and charged him with 20 counts of murder. Thereafter, the city's largest newspaper ran a series of articles on the killings and referred to the owner as the pesticide poisoner. After the preliminary hearing, the state trial judge issued an exparte injunction against the newspaper prohibiting it from publishing any news during the trial that might be prejudicial to the owner. The newspaper appealed. In light of the U. S. Supreme Court cases to date, the state appellate court should\n\nand the options:\nA: dissolve the injunction, because a news story about a matter of public interest is absolutely privileged.\nB: dissolve the injunction, because it is an impermissible prior restraint on the freedom of the press.\nC: uphold the injunction, because the inference of guilt in any prejudicial coverage would deny the defendant his constitutional right of a fair trial.\nD: uphold the injunction, because reference to the defendant by the name pesticide poisoner would be inflammatory and prejudicial.\n\nWhat is the answer?\n\nPlease inference first, then provide the final answer (A/B/C/D) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",

        "answer": "A news story about a matter of public interest can be considered absolutely privileged under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects freedom of the press. Prior restraint, or government actions that prevent speech or expression before they occur, is heavily scrutinized and often deemed unconstitutional. In this case, the injunction acts as a prior restraint, restricting the newspaper's ability to report on the trial. Given the strong constitutional protection for freedom of the press, the appellate court should dissolve the injunction, as it poses an impermissible restriction on that freedom.  \nFinal Answer: B",
        "gold_label": "A",
        "pred": "The question involves evaluating whether the injunction against the newspaper's publication during the trial violates the freedom of the press. The U.S. Supreme Court has established the principle that prior restraints on speech and publication are the most serious and least tolerable infringement on First Amendment rights. In the context of this case, an injunction prohibiting the newspaper from publishing news about the trial prior to its conclusion likely constitutes a prior restraint. The publication of information on a matter of public interest, such as a murder trial, generally holds special protection under the First Amendment, unless extraordinary circumstances justify the restriction, which is not evident here. Therefore, the injunction should be dissolved because it is an impermissible prior restraint on the freedom of the press.\n\nFinal Answer: B",

The Declaration of Covenants created the community association, as an administrative entity, to which the residential community lot owners would pay dues, and which would administer and enforce the regulations and restrictions recited among the covenants. One of the restrictions set forth in the Declaration of Covenants provides that the lots be used only for single-family residences, and that no trade, commerce, or business may be conducted in any single-family residence. The Declaration of Covenants gives the community association the right to assign all of its rights, powers, titles, easements, and estates granted to it under the Declaration of Covenants. The community association assigned \"all the rights, powers, titles, easements, and estates granted to or conferred upon it by the Declaration of Covenants\" to a municipal corporation, the city.

Stan was married to Morgana and had two children, Andrew and Beverly. Walter's will provided in part:\"The net income from this trust shall be paid to my son, Stan, for his life. Upon Stan's death, the net income is to be paid to any widow of Stan. Upon the death of Stan's widow, Trend Trust Company shall then pay the income (from said trust) to the living children of my sister, Harriet, in equal shares. \"Harriet's only surviving child, Grace, was born in 2001.

The three sailors had gone without food for two weeks and were on the verge of dying of starvation. Each of the sailors, however, still had a small amount of water left in their canteens with which to subsist. One night, the defendant took the water from the victim's canteen and poured it into his own canteen while the victim slept. The defendant did this in the hope that the extra water would make it possible for him to live a couple of more days so that he would be able to walk across the island to look for help. The next day, the victim died from starvation and dehydration. Two days later, the defendant and the other sailor were rescued. The defendant never walked across the island because he was too weak from body weight loss.\nB: A defendant and a victim were on a hiking expedition together. They were longtime hiking buddies who had climbed many steep and precipitous mountains in the past. As the defendant and the victim were climbing a dangerously steep incline, their ropes suddenly became entangled. As a result of the entanglement, the victim fell 50 feet before he was able to regain his balance and footing. However, the victim's fall caused the defendant to lose his balance, and he was in jeopardy of falling off the mountain. In order to avoid falling, the defendant cut the safety rope that held the victim. This caused the victim to fall 400 feet to his death.\nC: A defendant, who was intoxicated, was driving his car home along a heavily traveled highway. In his inebriated condition, the defendant was swerving his vehicle across the highway. Suddenly, a school bus loaded with children made a wrong turn and headed directly into the path of the defendant's auto. In order to avoid crashing head-on with the school bus, the defendant turned his vehicle onto the sidewalk and struck a victim, a paraplegic, who was confined to a wheelchair. The defendant's auto crushed the victim to death.\nD: A defendant, a bank teller, was on duty when two robbers held up the bank. She was taken hostage and ordered to drive their getaway car. As they were being pursued by the police, the defendant was commanded to drive excessively fast to avoid being captured. While driving at a speed of nearly 100 M. P. H. , the defendant approached a busy intersection and saw the victim, a blind person, with a guide dog walking across the street. She slowed down to avoid hitting the pedestrian with the dog. As she did so, one of the robbers stuck a gun against her head and threatened to kill her if she didn't speed through the intersection. Afraid she would be murdered, the defendant accelerated into the path of the victim, killing him and his guide dog.\n\nWhat is the answer?\n\nPlease inference first, then provide the final answer (A/B/C/D) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",

        "question": "Given the question: A businessman is the owner of a pet products company, which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of a variety of pet supplies. The businessman's company manufactures such products as pet furniture, toys, beds, collars, leashes, cages, and vitamins. These items are distributed to pet stores throughout the United States and Europe. For many years, the company has conducted its operations from a large factory located in a small town in the southern part of the state. One of the businessman's biggest selling products is specially manufactured high-frequency dog-calling whistles. These whistles are sold to dog-training schools and canine divisions of many police departments. Although these whistles are not audible to people, they are audible to dogs over considerable distances. Two years ago, a breeder purchased an undeveloped lot in the small town in which the company's factory was located. On her property, the breeder constructed a pet hotel, which was used as a boarding kennel for dogs and cats. This boarding facility was situated about 100 yards from the company's factory. Unknown to the breeder, high-frequency sound waves often emanated from the company's factory when dog-calling whistles were being tested. These sound waves caused the breeder's dogs to howl uncontrollably for many hours during the day and seriously interfered with the operation of her business. The breeder now brings an action against the businessman and the company to recover damages for the interference with her business caused by the high-frequency sound that reaches her kennel. The court should rule in favor of\n\nand the options:\nA: the businessman, because the breeder came to the nuisance after his factory had already been in operation for a number of years.\nB: the businessman, because the breeder's business is abnormally sensitive to harm caused by the high-frequency sound waves.\nC: the breeder, because the high-frequency sound waves constitute a trespass to her premises.\nD: the breeder, because the high-frequency sound waves have seriously interfered with the operation of her business.\n\nWhat is the answer?\n\nPlease inference first, then provide the final answer (A/B/C/D) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",

While the sound waves interfere significantly with her operation, this sensitivity does not generally constitute a liability for the businessman. The breeder's business vulnerability to the sound is an inherent aspect of her business environment. Therefore, the ruling should favor the businessman, because the breeder's business is abnormally sensitive to harm caused by the high-frequency sound waves.  \nFinal Answer: B",
