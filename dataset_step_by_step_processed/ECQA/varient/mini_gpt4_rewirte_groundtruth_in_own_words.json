The notion of pleasure would be misplaced in such a context, as witnessing such an act is likely to evoke shock, not happiness. Observing someone in prison would not be relevant to the actual scene of the killing. Guilt may arise afterwards, but it is not something seen at the scene itself.

It's also not appropriate to keep it outside randomly or to use the term 'house' as a vague location.

Therefore, painting is the best answer since it represents a kind of work that may involve bald eagles.\n\nFinal Answer: 4",

If you have a home with a courtyard, you might not have a lawn to manage anymore, as courtyards often feature hardscaping or alternative landscaping instead of grass. Children always require attention and care. The term \"asshole\" refers to a person and does not fit the context of things to care for. Spain is a country, and administrative responsibilities do not apply to home care. Lastly, an office complex is a completely different structure and does not relate to having a home with a courtyard.\n\nFinal Answer: 1",
