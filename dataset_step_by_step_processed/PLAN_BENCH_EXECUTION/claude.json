Here are the actions I can do\n\nPick up a block\nUnstack a block from on top of another block\nPut down a block\nStack a block on top of another block\n\nI have the following restrictions on my actions:\nI can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.\nI can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.\nI can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.\n I have executed the following action sequence:\n\n[ACTION SEQUENCE]\nunstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block\nput down the blue block\npick up the yellow block\nstack the yellow block on top of the blue block\n[ACTION SEQUENCE END]\n[RESULTING STATE]\nthe orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block, the red block is on the table and the blue block is on the table\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table, the blue block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.\n I have executed the following action sequence:\n\n[ACTION SEQUENCE]\nunstack the orange block from on top of the red block\nstack the orange block on top of the yellow block\npick up the blue block\n[ACTION SEQUENCE END]\n[RESULTING STATE]\n\nPlease inference first then provide the final plan at the end after the word 'Final Answer:'",

        "answer": "Let's analyze the action sequence and infer the resulting state:\n\n1. \"unstack the orange block from on top of the red block\"\n   - The orange block is no longer on top of the red block\n   - The hand is now holding the orange block\n   - The red block becomes clear\n\n2. \"stack the orange block on top of the yellow block\"\n   - The orange block is now on top of the yellow block\n   - The hand becomes empty\n   - The yellow block is no longer clear\n\n3. \"pick up the blue block\"\n   - The hand is now holding the blue block\n   - The blue block is no longer on the table\n\nBased on these actions and the initial conditions, we can infer:\n\n- The red block remains on the table and is now clear\n- The yellow block remains on the table\n- The orange block is on top of the yellow block\n- The blue block is being held by the hand\n- The orange block is clear (as nothing was stacked on it)\n\nFinal Answer: the red block is on the table, the yellow block is on the table, the red block is clear, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the hand is currently holding blue block, the orange block is clear",
