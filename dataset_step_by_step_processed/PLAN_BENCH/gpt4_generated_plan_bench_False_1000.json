Since the blue block is on top of the orange block, we first need to clear this by executing \"unstack blue block from orange block\". Now blue becomes clear and the orange block is clear as well.\n2. We then \"stack the blue block on the red block\" since red is on the table and clear. This results in blue being on red block.\n3. Next, we \"pick up the yellow block\" from the table as it is clear and we need to move it.\n4. After that, we \"stack the yellow block on top of the orange block\". Now orange block is no longer clear but yellow is on top.\n5. We need to adjust the stack of blue/red as our goal is eventually building it in a different order. We \"unstack blue block from red block\". Now blue becomes clear and hand will contain the blue block, red is sitting on the table again.\n6. \"Stack blue block on yellow block\" since yellow is clear.\n7. \"Pick up red block\" from table, since it is still clear.\n8.

Since both the orange block is clear and the hand is empty after the prior stacking, I can unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block.\n4. Finally, I can stack the orange block on top of the red block, as the red block is now clear after being previously stacked on the blue block.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(stack orange red)",

To achieve the necessary configuration, first unstack the orange block since it is on top of the red block: (unstack orange red). Now, the orange block is in hand.\n3. Put down the orange block onto the table to free the hand: (put-down orange).\n4. Pick up the red block since it is clear, and the hand is empty: (pick-up red).\n5.

        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE:\n\nGiven the initial conditions and the goal state, we need to rearrange the blocks so that the red block is on top of the blue block. The following steps outline the reasoning process:\n\n1. Initially, the orange block is on top of the blue block, which is on top of the red block. To gain access to the blue and red blocks, we must first remove the orange block. Thus, we unstack the orange block from the blue block. Since the orange block is clear and the hand is empty, this action is possible.\n\n2. After unstacking, the orange block is held in the hand. To proceed, we put down the orange block on the table, clearing the blue block.\n\n3. Now, the blue block is clear but is on top of the red block. We need the red block to eventually be on top of the blue block, so the next step is to unstack the blue block from the red block. This step is valid as the hand is empty, and the blue block is clear.\n\n4. After unstacking, we hold the blue block. We then put down the blue block on the table, making the red block visible and clear.\n\n5. At this point, the red block is on top of the yellow block on the table. We must move the red block so it can later be stacked on the blue block. So, we unstack the red block from the yellow block. This is possible because the hand is empty, and the red block is clear.\n\n6. Finally, with the red block in hand and the blue block on the table and clear, we stack the red block on the blue block, achieving the desired goal state.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(stack red blue)",

This makes the base correct with the orange on the yellow.\n   - Pick up the blue block and stack it on top of the orange block, arranging the middle position correctly in the stack.\n   - Finally, pick up the red block and stack it on top of the blue block to complete the configuration.\n\nFollowing these steps ensures the blocks are rearranged to match the goal conditions.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow blue)  \n(put-down yellow)  \n(unstack red orange)  \n(put-down red)  \n(pick-up orange)  \n(stack orange yellow)  \n(pick-up blue)  \n(stack blue orange)  \n(pick-up red)  \n(stack red blue)",

Start by observing the initial conditions where the red block is clear and is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, and the blue block is clear on the table.\n\n2. To achieve the goal where the red block is on top of the orange block (which is already satisfied), and the yellow block is on top of the blue block, we need to move the yellow block onto the blue block.\n\n3. The first step is to remove the red block from on top of the orange block, making the orange block clear. This would imply:\n   - (unstack red orange)\n\n4. Though initially, it seems necessary to move red off orange and then, counterintuitively, stack it on blue, then unstack this step again since no further instruction makes it clear -- a misunderstanding from instructions because you start by ensuring red is only temporarily on blue. This does not directly help the final configuration but aligns with the transcription of steps witnessed. Thus:\n   - (stack red blue)\n\n5. However, seemingly unrelated to this goal, or redundancy misstep in transcript, ensure the orange and yellow blocks become clear. This points to:\n   - (unstack orange yellow)\n   - (put-down orange)\n\n6. The blue block is already clear, but for correctness pedal back:\n   - (unstack red blue)\n   - (stack red orange) to originally preserve given setup after the above.\n\n7. Finally, move the yellow block to achieve the ultimate goal which was yellow on top of blue:\n   - (pick-up yellow)\n   - (stack yellow blue)\n\nBy considering actions and blocks' clear status via hand availability and constraints, the steps pursued reflect the mismatched transcription reordering guided by all known viable moves respecting constraints.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red orange)  \n(stack red blue)  \n(unstack orange yellow)  \n(put-down orange)  \n(unstack red blue)  \n(stack red orange)  \n(pick-up yellow)  \n(stack yellow blue)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the yellow block and the orange block on top of the red block, given the initial conditions, we can break down the steps as follows:\n\n1. **Unstack Red from Blue:** The red block is initially on the blue block, which is on top of the orange block. The red block is clear, so we can unstack it from the blue block since our hand is empty.\n\n2. **Stack Red on Yellow:** Once we have unstacked the red block and are holding it, we can stack it on the yellow block because the yellow block is clear.\n\n3. **Unstack Blue from Orange:** Now the goal is to make the orange block clear so we can eventually stack it on the red block. The blue block is currently on top of the orange block and is clear, so we can unstack the blue block from the orange block.\n\n4. **Put Down Blue:** After unstacking the blue block, we need our hand free to handle the orange block, so we put down the blue block on the table.\n\n5. **Pick Up Orange:** With the blue block out of the way, the orange block is now clear and on the table, so we can pick up the orange block.\n\n6. **Stack Orange on Red:** Finally, we stack the orange block, which we are holding, on top of the red block, which is on the yellow block. This meets the final goal requirement.\n\nThese actions follow the rules provided in the task description while meeting the initial conditions and achieving the goal.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red blue)\n(stack red yellow)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)",

Blue block and orange block are clear since they are on the table with nothing on top.\n\n2. Goal: Red block must be on top of the orange block, and orange block must be on top of the blue block.\n\n3. Start by addressing the impediments to reaching the goal:\n   - The yellow block is on top of the orange block, so we need to first unstack yellow from orange.\n\n4. Unstack 'yellow' from 'orange':\n   - Given that the red and yellow blocks are individually clear and the hand is empty, unstacking these blocks is possible.\n\n5. Put down 'yellow':\n   - Now with yellow in hand, we put it down to free the hand for the next action.\n\n6. Unstack 'red' from 'blue':\n   - With the handling completed for yellow, red becomes the focus, so unstack red from under blue as required by the goal position.\n\n7. Stack 'red' onto 'yellow':\n   - Red is now put on top of yellow to give us space for orange on blue in the next steps.\n\n8. Pick up 'orange':\n   - Red is now handled, so orange needs to be removed from the table for stacking onto blue.\n\n9. Stack 'orange' onto 'blue':\n   - Carefully place orange directly on the blue block as it is set to be the direct support for future setup.\n\n10. Unstack 'red' from 'yellow':\n    - Now with orange in the correct position, red must be moved again to fulfill the required goal structure.\n\n11.

Our goal requires the yellow block to be on the orange block eventually, but before doing that, we can use the intermediate step by stacking the yellow block on top of the blue block (making the blue block no longer clear), which was put down earlier.\n\n5. Then, we pick up the orange block, which is already clear on the table.\n\n6.

The hand is empty, which means we can start by picking up a clear block.\n\n1. The first action will be to pick up the blue block, as it is clear and on the table. This satisfies the condition of only picking up a block that is clear and on the table.\n\n2. The next action is to stack the blue block on top of the orange block. Since we are holding the blue block and the orange block is clear, this stack operation is valid. After this step, the orange block will no longer be clear.\n\nWith these two steps, we achieve one part of the goal: the blue block is now on top of the orange block.

Stacking the red block fulfills part of the goal: red block on top of the orange block.\n\n3. The subsequent step is to unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block. Since the yellow block is on top of the blue block and clear, this action can be performed once the hand is empty.\n\n4. The yellow block in hand is put down elsewhere, so the hand becomes empty again.\n\n5. Next, the blue block is picked up.

The blue block is on the table and the orange block is also on the table, and the hand is empty.\n\nTo achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the blue block, the blue block on top of the orange block, and the yellow block on top of the red block, we have to rearrange the blocks according to the given allowable actions and restrictions.\n\n1. Start by unstacking the red block from on top of the yellow block. This action is allowed because the red block is clear, and the hand is empty. The hand will now be holding the red block, and the yellow block becomes clear.\n   \n2. Put down the red block on the table. This action is permitted because the hand is holding the red block. The hand becomes empty.\n\n3. Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block. The yellow block is clear, and the hand is empty, so this action is possible. Now the hand holds the yellow block, and the orange block is clear.\n\n4. Put down the yellow block on the table. This puts the yellow block on the table and empties the hand.\n\n5. Pick up the blue block from the table, since it is clear and the hand is empty. Now the hand holds the blue block.\n\n6. Stack the blue block on top of the clear orange block. The action clears the hand and obscures the orange block with the blue block on top.\n\n7. Pick up the red block from where it was placed on the table because it is clear. The hand is not empty now and holds the red block.\n\n8. Stack the red block on top of the blue block. This clears the hand and obscures the blue block.\n\n9. Finally, pick up the yellow block from the table as it is clear. The hand now holds the yellow block.\n\n10. Stack the yellow block on top of the red block, completing the desired configuration.

To free the yellow block for stacking elsewhere, we must first unstack these blocks.\n  \n2. **Stack Action:**\n   - The goal is to have the yellow block on top of the red block, so we will eventually need to stack the yellow block back on the red block. However, we need to manage intermediate steps to position the blue and orange blocks correctly.\n\n3. **Unstack and Put-down Actions:**\n    - We see that the blue block is already on the table, but the red block is under it. Thus, to free the red block, we must unstack the yellow block, handle the yellow block temporarily, and unstack the red block from the blue block.\n\n4. **Stack Actions:**\n    - Once unstacked, we can temporarily put down the red block if needed.\n    - Now, we have the freedom to handle yellow and orange blocks for further placements.\n\n5. **Goal Achievement:**\n   - We are to place the blue block on the yellow block, and then the orange block on top of the blue block. \n   - We ensure the orange block is correctly placed on the blue and the blue on the yellow. Once each block is positioned according to the goal, we must ensure that the yellow is on the red as desired.\n\nFollowing this sequence, we need to manipulate the blocks with respect to the constraints provided. To achieve the goal:\n\n- Unstack the yellow block from the red block.\n- Temporarily stack the yellow block onto the orange block.\n- Unstack the red block from the blue block and place it on the table to facilitate further actions.\n- Unstack then place down the yellow block for proper re-arrangement.\n- Stack the yellow block back onto the red block.\n- Pick up the blue block and stack it onto the yellow block.\n- Pick up the orange block and stack it onto the blue block. \n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow red)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)",

        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE:\n\nTo achieve the goal of having the blue block on top of the yellow block and the orange block on top of the red block, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Unstack orange from blue:** Begin by unstacking the orange block, which is initially on top of the blue block, since the orange block is clear.\n\n2. **Put down orange:** Put the orange block down on the table to free our hand for the next action.\n\n3. **Unstack blue from red:** Next, unstack the blue block from the red block. The blue block is clear (since we've already removed the orange), and this step will free the blue block to be moved.\n\n4. **Stack blue on orange:** Stack the blue block on top of the orange block. Now, the blue and orange blocks are in their proper relation (blue above orange), though they are not currently part of our desired final structures.\n\n5. **Unstack red from yellow:** Unstack the red block next. The red block, initially on top of the yellow block, is currently clear.\n\n6. **Put down red:** Put the red block down separately, so it later can form a base for the orange block.\n\n7. **Unstack blue from orange:** To prepare for the final positions, unstack the blue block from the orange again.\n\n8. **Stack blue on yellow:** Place the blue block on top of the yellow block. This fulfills one part of our goal (blue on yellow).\n\n9. **Pick up orange:** With your hand empty, pick up the orange block from the table.\n\n10. **Stack orange on red:** Finally, stack the orange block on top of the red block, fulfilling the other part of our goal.\n\nThese steps follow logically from the given actions and conditions.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack blue red)\n(stack blue orange)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)",

To move the yellow block to the red block, we must first unstack the yellow block from the orange block.\n5. Since the hand is empty, we can unstack the yellow block from the orange block.\n6. After unstacking, we are holding the yellow block, and the hand is no longer empty.\n7. The red block is clear, and we can stack the yellow block on top of the red block.\n8. Once the yellow block is stacked on the red block, the hand becomes empty.\n\nBoth conditions are now met: the orange block remains on top of the blue block, and the yellow block is on top of the red block.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow red)",

Our goal is to rearrange the blocks as stated.\n\n2. The first action (unstack yellow blue) is valid because the yellow block is clear (nothing on top of it) and the hand is empty. \n\n3. After unstacking the yellow block, I am holding the yellow block. I need to put the yellow block back on the table to proceed, hence the next action is (put-down yellow). \n\n4. After putting down the yellow block, my hand is empty. Now, to achieve the goal, the stack involving the blue and red blocks needs to be rearranged.\n\n5. I can unstack the blue block from the red block next because the blue block is clear and my hand is empty: (unstack blue red).\n\n6. I want ultimately to have the blue block on top of the yellow block, so I proceed with (stack blue yellow). \n\n7. Now, the blue block is on the intended yellow block, and my hand is empty again.

The final state requires the red block to be on top of the yellow block, which is already satisfied. Therefore, we do not need to move the red block.\n2. We need to move the blue block so that it is on top of the orange block. Currently, the blue block is not clear because the orange block is resting on it.

Once the orange block is put down, the blue block becomes clear, so we can unstack it from the red block.\n5.

Since the initial conditions state that the red block is clear and on top of the yellow block, the first step is to unstack the red block from the yellow block. This is allowed because the red block is clear and we need to hold it. Thus, the action to unstack the red block from the yellow block is valid.\n\n2. After unstacking the red block, it is in hand and should be put down to free the hand for the subsequent actions. The plan can proceed to put down the red block since it is being held.\n\n3. The initial conditions show that the blue block is already clear and sitting on the table. To stack the blue block onto the yellow block, we need to first pick it up. Therefore, the next action is to pick up the blue block.\n\n4.

The goal here is to make the orange block accessible for future actions.\n\n   - **Put down the yellow block**: After unstacking the yellow block, it needs to be placed on the table as a preparatory step for stacking the orange block on top of it. This action also empties the hand.\n\n   - **Unstack the orange block from the red block**: Now, the orange block is clear since the yellow block was removed. Unstacking the orange block makes it possible to manipulate it freely.\n\n   - **Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block**: With the orange block ready to be stacked and the yellow block picked up earlier, the next step is to stack the orange block on top of the yellow block.

The hand is empty initially, so we can perform this action.\n\n2. **Put down blue**: Now that we are holding blue after unstacking it, we need to put it down temporarily so that we can handle other blocks.\n\n3. **Unstack red from yellow**: With the hand empty again, we can unstack red from yellow.\n\n4. **Put down red**: We put down the red block somewhere on the table for now to clear up the hand and handle the yellow block.\n\n5. **Unstack yellow from orange**: The hand is now empty, so we can unstack the yellow block from the orange one.\n\n6. **Put down yellow**: Place the yellow block aside as it is not part of the desired stack configuration.\n\n7. **Pick up blue**: Blue needs to be placed on top of orange as part of the goal, so we pick it up.\n\n8. **Stack blue on orange**: We can now stack blue on top of orange since orange is clear.\n\n9. **Pick up red**: With blue on orange, our next step requires us to place red on blue, so we pick up the red block.\n\n10. **Stack red on blue**: Finally, we stack red on blue, completing the goal of having red on top of blue and blue on top of orange.\n\nThe steps outlined take into account the conditions and actions allowed. \n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)",

Now, to achieve the goal configuration:\n   - Pick up the yellow block, which is clear and unstacked, and stack it on top of the red block (on the table).\n   - The yellow block stacking on red makes the yellow on top of the red.\n   - Pick up the orange block, which was on the table and is clear, and stack it on top of the yellow block.\n   - The orange block stacking on yellow makes the orange on top of the yellow.\n   - Finally, pick up the blue block and stack it on top of the orange block to achieve the complete goal configuration.\n\nTherefore, the actions are sequenced as follows:\n\nINFERENCE: The first step is unstacking the red from the orange, and putting down the red block on the table; this clears space for the correct arrangement.

        "answer": "Given the initial conditions and the goal, we need to follow a series of steps to reach the desired arrangement of blocks. Initially, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on the table, the orange block is on the table, and we're starting with an empty hand. \n\nThe goal is to have the red block on top of the orange block and the blue block on top of the yellow block. Here's how the plan can be broken down:\n\n1. **Unstack the red block**: The red block is currently on top of the yellow block and is clear. Therefore, the first step is to unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block, which makes the hand no longer empty.\n\n2. **Stack the red block on the orange block**: Now that the red block is in hand, we can place it on top of the orange block. Since the orange block is clear, we can successfully stack the red block on top.\n\n3. **Pick up the blue block**: Since the hand is now empty after placing the red block, we can pick up the blue block from the table.\n\n4. **Stack the blue block on the yellow block**: The yellow block is clear, allowing the blue block to be stacked on top of it.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that both the conditions for picking up, unstacking, putting down, and stacking blocks are satisfied at each stage. \n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red yellow)  \n(stack red orange)  \n(pick-up blue)  \n(stack blue yellow)",

Put down the orange block onto the table: (put-down orange)\n6.
