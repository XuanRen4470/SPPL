So, you can place it on the table, which ensures it is now clear.\n\n3. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block**: Now that the orange block is clear on the table, you need to remove the yellow block from its position on the red block since it is not directly related to our final goal yet.\n\n4. **Put down the yellow block**: After unstacking the yellow block, you place it on the table, which will ensure it is now clear.\n\n5. **Pick up the red block**: Now you can pick up the red block since it is clear and you have your hand empty.\n\n6. **Stack the red block on top of the orange block**: Next, you place the red block on top of the orange block you just put down.\n\n7. **Pick up the blue block**: The blue block is clear on the table and can be picked up.\n\n8. **Stack the blue block on top of the red block**: Now stack the blue block on top of your newly placed red block.\n\n9. **Pick up the yellow block**: Finally, you pick up the yellow block again, as it is clear on the table.\n\n10. **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block**: Complete the arrangement by placing the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n\nFollowing this sequence of actions will achieve the desired arrangement of the blocks.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange yellow) (put-down orange) (unstack yellow red) (put-down yellow) (pick-up red) (stack red orange) (pick-up blue) (stack blue red) (pick-up yellow) (stack yellow blue)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the blue block on top of the yellow block and the yellow block on top of the orange block, we can break down the actions systematically.\n\n1. First, we need to unstack the orange block from on top of the red block. Since the orange block is clear and we can only operate when our hand is empty, we will proceed with this action.\n\n2. After unstacking the orange block, we put it down since we need to free up the blocks beneath it.\n\n3. Next, we need to unstack the red block from on top of the blue block. The red block is currently on top of the orange block, which makes it possible to unstack. However, we must ensure that the blue block remains clear during this operation.\n\n4. After unstacking the red block from the blue block, we put the red block down.\n\n5. The next step is to unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block. This can be performed now since the blue block can be accessed.\n\n6. After unstacking the blue block, we need to stack it on top of the red block.\n\n7. Next, we pick up the yellow block, which should now be clear after previously unstacking.\n\n8. We then stack the yellow block on top of the orange block.\n\n9. Lastly, we return to the red block and unstack it from the blue block, which will allow us to place the blue block on top of the yellow block.\n\n10. Finally, we stack the blue block on top of the yellow block.\n\nPutting these actions together, the plan is as follows:\n\n**Final Answer:**\n(unstack orange red)  \n(put-down orange)  \n(unstack red blue)  \n(put-down red)  \n(unstack blue yellow)  \n(stack blue red)  \n(pick-up yellow)  \n(stack yellow orange)  \n(unstack blue red)  \n(stack blue yellow)",

This will allow you to manipulate the blocks more effectively.\n5. **Pick up the blue block**. With your hand empty now, you can move the blue block to stack it.\n6. **Stack the blue block on top of the red block**.

Start by unstacking the yellow block from on top of the blue block. This action allows you to remove the yellow block and make it clear.\n2. Once you have unstacked the yellow block, put it down on the table, which will clear your hand and allow you to perform another action.\n3. Next, unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block. This action is essential for ensuring the correct arrangement of blocks.\n4. Now you can stack the blue block on top of the yellow block. This places the blue block in a clear position above the yellow block.\n5. After that, unstack the orange block from on top of the red block. You can now manipulate the orange block freely.\n6. Put down the orange block to make your hand empty again.\n7. Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block. This prepares the blue block to be moved to its final position.\n8. Stack the blue block on top of the red block, successfully meeting part of your goal structure.\n9. Now, pick up the orange block again to begin its placement.\n10. Stack the orange block on top of the blue block to complete that portion of the rearrangement.\n11. Finally, pick up the yellow block and stack it on top of the orange block, achieving the final configuration you wanted.\n\nFollowing these steps will ensure you achieve your goal in compliance with all the outlined restrictions and processes.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow blue) (put-down yellow) (unstack blue orange) (stack blue yellow) (unstack orange red) (put-down orange) (unstack blue yellow) (stack blue red) (pick-up orange) (stack orange blue) (pick-up yellow) (stack yellow orange)",

You will unstack the red block from the orange block.\n\n4. **Put down the red block**: With the red block now in your possession, put it down on the table.\n\n5. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block**: Next, unstack the orange block from the blue block. This requires that the orange block is clear.\n\n6. **Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block**: Now, you can stack the orange block on top of the yellow block that you previously put down.\n\n7. **Pick up the blue block**: After stacking the orange block, pick up the blue block next.\n\n8. **Stack the blue block on top of the orange block**: Finally, place the blue block on top of the orange block.\n\n9. **Pick up the red block**: Now pick up the red block that you set down earlier.\n\n10. **Stack the red block on top of the blue block**: Complete your goal by stacking the red block on top of the blue block.\n\nFollowing these steps will achieve the desired arrangement of all the blocks satisfactorily.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow red) (put-down yellow) (unstack red orange) (put-down red) (unstack orange blue) (stack orange yellow) (pick-up blue) (stack blue orange) (pick-up red) (stack red blue)",
