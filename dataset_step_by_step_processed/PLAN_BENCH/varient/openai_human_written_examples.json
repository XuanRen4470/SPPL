        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE: The initial conditions include stack structures and clear blocks, enabling certain actions while adhering to the restrictions outlined. We start with blue on table, clear, and orange on yellow. Our goal is to create a stack where the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue follows on top of the red, and the yellow is on top of the blue. We unstack starting from the topmost visible structure, ensuring to unstack orange from yellow at first, putting it down because we want red on orange. Next, unstack yellow from red since it will go on top of blue eventually; put yellow down as well, now the red is clear. Pick up red, and place it on the orange. Now, blue is present on the table and is picked next, to stack it atop red. Finally, pick up yellow, and place it on blue, achieving the goal stack.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange yellow)  \n(put-down orange)  \n(unstack yellow red)  \n(put-down yellow)  \n(pick-up red)  \n(stack red orange)  \n(pick-up blue)  \n(stack blue red)  \n(pick-up yellow)  \n(stack yellow blue)  ",

Initially, the orange block is on top of the red block, and the yellow block is on top of the blue block, both the red and blue blocks are on the table.\n\nFirstly, we need to unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block and put it down, since we don\u2019t need the yellow block on top of any other block at the final state. Then, we unstack the orange block from on top of the red block because our goal requires the red block to be on top of the blue block and the orange block to eventually be on the red block, not the reverse.\n\nNext, we stack the orange block on top of the yellow block temporarily to free up our hand. After this, we pick up the red block and stack it on top of the blue block, as required by the goal.

Since the red block is clear itself, we unstack the red block from the orange block.\n\n2. Once unstacked, we need to put down the red block to free our hand for further actions.\n\n3. With the red block out of the way, the orange block is now clear. Therefore, we can pick up the orange block.\n\n4.

We begin by unstacking the yellow block from the blue block, which is a necessary step to clear the blue block for further operations.\n2. Next, we put down the yellow block on the table to free up our hand, providing us a clear hand to manipulate other blocks as needed.\n3. We then unstack the blue block from the red block. This allows the red block to become clear, and it also ensures that the blue block is now free to be moved or restacked elsewhere; crucial for our goal state.\n4. With the blue block now free, we stack it on the yellow block, temporarily building part of the goal arrangement but primarily to manage positioning.\n5. The orange block, which is currently sitting idle, is picked up and then stacked on the red block, setting the bottom part of the final arrangement since the arrangement within the goal is blue > orange > red.\n   \n6.

The red block is on the table, which means it is clear and not beneath any other block. \n\nOur goal is to have the red block on top of the yellow block. However, currently, the yellow block is on the orange block, which is on the blue block. Therefore, before we can place the red block on the yellow block, we need to free up the yellow block. This means we need to move the blocks that are currently above the yellow block.\n\n- The orange block is above the blue block and below the yellow block, so we must unstack the yellow block from the orange block first.\n- The plan must ensure that the yellow block is left clear so that the red block can be stacked on top of the yellow block.\n  \nSince the yellow block is already on top of the orange block, to execute a correct series of moves according to the goal statement: \n1. Since the red block is clear and our goal implies moving it to stack on top of the yellow block, the red block should be picked up.\n2.

        "answer": "Based on the initial conditions given, the stack order is yellow on top of orange, which is on top of blue, and blue is on top of red. The red block is on the table. The goal is to rearrange the blocks to have blue on top of orange, orange on top of yellow, and yellow on top of red. \n\nLet's break down the steps needed to achieve this goal. The current arrangement is yellow > orange > blue > red. Target arrangement is blue > orange > yellow > red. The first step is to clear each block down to the blue block, which is below the orange block. This requires unstacking the yellow block from the orange block and putting it down, followed by unstacking the orange block from the blue block and putting it down, and finally unstacking the blue block from the red block and putting it down. After unstacking them, we put down each block temporarily to ensure the desired order at the end.\n\nThen, we start building the final arrangement from the bottom by picking up the yellow block and stacking it on top of the red block because that's the final place for it. Next, we pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the yellow block to follow the goal's arrangement sequence. After this, the blue block needs to be placed on top of the orange block, so pick up the blue block and do that final step.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)",

Initially, the blocks are stacked such that blue is on top of the orange block, the orange is on top of the yellow, the yellow is on top of the red, and the red is directly on the table.

Finally, using the red block (which is on the table and clear), stack it on top of the orange. \n6.

After unstacking, we put down the blue block. Then, pick up the yellow block from the table and stack it on the blue block, ensuring they are now in the correct order (yellow on blue).\n\nNext, unstack the orange block from the red block since both are initially clear. Finally, stack the orange block on top of the yellow block. \n\nThis sequence of maneuvering will successfully achieve the goal of having the orange block on top of the yellow block and the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n\nFinal Answer:  \n(unstack blue yellow)  \n(put-down blue)  \n(pick-up yellow)  \n(stack yellow blue)  \n(unstack orange red)  \n(stack orange yellow)  ",

        "answer": "Inference: The goal is to stack the blue block on top of the orange block, which is on top of the yellow block. Initially, the orange block is on top of the red block, which is on the table. The blue block, orange block, and yellow block are all clear and on the table. To achieve the goal, the first step is to unstack the orange block from the red block and stack it onto the yellow block, which is clear and meets one of our goals (orange on yellow). Next, we need to pick up the blue block from the table since it is clear, and stack it on top of the orange block. This sequence fulfills the goal arrangement.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack orange red)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)",
