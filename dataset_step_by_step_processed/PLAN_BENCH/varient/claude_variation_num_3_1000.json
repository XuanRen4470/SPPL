        "answer": "Based on the given initial conditions and goal, here's a plan to achieve the desired configuration:\n\n1. Unstack the orange block from on top of the red block\n   This frees up the orange block, which we need to move.\n\n2.

Pick up the blue block\n   The blue block is already clear and on the table, so we can pick it up.\n\n4. Stack the blue block on top of the orange block\n   This completes the goal configuration.\n\nThis plan follows all the given restrictions and uses only the allowed actions.
