It's already on top of the red block, which satisfies part of our goal state.\n\nThis plan efficiently achieves the goal state with minimal moves.

Stack the red block on top of the blue block\n\nThis plan works because:\n- We start by freeing the red block, which needs to be on top at the end\n- The blue block is already on top of the orange block, so we don't need to move it\n- We only need to move the red block to its final position\n\nThis plan follows all the given restrictions:\n- We only move one block at a time\n- We ensure the hand is empty before picking up or unstacking\n- We only unstack or pick up clear blocks\n- We put down blocks we're holding before picking up new ones\n- We only stack onto clear blocks\n\nThis sequence of actions will achieve the goal state efficiently without unnecessary moves.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack yellow red)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)",
