Now you're holding the yellow block, and the blue block is clear.\n\n4. **Put down the yellow block:**\n   - After unstacking, you're holding the yellow block. You can put it down, clearing the hand for the next action. The yellow block is now on the table.\n\n5. **Unstack the blue block from the orange block:**\n   - The blue block is clear and ready to be unstacked. Now you're holding the blue block, and the orange block is clear.\n\n6. **Put down the blue block:**\n   - You place the blue block on the table to continue arranging the blocks as per the goal. Your hands are free again.\n\n7. **Unstack the orange block from the red block:**\n   - The orange block is clear, and the hand is empty. The orange block can now be unstacked. You're now holding the orange block.\n\n8. **Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block:**\n   - The yellow block is on the table and clear, allowing you to stack the orange block onto it. This prepares the yellow and orange blocks for the final goal configuration.\n\n9. **Pick up the red block:**\n   - The red block is clear and on the table, so you can pick it up without restrictions. You're now holding the red block.\n\n10. **Stack the red block on top of the blue block:**\n    - The blue block, which was placed on the table, is clear, allowing you to stack the red block on top of it, accomplishing part of the final goal arrangement.\n\n11. **Unstack the orange block from the yellow block:**\n    - The orange block is clear, making it eligible to be unstacked. You hold the orange block, ready to complete the goal setup.\n\n12. **Stack the orange block on top of the red block:**\n    - The red block is under the blue block, and it is now clear, allowing you to stack the orange block on top, matching the desired end state for these blocks.\n\n13. **Pick up the yellow block:**\n    - The yellow block is on the table and is clear, so you pick it up to complete the stacking sequence.\n\n14. **Stack the yellow block on the orange block:**\n    - The orange block is clear, allowing the final stacking of the yellow block on top of the orange block, thus achieving the overall goal state configuration.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack orange red)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(stack orange red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)",

Once unstacked, the orange block is in hand and the red block becomes clear.\n\n2. **Put down the orange block**. This action vacates the hand and keeps the orange block on the table.\n\n3. **Unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block**. With no orange block on top and a clear red block, the red block can be unstacked. It is now held in hand, and the yellow block is clear.\n\n4. **Put down the red block** on the table. This step empties the hand.\n\n5. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block**. Since the yellow block is clear, it can be unstacked, allowing it to be held in hand, while the blue block below is now clear.\n\n6. **Put down the yellow block**. Freeing the hand and ensuring stability for the next rearrangement phase.\n\n7. **Pick up the orange block** since it is clear and on the table. This prepares it for stacking onto another block.\n\n8. **Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block**. The yellow block is clear at this point, so this stacking is permissible and clears the hand.\n\n9. **Pick up the red block** as it is also on the table and clear, allowing it to be managed next in the sequence.\n\n10. **Stack the red block on top of the orange block**. This maintains the needed order and clears the hand again.\n\n11. Finally, **pick up the blue block**. With the blue being clear and on the table, this is a viable action.\n\n12. **Stack the blue block on top of the red block**. This completes the goal as the blue block is now positioned correctly on top of the red block.\n\nThese steps ensure compliance with constraints and result in achieving the goal configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange red)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue red)",

This makes our hand no longer empty and the red block clear.\n\n   - Step 2: Put down the orange block. Since we are holding the orange block, we can put it down to make our hand empty again.\n\n   - Step 3: Unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block. With our hand empty and the red block clear, we can unstack it. Now, the hand holds the red block and the yellow block becomes clear.\n\n   - Step 4: Put down the red block. The hand holds the red block, allowing us to put it down and make our hand empty.\n\n   - Step 5: Pick up the blue block. With the hand empty and the blue block clear and on the table, we can pick it up and hold it.\n\n   - Step 6: Stack the blue block on top of the red block. The red block is clear on the table, and while holding the blue block, we can stack it on top. This action leaves our hand empty.\n\n   - Step 7: Pick up the yellow block. The yellow block is clear and on the table, allowing us to pick it up.\n\n   - Step 8: Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.

You can put it down to free up the hand, making the yellow block clear.\n\n3. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the red block:** The blue block is clear, and the hand is empty, enabling you to unstack it. After the action, the hand holds the blue block, and the red block becomes clear.\n\n4. **Stack the blue block on top of the orange block:** The goal requires the blue block to be on top of the orange block. Since you're holding the blue block and the hand isn't empty, you can stack it on the cleared orange block.\n\n5. **Pick up the yellow block:** The yellow block is clear and on the table, and the hand is empty after stacking the blue block, so you can pick up the yellow block.\n\n6. **Stack the yellow block on top of the red block:** For the final goal, the yellow block must be on the cleared red block.

        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions and Goal Analysis:**\n   - Initial conditions: The red block is clear because the yellow block is underneath the orange block, making it covered. The yellow block can be unstacked as it is clear. \n   - Goal: The red block should be on top of the orange block, and the orange block should be on top of the blue block.\n\n2. **Plan Steps:**\n\n   - **Unstack the yellow block from the orange block:**\n     - The yellow block is clear, and the hand is empty, which satisfies the condition for this action.\n     - Now the orange block is clear.\n   \n   - **Put down the yellow block:**\n     - Holding the yellow block allows putting it down, ensuring the hand becomes empty for subsequent actions.\n\n   - **Unstack the red block from the blue block:**\n     - The red block on top of the blue block is clear since nothing obstructs it. Hence, we can unstack it. \n     - The red block is now being held, and blue becomes clear.\n\n   - **Stack the red block on top of the yellow block:**\n     - With the clear yellow block, the red block that is being held can be stacked on top of it. This ensures the hand becomes empty again.\n     - Now, the yellow block becomes non-clear due to the red block on top of it.\n\n   - **Pick up the orange block:**\n     - As the orange block is clear and on the table, it can be picked up to make the hand occupied.\n   \n   - **Stack the orange block on top of the blue block:**\n     - With a clear blue block, the orange being held is stacked on top of it to set partial completion of the goal.\n\n   - **Unstack the red block from the yellow block:**\n     - The red block is clear on top of the yellow block and can be unstacked.\n     - Now it is in hand with the yellow block becoming clear due to red removal.\n\n   - **Stack the red block on top of the orange block:**\n     - With the orange block on top of the blue block, and now clear, the red block being held can be stacked on it to meet the final goal.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack red blue)\n(stack red yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(stack red orange)",

The blue block is on top of the yellow block, which is on top of the orange block.\n\n2. The goal is to have the orange block on top of the red block and the yellow block on top of the orange block.\n\n3. Begin with unstacking blocks sequentially to create a path to achieving the goal state:\n\n   - **Unstack the red block from on top of the blue block.** \n     - The red block is clear at the start, making this a valid action. Holding the red block now makes the hand non-empty.\n   \n   - **Put down the red block.** \n     - With the red block in hand, it can be placed on the table. This action empties the hand and sets the red block as clear again.\n\n   - **Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block.** \n     - Now that the red block is down, the blue block can be unstacked since it is clear. The hand now holds the blue block.\n\n   - **Put down the blue block.** \n     - The blue block held in hand is now put on the table, making the hand empty again.\n\n   - **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block.** \n     - With no blocks above it after placing the blue block down, the yellow block is now clear and can be unstacked. Holding the yellow block now.\n\n   - **Stack the yellow block onto the blue block.** \n     - The yellow block is held and can be stacked onto the now-clear blue block. This action completes part of the intermediate stack and clears the orange block underneath.\n\n4. With an empty hand, proceed to position the orange block correctly in relation to the red block:\n   \n   - **Pick up the orange block.** \n     - Now clear, the orange block is picked up from the table, occupying the hand.\n\n   - **Stack the orange block on top of the red block.** \n     - The red block is clear, enabling us to stack the orange block on top of it, partially achieving the goal state.\n\n5. Finalize the goal configuration:\n\n   - **Unstack the yellow block from the blue block.** \n     - The yellow block is clear enough due to its position on top of the blue block, making this valid. Hand holds the yellow block.\n\n   - **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block.**\n     - The orange block, having the red block indirectly below it, is clear on top from this angle, making it suitable for the stack finalization.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(stack yellow orange)",

        "answer": "1. **Unstack the orange block from the yellow block.** \n   - The orange block is clear and can be unstacked. This makes the orange block free to be moved. The action is valid as the hand is empty.\n   \n2. **Put down the orange block.** \n   - After unstacking, you're holding the orange block.

Therefore, you can unstack the orange block from the blue block. The hand becomes occupied, and the blue block becomes clear.\n   \n2. **Put down the orange block.**\n   - After unstacking, the orange block can be put down because it is in the hand. This action clears the hand.\n\n3. **Unstack the blue block from the red block.**\n   - Now, the blue block is clear and your hand is empty. You can unstack the blue block from the red block. The blue block goes into the hand, and the red block becomes clear.\n\n4. **Stack the blue block on top of the orange block.**\n   - With the blue block in hand and the orange block clear, you can stack the blue block onto the orange block. The action clears the hand and makes the orange block not clear.\n\n5. **Unstack the red block from the yellow block.**\n   - The red block can be unstacked from the yellow block because the red block is now clear. The action fills your hand with the red block.\n\n6. **Put down the red block.**\n   - You have the red block in hand, which can be put down onto an empty space on the table. This clears the hand.\n\n7. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block.**\n   - The blue block on top of the orange block can be unstacked now that your hand is empty and the block is clear. The action fills your hand with the blue block.\n\n8. **Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block.**\n   - Holding the blue block, you can stack it onto the yellow block, which is clear. This action clears your hand.\n\n9. **Pick up the orange block.**\n   - The orange block is clear and can be picked up because your hand is empty.\n\n10. **Stack the orange block on top of the red block.**\n    - The final move is to stack the held orange block on the now-clear red block, thus fulfilling one of the goal conditions.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack blue red)\n(stack blue orange)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)",

The goal is to rearrange so: the red block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is on top of the blue block.\n\n2. **Plan to Achieve the Goal:**\n\n   - **Unstack the red block from the orange block:**\n     Since the red block is clear and the hand is empty, the red block can be unstacked from the orange block.\n   \n   - **Put down the red block:**\n     After unstacking the red block, you need to put it down, making the hand empty and keeping the stack at the moment as yellow on orange.\n\n   - **Unstack the orange block from the yellow block:**\n     With the hand empty after putting down the red block, unstack the orange block from the yellow block as it is clear.\n\n   - **Stack the orange block on top of the red block:**\n     Now, holding the orange block, stack it on the red block as the red block is clear.\n\n   - **Pick up the yellow block:**\n     Since the yellow block is now clear and on the table, pick it up with the empty hand.\n\n   - **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block:**\n     Stack the yellow block on the blue block since the yellow block is clear and the blue block is also clear on the table.\n\n   - **Unstack the orange block from the red block:**\n     To reposition the orange block, unstack the orange block. This is feasible since the orange block is clear.\n\n   - **Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block:**\n     With the orange block in hand, stack it on the yellow block since the yellow block is clear.\n\n   - **Pick up the red block:**\n     Pick up the red block now available and clear.\n\n   - **Stack the red block on top of the orange block:**\n     Finally, put the red block on top of the orange block to complete the goal configuration.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(stack orange red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(unstack orange red)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)",

Plan steps:\n\n   - **Unstack the yellow block from the blue block**: This is possible because the yellow block is on top of the blue block and is clear. The action makes the blue block clear, and you're now holding the yellow block.\n\n   - **Stack the yellow block onto the red block**: This is necessary because the goal is to eventually have the yellow block on the orange block. The red block is clear, allowing you to place the yellow block on top, making the red block no longer clear and your hand empty.\n\n   - **Unstack the blue block from the orange block**: Now that the yellow block is not being held, and the hand is empty, you can unstack the blue block from the orange block because the blue block is clear. You are now holding the blue block.\n\n   - **Put down the blue block**: After unstacking the blue block and holding it, you can put it down on the table, ensuring your hand is empty and allowing further actions.\n\n   - **Unstack the yellow block from the red block**: Since the yellow block needs to be placed on the orange block, and the hand is now empty, you can unstack it from the red block (now clear after the blue block was put down), leaving you holding the yellow block, while the red block becomes clear again.\n\n   - **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block**: Now holding the yellow block and with the orange block clear, you can stack the yellow block onto the orange block achieving the goal.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack yellow blue)\n(stack yellow red)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack yellow red)\n(stack yellow orange)",
