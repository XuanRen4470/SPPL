To achieve this goal:\n   - The orange block must be clear to be moved and stacked on to the red block.\n   - Currently, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, so the yellow block must be removed.\n\n4. The first action should be to unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block:\n   - This can be done since the hand is empty and the yellow block is clear and stackable.\n\n5. Put down the yellow block:\n   - This action empties the hand. Now the yellow block is clear on the table.\n\n6.

        "answer": "1. The initial conditions state that the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, and the hand is empty. Additionally, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table, and the blue block is on the table.\n\n2. To achieve the goal, we need to move the orange block first because it is currently preventing us from accessing the yellow block directly. We will unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block. Since the orange block is clear and our hand is empty, we proceed with unstacking.\n\n3. After unstacking the orange block, we can put it down on the table as it is no longer needed at the top of any stack to achieve the goal.\n\n4. Next, we will unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block. This is allowable because the yellow block is clear and our hand is empty after putting down the orange block.\n\n5. We will put down the yellow block on the table because it needs to ultimately stack on top of another block, but we need to adjust the position of the red block first.\n\n6. Picking up the red block is the next necessary action since it is currently on the table and clear. Our goal is to place the red block on top of the orange block.\n\n7. With the red block in hand, we will stack it on top of the orange block, which aligns with part of our goal state.\n\n8. Now, we need to address the blue block by picking it up from the table. It is clear and meets our condition for stacking next.\n\n9. We proceed to stack the blue block on top of the red block as part of the goal.\n\n10.

        "answer": "To solve the problem step by step, let's break down the initial conditions, goals, and restrictions given in the problem. \n\n**Initial Conditions:**\n1. Red block is clear.\n2. Blue block is clear.\n3. Yellow block is clear.\n4. Hand is empty.\n5. Yellow block is on top of the orange block.\n6. Red block is on the table.\n7. Blue block is on the table.\n8. Orange block is on the table.\n\n**Goal:**\n1. The orange block is on top of the blue block.\n2. The yellow block is on top of the red block.\n\n**Plan Inference:**\n\n- **Step 1:** Look at the initial configuration. The yellow block is on top of the orange block, which is on the table. Our goal involves moving both the yellow and orange blocks to different positions.\n\n- **Step 2:** The yellow block is on top of the orange block. To move the yellow block, we need to first unstack it. Since the yellow block is clear, unstacking it from the orange block is possible since our hand is empty.\n\n  **Action:** Unstack the yellow block from the orange block. (unstack yellow orange)\n\n- **Step 3:** Now, we are holding the yellow block in our hand. The next goal is to place the yellow block on top of the red block. Since the red block is clear, we can perform this action.\n\n  **Action:** Stack the yellow block on top of the red block. (stack yellow red)\n\n- **Step 4:** The next task is to move the orange block onto the blue block. Currently, the orange block is clear. We need to pick it up first once our hands are empty. Since we placed the yellow block successfully, our hands are now empty.\n\n  **Action:** Pick up the orange block. (pick-up orange)\n\n- **Step 5:** Finally, with the orange block in hand, we need to stack it onto the blue block. Since the blue block is on the table and clear, we can perform this action.\n\n  **Action:** Stack the orange block on top of the blue block. (stack orange blue)\n\nFollowing the above steps, our inference leads to the series of actions:\n1. (unstack yellow orange)\n2. (stack yellow red)\n3. (pick-up orange)\n4.

        "answer": "Step by Step INFERENCE HERE\n\n1. We start with the initial condition where the hand is empty and can perform an action. The red block is clear and the red block is on top of the yellow block. The yellow block is clear as it is just below the red block. \n\n2. The unstack action involves removing the block which is on top. We unstack the red block from the yellow block. This ensures the red block is held in hand and the yellow block below becomes clear.\n\n3. Next, the red block is placed down onto the table to have the hand empty once again.\n\n4. The yellow block, which is currently clear, is unstacked from the orange block. The orange block is now clear below the yellow block.\n\n5. The yellow block is then put down on the table, ensuring it is no longer in hand, and the hand is cleared for the next action.\n\n6. Next, it is essential to stack the orange block onto the yellow block as per the final goal state. First, pick up the orange block.\n\n7.

        "answer": "Given the initial conditions, we need to meet the goal configuration with a series of valid actions.\n\n1. Initially, the blue block is clear, the orange block is on top of the red block, and the hand is empty. To start rearranging the blocks, the red block must be picked up. However, currently, the red block cannot be directly picked up due to the orange block on top of it.\n\n2. To make the red block clear, we first need to remove the orange block from on top of it. Thus, the first step is to unstack the orange block from the red block. Now, the hand is holding the orange block, and the red block is clear.\n\n3. Once the orange block has been unstacked, the next step is to put down the orange block to free the hand.\n\n4. Now, with the hand free, we can pick up the red block since it is clear after the previous action of unstacking.\n\n5. To achieve the desired state, we need the red block on top of the orange block. Therefore, we stack the red block on top of the orange block.\n\n6. The next goal is to place the yellow block on top of the red block. However, the yellow block has the blue block on top of it right now. Therefore, we must unstack the blue block from the yellow block, freeing the yellow block and making it clear. \n\n7. Once the blue block is removed, it needs to be put down to free the hand for the next action.\n\n8. Now, we can pick up the yellow block as it is now clear.\n\n9.

The goal requires us to have the yellow block on top of the orange block and the red block on top of the yellow block.\n\nStep 2: Since the goal involves moving the yellow block, we first need to unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block. At this point, the red block is clear and can be unstacked, leaving the yellow block clear.\n\nStep 3: Once the red block is unstacked, put it down on the table to have an empty hand to work with the yellow block.\n\nStep 4: With the red block set aside, pick up the yellow block since it is now clear and the hand is empty.\n\nStep 5: Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block to fulfill part of the goal of having the yellow block on top of the orange block.\n\nStep 6: With the yellow block in place, pick up the red block again.

        "answer": "1. Initial conditions include the blue block being clear, the orange block being on top of the red block, and the blue block on top of the yellow block. To stack the blue block on top of the orange block, it must first be removed from the yellow block. As such, we must first unstack the blue block from the yellow block.\n   \n2. According to the problem constraints, the hand is empty initially, and the blue block is clear (and on top of the yellow block). Since the blue is clear, we can unstack the blue block from the yellow block.\n\n3. Once the blue block is unstacked, it will be in hand and the hand will no longer be empty. The yellow block, after unstacking, becomes clear.\n\n4. After unstacking the blue block from the yellow block, the next step is to stack the blue block on top of the orange block, which is already clear as per the initial conditions.\n\n5. To stack the blue block on the orange block, we must ensure that the blue block is being held.

Currently, the orange block is on top of the yellow block. \n3. To achieve the goal, the current stack of \"orange on yellow\" needs to be inverted to \"yellow on orange.\"\n  \nSteps to achieve this:\n\n- **Unstack the orange block from the yellow block:** Since the orange block is on top of the yellow block and both blocks are clear, you can unstack the orange block from the yellow block. Now, the hand is holding the orange block, and the yellow block is clear.\n\n- **Put down the orange block:** With the hand holding the orange block, you put it down, making the hand empty. Now, the orange block is clear, and it rests on the table. The yellow block remains clear.\n\n- **Pick up the yellow block:** With the hand empty and the yellow block clear, you can pick up the yellow block.\n\n- **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block:** With the yellow block in hand and the orange block clear, the yellow block can be stacked on top of the orange block.

        "answer": "Step 1: The initial condition is \"the yellow block is clear,\" indicating it can be manipulated first. Therefore, the first action is to unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block because the yellow block is clear.\n\nStep 2: After unstacking the yellow block, the orange block becomes clear, and you are holding the yellow block. The next action is to put down the yellow block onto the table to free your hand for the subsequent actions.\n\nStep 3: The next clear block is the orange block because you previously unstacked the yellow block from it. Thus, unstack the orange block from on top of the red block.\n\nStep 4: Once the orange block is unstacked, put it down to make your hand empty.\n\nStep 5: Subsequently, the red block is now clear for unstacking because it is on top of the blue block. Unstack the red block from the blue block.\n\nStep 6: The goal is to stack the red block on the orange block. Since you are currently holding the red block, stack the red block on top of the orange block.

        "answer": "Step 1: Initial conditions are that the orange block is on top of the red block, the red block is on top of the blue block, and the orange block is clear. To make the red block clear to stack it onto the orange block, we must first make both the orange and red blocks not on any blocks. Start by unstacking the orange block from the red block. This requires the hand to be empty.\n\nStep 2: Once we unstack the orange block, place it down on the table so that the hand is empty again.\n\nStep 3: The red block is now clear, as the orange block has been removed from it. We next unstack the red block from the blue block. The hand needs to be empty for this action.\n\nStep 4: Once the red block is unstacked, put it down on the table to free the hand for further actions.\n\nStep 5: The current goal requires the red block on top of the orange block, the orange block on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block on top of the blue block. First, pick up the yellow block, which is on the table and clear.\n\nStep 6: Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block once it's picked up.

Given that the blue block is on top of the red block, we can unstack the blue block from the red block first.\n\nStep 2: Action: (unstack blue red) - Unstack the blue block from the red block. The blue block is now in hand.\n\nStep 3: Action: (put-down blue) - Put down the blue block on the table. The hand is empty again.\n\nStep 4: The red block is now clear. Since the red block is on top of the orange block, it can be unstacked. \n\nStep 5: Action: (unstack red orange) - Unstack the red block from the orange block. The red block is now in hand.\n\nStep 6: Our goal begins by placing the red block on top of the blue block, but the instructions do not include this step at this point, so there\u2019s a misalignment with the desired final state.\n\nStep 7: Action: Next, the instruction suggests to (stack red blue) - Incorrect placement if following goals explicitly as stated.\n\nStep 8: The instructions appear to encourage picking up the orange block next for placing it on top of the yellow block.\n\nStep 9: Action: (pick-up orange) - Pick up the orange block from the table.

This will make the blue block ready for the next actions.\n  \nStep 3: Execute and Sequence Actions\n1. Unstack the blue block from on top of the red block (leaves the red block on the yellow block)\n2. Put down the blue block on the table (frees the hand, makes the red block clear)\n3. Unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block (the red block is now clear)\n4. Stack the red block on the blue block (intermediate step, red is on blue)\n\nStep 4: Reevaluate Intermediate States and Continue\n- Now, yellow is on orange and clear as nothing changes while we rearrange the red and blue.\n- Red is on top of the blue and needs to change to meet the goal. To proceed:\n\n5. Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block (yellow becomes held)\n6. Put down the yellow block (on the table) (frees the hand)\n7.

The goal requires the orange block to be on top of the yellow block and the blue block on top of the orange block. Therefore, the first action is to unstack the orange block from the yellow block because we need to access each block separately to rearrange them.\n\nStep 2: After unstacking the orange block, the hand is not empty. The next logical step is to put down the orange block on the table to clear the hand for further actions.\n\nStep 3: The next action should be unstacking the yellow block from the blue block. This is necessary because we need the yellow block to be clear for further stacking operations.\n\nStep 4: After unstacking the yellow block, place it on the table to make the hand empty again.\n\nStep 5: With the hand empty, pick up the orange block from the table since it needs to be stacked on top of the yellow block as per the goal.\n\nStep 6: Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block. This aligns with part of the goal, which requires the orange on yellow.\n\nStep 7: Next, we need to unstack the blue block from the red block.

        "answer": "Step 1: Unstack Red from Orange  \n- The initial condition states that the red block is on top of the orange block. To achieve the goal of having the red block on the table and to eventually stack other blocks in the desired sequence, we must first unstack the red block from the orange block.\n\nStep 2: Put Down Red  \n- Once the red block is unstacked, the hand will be holding the red block. We need to put down the red block on the table to clear the hand for other operations and to maintain the condition that the red block is on the table.\n\nStep 3: Pick Up Yellow  \n- The yellow block is on the table and is clear, so we can pick it up. We need to stack it later on the red block to form part of the final stack.\n\nStep 4: Stack Yellow on Red  \n- Now, we stack the yellow block on top of the red block, as the red block is on the table and clear. This satisfies part of the final goal condition.\n\nStep 5: Unstack Orange from Blue  \n- Next, we unstack the orange block from the blue block. This is necessary because the blue block must eventually be the topmost block, and we need the orange block available to stack on yellow.\n\nStep 6: Stack Orange on Yellow  \n- With the orange block unstacked and the yellow block on the red block, we can now stack the orange block on top of the yellow block, as desired in the goal configuration.\n\nStep 7: Pick Up Blue  \n- The blue block, being now clear after unstacking the orange block from it, can be picked up.\n\nStep 8: Stack Blue on Orange  \n- Finally, the blue block is stacked on top of the orange block, completing the necessary arrangement where the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange is on top of the yellow, and the yellow is on top of the red block.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack red orange)  \n(put-down red)  \n(pick-up yellow)  \n(stack yellow red)  \n(unstack orange blue)  \n(stack orange yellow)  \n(pick-up blue)  \n(stack blue orange)",

Orange block is on the table.\n\n**Goal:**\n1. Orange block is on top of the red block.\n2. Yellow block is on top of the blue block.\n\nNow, I'll explain how we manipulate the blocks:\n\n1. **Unstack Yellow from Blue**: We start by unstacking the yellow block from the blue block to clear the blue block so it can be moved subsequently.\n   \n2. **Stack Yellow on Red**: We stack the yellow block on the clear red block which is directly on the table for a temporary move to clear blue further.\n   \n3. **Unstack Blue from Orange**: Next, we unstack the blue block from the orange block so that we can use the orange block for another stack.\n   \n4. **Put Down Blue on Table**: We then put down the blue block back on the table to ensure the blue block remains clear while we continue with other maneuvers.\n   \n5. **Unstack Yellow from Red**: After that, unstack the yellow block from the red block, freeing the red so the orange block can be stacked on it.\n   \n6. **Stack Yellow on Blue**: Proceed by stacking the yellow block back on top of the blue block, reestablishing part of the final condition.\n   \n7. **Pick Up Orange**: Now, we pick up the orange block to clear the space, preparing it for the desired final stack.\n   \n8. **Stack Orange on Red**: Lastly, stack the orange block on the red block which completes the second part of the final goal.\n\nIn each step it is made sure that all the conditions and restrictions given are respected.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack yellow blue)  \n(stack yellow red)  \n(unstack blue orange)  \n(put-down blue)  \n(unstack yellow red)  \n(stack yellow blue)  \n(pick-up orange)  \n(stack orange red)  ",

After putting down the blue block, we have a situation where the orange block is on top of the yellow block and the red block is still clear and on the table.\n\n6.

The first action has to be unstacking the overlapping blocks according to the initial setup descriptions and goal intentions. The yellow block, being clear and initially on the table, will remain on the table for future steps.\n  \n   To achieve the goal, start by unstacking the red block from the orange block. This will help facilitate the dual goal of stacking the red block on top of the blue and subsequently stacking the orange block on top of the red.\n\n2. Once the red block is clear and held, place the red block on the blue block \u2014 achieving one aspect of the goal.\n\n3. With the hand empty again, pick up the orange block which is now clear and place it on top of the red block (now facilitating the red being on blue and orange being on red).\n\n4.

Our goal is to stack so that the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, and the orange block is on top of the red block.\n\n2. Since the yellow block is on top of the blue block, we must unstack it. The yellow block is clear, and the hand is empty, so we can unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block.

The blue block is on top of the red block, and we need to rearrange them. The blue block is clear, so we unstack the blue block from the red block. We now hold the blue block.\n\n5. Our next step is to stack the blue block onto the yellow block according to our desired goal. The yellow block is on the table and clear, so we stack the blue block on top of the yellow block.

Because the blue block is clear and on top of the red block, the first action we can perform is unstacking the blue block from the red block.\n2. The second action is to put down the blue block on the table, which will make the blue block clear and free our hand.\n3.

The goal is to rearrange blocks so that the red block is on top of the blue block, the orange block is on top of the red block, and the yellow block is on top of the orange block.\n\n3. (unstack blue red): Since the blue block is on top of the red block and the red block is not the intended base in the final configuration, it needs to be unstacked.

Now, blue is not clear anymore, but it's in the desired final position supporting the red block.\n\n7.

        "answer": "Step 1: The initial conditions state that the yellow block is on top of the red block, and the hand is empty.

This maintains compliance with the rule that the hand must be empty to perform other actions.\n\nStep 3: The next goal is to stack the orange block on top of the red block. Since the orange block is already on the table and clear, the next action is to pick up the orange block.\n\nStep 4: Now, stack the orange block on top of the red block. The red block is clear after the yellow block was unstacked and is the new base.\n\nStep 5: With the blue block being clear and on the table, the next goal is to stack it on top of the currently structured (orange block on top of the red block).

According to the plan, the first step is to \"unstack orange red.\" Since the orange block is on top of the red block and clear, this action is valid. Perform the action: unstack the orange block from the red block. Now, orange is held, hand is no longer empty.\n3. Next, the plan indicates to \"stack orange yellow.\" The yellow block is clear and orange is held, so stack the orange block on top of the yellow block. Now, hand is empty, and orange is no longer clear.\n4. The plan continues with \"pick-up red.\" The red block is on the table and clear, so pick it up. Now, the red block is held and the hand is not empty.\n5. The next step is \"stack red blue.\" Since the blue block is clear, stacking the red block on top of the blue block is possible. Now the red is no longer held and not clear, and the hand becomes empty.\n6. The next action states \"unstack orange yellow.\" The orange is on top of the yellow and because it was stacked there earlier, this action is valid. The result is that orange is held, yellow becomes clear.\n7. Following the plan, we \"stack orange red.\" With orange held and the red face-up (because it's no longer clear but at the top of its stack), stack orange on top of it.

        "answer": "To solve this problem step by step, we need to transform the initial condition to the goal condition using the allowed actions while adhering to the restrictions. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions Recap:**\n   - Orange block is clear.\n   - Hand is empty.\n   - Blue block is on top of the Red block.\n   - Orange block is on top of the Yellow block.\n   - Yellow block is on top of the Blue block.\n   - Red block is on the table.\n\n2. **Goal Conditions Recap:**\n   - Red block is on top of the Blue block.\n   - Orange block is on top of the Yellow block.\n   - Yellow block is on top of the Red block.\n\n3. **Steps to Achieve the Goal:**\n\n   - Start with the orange block, which is already on top of the yellow block and is clear, so:\n     1. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block**.\n\n   - Now the orange block is held in hand and the yellow block is clear. We need to put down the orange block:\n     2. **Put down the orange block** on the table.\n\n   - Now, let's deal with the stacking order at the bottom. The yellow block is clear, but it's on top of the blue block. We need to clear the blue block, so:\n     3. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block**. Now, the yellow block is held in hand.\n\n   - To progress towards the goal, stack the yellow block on top of the orange block:\n     4. **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block**. Now, the orange block is no longer clear.\n\n   - Next step is to make progress on rearranging for the goal condition. The blue block is currently on top of the red block. We need to move the blue block:\n     5. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the red block**.\n\n   - The blue block is now held. We need to clear the hand to manipulate the red block:\n     6. **Put down the blue block**.\n\n   - Next, we need to move the red block to its goal position. Pick it up:\n     7. **Pick up the red block**.\n\n   - Stack the red block on top of the blue block:\n     8. **Stack the red block on top of the blue block**.\n\n   - Now the structure with the red block is correct, but the yellow stack is wrong. The yellow block is on the orange, and needs to get above the red block. Unstack it:\n     9. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block**.\n\n   - Place the yellow block onto the right position:\n     10. **Stack the yellow block on top of the red block**.\n\n   - Lastly, we need to return the orange block to be on top of the newly formed stack without disturbing the correct order:\n     11. **Pick up the orange block** from the table.\n\n   - And place the orange block back on top of the yellow block:\n     12. **Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block**.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure we reach the goal condition successfully with adherence to all given restrictions and initial conditions.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)",

        "answer": "Given the initial conditions and the actions allowed, let's plan the steps needed to achieve the goal state:\n\n1. Start with the situation where all blocks are on the table and clear: red, blue, orange, and yellow. The hand is empty.\n\n2. To achieve the goal where the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, and the orange block is on top of the red block, we need to follow these steps:\n\n3. Pick up the blue block from the table. The blue block is clear and the hand is empty, so this action is possible.\n\n4. Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block. The yellow block is clear, so this action can be done, leaving the hand empty and making the blue block no longer clear.\n\n5. Pick up the red block from the table. The red block is clear and the hand is empty, which makes this action possible.\n\n6. Stack the red block on top of the blue block. The blue block is now clear, allowing this action. The hand becomes empty, and the blue block is no longer clear.\n\n7. Pick up the orange block from the table. The orange block is clear and the hand is empty, so this action is valid.\n\n8. Stack the orange block on top of the red block. The red block is now clear, which permits this action. The hand is empty again, and the red block becomes non-clear.\n\nFollowing these steps achieves the desired final arrangement of blocks.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up blue) (stack blue yellow) (pick-up red) (stack red blue) (pick-up orange) (stack orange red)",

To move the orange block, it has to be unstacked. Since it is already clear (nothing on top of it), the action \"unstack orange yellow\" can be performed:\n   - Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block.

Initially, the yellow block is on top of the red block, which is on top of the blue block, and both the blue block and orange block are clear on the table.\n\n2. To achieve the goal where the red block is on top of the orange block and the yellow block is on top of the blue block, we need to move the blocks accordingly.\n\n3. First, unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block to make the red block clear. \n   - This action is possible because the yellow block is clear, and the hand is empty.\n\n4. Then, put down the yellow block on the table to free the hand for the next actions.\n\n5. After that, unstack the red block from on top of the blue block, since the red block is now clear and the hand is empty again.\n\n6. Next, stack the red block on top of the orange block.\n   - The orange block is clear, and you are holding the red block, so this stacking action is allowed.\n\n7.

Now, the blue block is clear (though still on the yellow block), so perform the action \"unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block.\" The blue block is now being held in the hand.\n\n6. We wish to place the blue block on top of the red block (from the new goal), so perform \"stack the blue block on top of the red block.\" Now, the blue block is no longer clear and the hand is empty.\n\n7. To stack the orange block on top of the blue block (as per our finalized goal configuration), we pick up the orange block again with \"pick up the orange block.\"\n\n8. With the orange block in hand, perform \"stack the orange block on top of the blue block.\" The orange block is now not clear, and the blue block is also not clear anymore.\n\n9. The yellow block is clear and on the table, and we need it on top of the orange block (final realization goal). So, \"pick up the yellow block.\"\n\n10.

Pick it up since we need to relocate it per the goal.\n\n8. **Stack Orange on Yellow:**\n   - Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block on the table, fulfilling the goal that orange is atop yellow.\n\n---\n\nBy following the above steps and reasoning, you achieve both parts of the goal, ensuring all actions respect the initial conditions and the restrictions of the task.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack yellow red)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)",

        "answer": "1. The initial state has the red block on top of the yellow block and the blue block on top of the orange block. The orange block and yellow block are on the table, and my hand is empty.\n\n2. The first goal is to have the red block on top of the orange block. To achieve this, I need to first unstack the red block from the yellow block because the red block needs to be on top of a different stack.\n\n3. To unstack the red block from the yellow block, it must be clear, which is already the case. Therefore, I unstack the red block from the yellow block.\n\n4. After unstacking, I am holding the red block. I need to put it down to free my hand. I will put down the red block on the table.\n\n5. The next step is to place the blue block on top of the yellow block. Currently, the blue block is on top of the orange block. I need to unstack the blue block from the orange block.\n\n6. Since the blue block is clear, I can unstack it from the orange block. I do so and now I am holding the blue block.\n\n7. Now that I am holding the blue block, I can stack it on top of the clear yellow block. I stack the blue block on top of the yellow block.\n\n8. With the blue block successfully stacked on the yellow block, I now need the orange block to be on top of the blue block. But currently, the orange block is clear and on the table.\n\n9. I pick up the orange block from the table.\n\n10. I stack the orange block on top of the clear blue block.\n\n11. Finally, the red block needs to be on top of the orange block.

I stack the red block on top of the orange block.\n\nThe goal state is now achieved with the red block on top of the orange block, the blue block on top of the yellow block, and the orange block on top of the blue block.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack red yellow) \n(put-down red) \n(unstack blue orange) \n(stack blue yellow) \n(pick-up orange) \n(stack orange blue) \n(pick-up red) \n(stack red orange)",

First, to achieve the red block on top of the orange block, we need to unstack the red block from the yellow block. This is possible because the red block is clear, and our hand is empty.\n\n4. After unstacking the red block, we need to put it down temporarily to allow us to move it later. This keeps our hand free.\n\n5. Next, we pick up the red block again from the table to move it onto the orange block. The orange block is already clear and on the table, allowing us to stack red onto it.\n\n6. Now that the red block is on the orange block, we turn our focus to the blue block.\n\n7. The blue block needs to be stacked on top of the yellow block.

        "answer": "Step 1: Start with the initial condition. We have:\n- Blue block is clear and on top of the yellow block.\n- Orange block is clear and on top of the red block.\n- Hand is empty.\n\nStep 2: Our goal is to have the orange block on top of the yellow block and the yellow block on top of the blue block. To achieve this, we need to rearrange the blocks accordingly.\n\nStep 3: Since the blue block is on top of the yellow block and is clear, we can unstack it.\nAction: (unstack blue yellow)\n\nStep 4: Place the blue block on the table because we need the yellow block to be movable to place it on top of the blue block later.\nAction: (put-down blue)\n\nStep 5: With the hand empty, pick up the yellow block from the table.\nAction: (pick-up yellow)\n\nStep 6: Stack the yellow block onto the blue block to achieve part of the goal.\nAction: (stack yellow blue)\n\nStep 7: Unstack the orange block from the red block since the orange block needs to be moved to the yellow block.\nAction: (unstack orange red)\n\nStep 8: Finally, stack the orange block on top of the yellow block to reach the desired configuration.\nAction: (stack orange yellow)\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue yellow) (put-down blue) (pick-up yellow) (stack yellow blue) (unstack orange red) (stack orange yellow)",
