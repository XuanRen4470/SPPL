Unstack the orange block from the yellow block\n2. Put down the orange block (it's no longer needed for the goal state)\n3. Unstack the yellow block from the blue block\n4. The plan suggests stacking yellow on orange, but this isn't necessary for our goal\n5. Unstack the blue block from the red block\n6. Put down the blue block temporarily\n7. Unstack the yellow block from the orange block (this step is unnecessary as we already unstacked yellow earlier)\n8. Stack the yellow block on the red block (this achieves part of our goal)\n9.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of stacking the blocks in the order red on blue, blue on orange, and orange on yellow, we need to start from the bottom of the desired stack and work our way up. \n\nFirst, we need to pick up the orange block and stack it on the yellow block. This forms the base of our desired stack.\n\nNext, we'll pick up the blue block and stack it on top of the orange block.\n\nFinally, we'll pick up the red block and stack it on top of the blue block.\n\nThis approach minimizes the number of moves and, consequently, the time taken to achieve the goal.\n\nEach action (pick up and stack) takes 1 minute, so the total time for this plan will be 6 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)",
