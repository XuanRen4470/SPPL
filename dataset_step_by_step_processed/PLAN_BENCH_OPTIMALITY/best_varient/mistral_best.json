        "answer": "To achieve the goal state where the red block is on top of the orange block and the blue block is on top of the red block, we need to carefully rearrange the blocks while following the given restrictions. Let's break down the plan step by step:\n\n1. Unstack the orange block from the blue block:\n   This is necessary because the orange block is currently on top of the blue block, and we need to free both of these blocks to achieve our goal state.\n\n2. Put down the orange block:\n   After unstacking, we need to put down the orange block to free our hand. This follows the rule that we can only hold one block at a time.\n\n3. Pick up the red block:\n   The red block is currently on the table and clear, so we can pick it up. We need to move the red block to stack it on the orange block.\n\n4. Stack the red block on the orange block:\n   This achieves the first part of our goal state, where the red block needs to be on top of the orange block.\n\n5. Unstack the blue block from the yellow block:\n   The blue block is currently on top of the yellow block, but we need it to be on top of the red block in our final state.\n\n6. Stack the blue block on the red block:\n   This completes our goal state, with the blue block on top of the red block, which is on top of the orange block.\n\nThis plan efficiently rearranges the blocks to achieve the desired configuration while adhering to all the given restrictions.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal state from the given initial conditions, we need to carefully rearrange the blocks while following the rules. Here's a step-by-step plan with explanations:\n\n1. (unstack yellow orange)\n   We start by unstacking the yellow block from the orange block. This is necessary because we need to rearrange the stack and the yellow block is currently on top.\n\n2. (stack yellow blue)\n   We then stack the yellow block on the blue block. This temporary move frees up the orange block and allows us to continue rearranging.\n\n3. (unstack orange red)\n   Now we can unstack the orange block from the red block. This is crucial because in the final state, orange needs to be on the table and red needs to be under yellow.\n\n4. (put-down orange)\n   We put the orange block down on the table. This sets up the base for the blue block to be stacked on later.\n\n5. (unstack yellow blue)\n   We unstack the yellow block from the blue block. This temporary arrangement is no longer needed, and we need the yellow block free to stack on red.\n\n6. (stack yellow red)\n   We stack the yellow block on the red block. This achieves part of our goal state where yellow needs to be on top of red.\n\n7. (pick-up blue)\n   We pick up the blue block from the table. This is the final piece we need to move to complete the goal state.\n\n8. (stack blue orange)\n   Finally, we stack the blue block on top of the orange block, completing our goal state.\n\nThis plan ensures that at each step, we're following the rules (only moving one block at a time, only moving clear blocks, etc.) while progressively working towards the final configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(unstack orange red)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)",

Let's break down the plan step by step:\n\n1. (unstack blue yellow)\n   We start by unstacking the blue block from the yellow block. This is necessary because the blue block needs to be moved to the red block. The blue block is clear and on top of the yellow block, so this action is allowed.\n\n2. (stack blue red)\n   Now that we're holding the blue block, we can stack it on top of the red block. The red block is clear and on the table, so this action is permitted. This achieves the first part of our goal.\n\n3. (unstack yellow orange)\n   We need to move the yellow block to access the orange block. The yellow block is clear and on top of the orange block, so we can unstack it.\n\n4. (put-down yellow)\n   We put down the yellow block because we don't need it for our goal state. This frees up our hand for the next action.\n\n5. (pick-up orange)\n   Now that the orange block is clear and on the table, we can pick it up.

        "answer": "Let's break down the plan step-by-step, considering the initial conditions and the goal:\n\n1. (unstack red blue)\n   We start by unstacking the red block from the blue block. This is necessary because we need to rearrange the entire stack.\n\n2. (put-down red)\n   After unstacking, we put down the red block to free our hand. This allows us to manipulate other blocks.\n\n3. (unstack blue orange)\n   Now we unstack the blue block from the orange block. This is crucial because in the final configuration, blue needs to be at the bottom with yellow on top of it.\n\n4. (put-down blue)\n   We put down the blue block to free our hand again and to prepare it for its final position.\n\n5. (pick-up yellow)\n   We pick up the yellow block, which is currently on the table, as it needs to be placed on top of the blue block in the final configuration.\n\n6. (stack yellow blue)\n   We stack the yellow block on top of the blue block, which is the first step in achieving our final goal state.\n\n7. (pick-up red)\n   We pick up the red block, which we previously put down, as it needs to go on top of the yellow block.\n\n8. (stack red yellow)\n   We stack the red block on top of the yellow block, continuing to build our desired configuration.\n\n9. (pick-up orange)\n   Finally, we pick up the orange block, which is the last piece needed to complete our goal state.\n\n10. (stack orange red)\n    We stack the orange block on top of the red block, completing our desired configuration.\n\nThis plan efficiently rearranges the blocks from the initial state to the goal state while adhering to all the given restrictions.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the blue block on top of the orange block, and the orange block on top of the yellow block, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.

The orange block is clear and on top of the red block, so this action is allowed.\n\n2. (stack orange yellow)\n   Next, we stack the orange block on top of the yellow block. This achieves part of our goal state. The yellow block is clear and on the table, so we can stack onto it. Our hand is holding the orange block from the previous action, so we can perform this stack.\n\n3. (pick-up blue)\n   Now we need to pick up the blue block. It's clear and on the table, so we can pick it up. Our hand is empty after the previous stacking action, allowing us to perform this pick-up.\n\n4. (stack blue orange)\n   Finally, we stack the blue block on top of the orange block. This completes our goal state. The orange block is clear (on top of yellow), and we're holding the blue block, so this action is allowed.\n\nThis plan efficiently achieves the goal state while adhering to all the given restrictions and initial conditions.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange red)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)",
