    "answer": "To achieve the goal given, we need to analyze the steps based on the current conditions and the sequence of blocks as mentioned. Let's break down the tasks into actionable steps while ensuring we respect all the conditions and restrictions given in the problem.\n\n### Initial Conditions:\n- Blue block is clear.\n- Hand is empty.\n- Blue block is on top of Orange block.\n- Orange block is on top of Yellow block.\n- Yellow block is on top of Red block.\n- Red block is on the table.\n\n### Goal:\n- Red block is on top of the Orange block.\n- Yellow block is on top of the Red block.\n\n### Inference and Plan:\n1. **Unstack Blue from on top of Orange**: Since Blue is clear, we unstack Blue from Orange. (1 minute)\n2. **Put down Blue**: This makes hand empty allowing us to proceed with unstacking other blocks. (1 minute)\n3. **Unstack Orange from on top of Yellow**: Now, Orange is clear, so we unstack it from Yellow. (1 minute)\n4. **Put down Orange**: Place it on the table to make the hand empty. (1 minute)\n5. **Unstack Yellow from on top of Red**: With Yellow now clear, we unstack it from the Red block. (1 minute)\n6. **Stack Yellow on top of Blue**: Temporarily stack Yellow on Blue to free up Red for repositioning (1 minute).\n7. **Pick up Red**: With our hand empty, we pick up the Red block. (1 minute)\n8. **Stack Red on top of Orange**: Place Red on Orange to partially achieve the goal. (1 minute)\n9. **Unstack Yellow from on top of Blue**: With Yellow being the only block on the Blue, we unstack it to reposition it properly in the final configuration. (1 minute)\n10. **Stack Yellow on top of Red**: Complete the goal by placing Yellow on top of Red.

This action frees up the orange block eventually and satisfies our first condition that red should be clear. \n  - Action: (unstack red blue)\n\n- **Step 2**: After unstacking the red block, we put it down to keep the hand empty for the next actions and because in the final state, the orange block goes on top of it. \n  - Action: (put-down red)\n\n- **Step 3**: Next, we need to free the yellow block to be ultimately stacked back on top of the blue block, so we should unstack the blue block from the yellow block. \n  - Action: (unstack blue yellow)\n\n- **Step 4**: After unstacking the blue block, put it down to make the hand free for further moves. This also allows us later to stack yellow on it as per the goal.\n  - Action: (put-down blue)\n\n- **Step 5**: Unstack the yellow block from the orange block, as the next step is to stack the yellow block on the blue block.\n  - Action: (unstack yellow orange)\n\n- **Step 6**: Stack the yellow block on top of the already put-down blue block.\n  - Action: (stack yellow blue)\n\n- **Step 7**: Pick up the orange block so it can be stacked on top of the red block to achieve the final condition in the goal.\n  - Action: (pick-up orange)\n\n- **Step 8**: Finally, stack the orange block on top of the red block to meet the last part of the goal where the orange block is on the red block.\n  - Action: (stack orange red)\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)",

    "answer": "To solve this problem, let's work through the steps required to achieve the goal with minimal time:\n\n1. Start with initial conditions where the red block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on the table, and the yellow block is on the table.\n\n2. The goals are to:\n   - Have the blue block on top of the yellow block.\n   - Have the orange block on top of the red block.\n   - Have the yellow block on top of the orange block.\n\nFollowing these objectives, we can outline our plan:\n\n- **Unstack red from blue**: This frees the blue block.\n- **Put down red block**: You need to put down the red block to free your hand for the next operation.\n- **Pick up the orange block**: Now, with the red block down, we can pick up orange, as it is initially clear and on the table.\n- **Stack orange on red**: Place orange on the red block to satisfy the goal of orange being on red.\n- **Unstack blue from yellow**: This clears the yellow block as it enables further manipulation according to the goal.\n- **Put down blue block**: This operation will free the hand.\n- **Pick up the yellow block**: Now, we pick up yellow as it is cleared after moving blue.\n- **Stack yellow on orange**: This enables the yellow block to temporarily be on orange, satisfying one of the sub-goals.\n- **Pick up the blue block**: Now, with yellow in place, the last action is possible.\n- **Stack blue on yellow**: Finally, placing blue directly on the freshly stacked yellow block meets all goals as per the objective of having blue on yellow.\n\nAfter breaking down the tasks systematically, we ensure that each required condition is met, and the time required should match the described processes, which are each 1-minute tasks.\n\nFinal Answer: ((unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue yellow)\n)",

    "answer": "### Step by Step Inference\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - Red block is on top of the yellow block.\n   - Orange block is on top of the blue block.\n   - Our goal is to have the red block on top of the yellow block, which itself is on top of the orange block.\n   \n2. **Evaluate Current State and Actions Needed:**\n   - Currently, the red block is already on top of the yellow block, but we need to rearrange the yellow block.\n   - To achieve the goal, we need to move the yellow block on top of the orange block first, and then place the red block on the yellow block again.\n\n3. **Step 1: Unstack Red Block:**\n   - **Action:** Unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block.\n   - **Reasoning:** The red block is on top of the yellow block. To move the yellow block, we first need to remove the red block, which makes the yellow block clear.\n\n4. **Step 2: Put Down Red Block:**\n   - **Action:** Put down the red block on the table.\n   - **Reasoning:** Once the red block is removed, the hand is occupied. We need to place the red block down to proceed with moving the yellow block.\n\n5. **Step 3: Pick Up Yellow Block:**\n   - **Action:** Pick up the yellow block.\n   - **Reasoning:** Now that the yellow block is clear, we can pick it up to place it on top of the orange block.\n\n6. **Step 4: Stack Yellow Block on Orange Block:**\n   - **Action:** Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block.\n   - **Reasoning:** Placing the yellow block on the orange block aligns with our goal of having the yellow block on top of the orange block.\n\n7. **Step 5: Pick Up Red Block:**\n   - **Action:** Pick up the red block.\n   - **Reasoning:** With the yellow block in its correct position, we now pick the red block up from the table.\n\n8. **Step 6: Stack Red Block on Yellow Block:**\n   - **Action:** Stack the red block on top of the yellow block.\n   - **Reasoning:** This completes the final stack arrangement according to the goal, with the red block on top of the yellow block.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```\n(unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red yellow)\n```",

The orange block is on top of the blue block and is clear. Unstack the orange block from the blue block, which takes 1 minute.\n2. Put down the orange block on an available space on the table, which takes 1 minute. (Note: This allows us to use both hands for future moves if needed, but in this case, it's actually part of the unnecessary actions as no other moves require the table as intermediary.)\n3. Pick up the orange block, which takes 1 minute. (This step need not physically occur as the next operation is to directly stack it since it's already in hands after unstacking.)\n4. Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block, which takes 1 minute.\n\n**Step 5: Ensure Minimization of Time**\n- Verify the actions are minimal: The series of unstacking the orange block and directly stacking it onto the yellow block, making intermediate actions unnecessary. Thus the plan is:\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack orange blue)\n(stack orange yellow)",

    "answer": "Step by Step INFERENCE HERE:\n\n1. The initial conditions state that the red block is on top of the yellow block and the blue block is on top of the orange block. The red block is clear, and we need to make space for the yellow block to eventually be on top of the blue block.\n\n2. Since the blue block is already on top of the orange block as required by the goal, we don't need to move the blue block or worry about the orange block. We only need to focus on freeing and positioning the yellow block correctly.\n\n3. First, we need to unstack the red block from the yellow block. This will require:\n   - Unstacking the red block from the yellow block. (1 minute)\n\n4. After unstacking, we need to put down the red block because the goal does not require the red block to be in any specific position, and our task is to move the yellow block:\n   - Put down the red block. (1 minute)\n\n5. Now that the yellow block is clear, we can pick it up:\n   - Pick up the yellow block. (1 minute)\n\n6. The only step left is to stack the yellow block on top of the blue block to fulfill the final requirement of the goal:\n   - Stack the yellow block on the blue block. (1 minute)\n\nThe total time taken to execute the plan is 4 minutes, which satisfies the conditions and achieves the desired goal.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red yellow) (put-down red) (pick-up yellow) (stack yellow blue)",

    "answer": "To solve the problem and achieve the goal, we need to transform the initial configuration of blocks to the desired configuration by performing a sequence of actions.

The red block is now in hand.\n\n   - **Step 2:** The red block is currently held, but for future actions, we need the hand to be empty.\n     - Action: Put down the red block.\n     - Reason: This action frees up the hand to perform the next required steps on the blue block.\n\n   - **Step 3:** With the red block put down and the hand empty, we need to move the blue block from on top of the yellow block to achieve the goal configuration.\n     - Action: Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block.\n     - Reason: The blue block is inaccessible when it is on top of the yellow block, so we unstack it. The blue block is now in hand.\n\n   - **Step 4:** To achieve the goal of having the blue block on top of the red block, we need to place the blue block on the red block.\n     - Action: Stack the blue block on top of the red block.\n     - Reason: This achieves the goal configuration with the blue on top of the red block.

We start with the initial conditions as described.\n\n**Initial conditions:**\n- The red block is clear.\n- The yellow block is clear.\n- The hand is empty.\n- The red block is on top of the orange block.\n- The orange block is on top of the blue block.\n- The blue block is on the table.\n- The yellow block is on the table.\n\n**Goal conditions:**\n- The red block is on top of the blue block.\n- The blue block is on top of the yellow block.\n- The yellow block is on top of the orange block.\n\n**Step-by-step inference:**\n\n1. **Unstack the red block from on top of the orange block**: Since the red block is clear and on top of the orange block, unstack the red block. This takes 1 minute.\n2. **Put down the red block**: With the red block in hand, put it down on the table to free up the hand. This takes 1 minute.\n3. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block**: The orange block is clear and on top of the blue block. Unstack the orange block. This takes 1 minute.\n4. **Put down the orange block**: With the orange block in hand, put it down to free up the hand. This takes 1 minute.\n5. **Pick up the yellow block**: The yellow block is clear on the table. Pick it up. This takes 1 minute.\n6. **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block**: Stack the yellow block on the now-clear orange block. This takes 1 minute.\n7. **Pick up the blue block**: The blue block is clear on the table. Pick it up. This takes 1 minute.\n8. **Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block**: Stack the blue block on the now-clear yellow block. This takes 1 minute.\n9. **Pick up the red block**: The red block is clear on the table. Pick it up. This takes 1 minute.\n10. **Stack the red block on top of the blue block**: Stack the red block on the now-clear blue block. This takes 1 minute.\n\nThe steps described minimize movement and ensure each block is correctly stacked according to the goal condition.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n(unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)",

The Yellow block is on the table and clear. Hand is empty.\n2. **Goal**: Have the Orange block on top of the Red block.\n3. **First Action - Unstack Blue from Red**: Since the Blue block is clear, we can unstack it from the Red block. Now the Blue block is being held in hand. This action takes 1 minute.\n4. **Second Action - Put Down Blue**: Since the hand is not empty and holding the Blue block, place it down onto the table. This action takes 1 minute, and the hand becomes empty.\n5. **Third Action - Unstack Red from Orange**: The Red block is clear (since we removed the Blue block), so unstack it from the Orange block. The Red block is now held in hand. This action takes 1 minute.\n6. **Fourth Action - Put Down Red**: Put down the Red block onto the table. This action takes 1 minute, and the hand becomes empty.\n7. **Fifth Action - Pick Up Orange**: Now the Orange block is clear. Pick up the Orange block. This action takes 1 minute.\n8. **Sixth Action - Stack Orange on Red**: Stack the Orange block, which is held by hand, on top of the Red block, which is clear and on the table.

This satisfies the condition of being able to pick up the orange block, as the hand is empty.\n   \n   - **Step 2:** After unstacking, the orange block is being held. The next logical action is to put down the orange block to free the hand for the following actions, considering the destination doesn't affect the final goal.\n\n   - **Step 3:** Now, the blue block becomes clear after the orange block is put down. The next step is to unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block because the hand is empty and the blue block is clear. \n\n   - **Step 4:** Now, the blue block is being held. We stack the blue block on top of the orange block as per the goal condition. \n\n   - **Step 5:** The hand is now free again, and we need the yellow block on top of the blue block.

This makes the red block clear, allows us to hold the orange block, and takes 1 minute.\n\n4. **Action 2**: With the orange block in hand, put down the orange block on the table to empty the hand and clear the red block for further operations. This takes 1 minute.\n\n5. **Action 3**: Now, the red block is clear and can be unstacked from the yellow block. Unstack the red block to hold it and clear the yellow block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n6. **Action 4**: Put down the red block on the table to empty the hand, which clears it for the next operations. This will take an additional 1 minute.\n\n7. **Action 5**: With the yellow block now clear, unstack the yellow block from the blue block, hold the yellow block in hand, and ensure the blue block is clear. This operation will take 1 minute.\n\n8. **Action 6**: Put down the yellow block on the table to free up the hand for the last essential operations. This takes 1 minute.\n\n9. **Action 7**: Pick up the clear blue block from the table, so it's ready to be stacked on the yellow block. This action costs 1 minute.\n\n10. **Action 8**: Finally, stack the blue block on top of the now-clear yellow block. The blue block should now be on top of the yellow block, achieving the set goal.

Let's infer the plan step by step.\n\n### Initial Conditions:\n- `The red block` is clear and on the table.\n- `The yellow block` is clear and on top of the blue block.\n- `The blue block` is on top of the orange block.\n- `The orange block` is on the table.\n- `The hand is empty`.\n\n### Goal:\n- `The red block` is on top of the blue block.\n- `The blue block` is on top of the orange block.\n- `The yellow block` is on top of the red block.\n\n1. **Unstack the yellow block from the blue block:**\n   - The yellow block is clear, so we can unstack it.\n   - *Action: (unstack yellow blue)*\n   - Now, we are holding the yellow block.\n\n2. **Put down the yellow block:**\n   - The yellow block needs to be temporarily put aside to access the blue and red blocks.\n   - *Action: (put-down yellow)*\n   - Now, the yellow block is on the table and the hand is empty.\n\n3. **Pick up the red block:**\n   - The red block is clear and on the table, so we can pick it up.\n   - *Action: (pick-up red)*\n   - Now, we are holding the red block.\n\n4. **Stack the red block on the blue block:**\n   - The blue block is clear now (since the yellow block was unstacked from it), so we can stack the red block on it.\n   - *Action: (stack red blue)*\n   - Now, the blue block is no longer clear, and the hand is empty.\n\n5. **Pick up the yellow block:**\n   - The yellow block, which was put down, is clear and on the table, so we can pick it up.\n   - *Action: (pick-up yellow)*\n   - Now, we are holding the yellow block.\n\n6. **Stack the yellow block on the red block:**\n   - The red block is clear, having been just placed on the blue block, so we can stack the yellow block on top of it.\n   - *Action: (stack yellow red)*\n   - Now, the yellow block is on top of the red block, which is on top of the blue block, completing the goal.\n\nBy following these steps, we achieve the desired configuration with minimal time. \n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)",

Pick up the red block (since it is clear and on the table).\n2. Stack the red block on top of the yellow block (since the yellow block is clear).\n\nStep 5: Verify that the plan is optimal.\n- The orange block and blue block configuration already meets the goal.\n- The red and yellow block configuration can be achieved in the minimal steps outlined above.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red yellow)",

The red block is currently on top of the blue block, and the red block is clear. This takes 1 minute.\n     - Performing: `unstack red blue`\n\n   - Put down the red block on the table to make the hand empty again. This takes 1 minute.\n     - Performing: `put-down red`\n\n   - Pick up the yellow block, which is currently clear, so the hand can now hold it. This takes 1 minute.\n     - Performing: `pick-up yellow`\n\n   - Stack the yellow block on top of the red block, making the configuration align partially with the goal state. This takes 1 minute.\n     - Performing: `stack yellow red`\n\n   - Unstack the blue block from the orange block; the blue block is clear at this point. This takes 1 minute.\n     - Performing: `unstack blue orange`\n\n   - Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block now, achieving the final goal structure.

The first step in achieving the goal is to clear the blue block by removing it from the orange block.\n   - Unstack the blue block from the orange block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n2. Now, the blue block is clear and the hand is holding the blue block.\n   - Stack the blue block on top of the red block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n3. Next, you need to clear the orange block so it can be stacked on top of the blue block.\n   - Pick up the orange block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n4. Finally, you stack the orange block on top of the blue block.\n   - Stack the orange block on top of the blue block. This takes 1 minute.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n- Red is on top of yellow (remains unchanged and satisfies part of the goal).\n- Blue is on top of red (achieved).\n- Orange is on top of blue (achieved).\n\nThe plan achieves the goal in a total of 4 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: ((unstack blue orange)  \n(stack blue red)  \n(pick-up orange)  \n(stack orange blue))",

This action takes 1 minute.\n   - **Put Down the Orange Block:** After unstacking, we need to put the orange block on the table to free up the hand. This action takes an additional 1 minute.\n   - **Unstack the Red Block from Yellow Block:** The red block is now clear after the orange block has been removed, so unstacking is possible. This action takes 1 minute.\n   - **Put Down the Red Block:** This action is necessary to clear the hand to pick the next required block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n5. **Achieve the Goal Configuration:**\n   - **Pick Up the Orange Block:** With the hand empty and the orange block clear on the table, pick up the orange block. This takes 1 minute.\n   - **Stack the Orange Block on Yellow Block:** Now with the orange block in hand, stack it on top of the yellow block. This moves us to the final goal configuration. This takes 1 minute.\n\n6. **Time to Achieve Goal:** The total time taken for these actions is 6 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack orange red)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)",

    "answer": "Step by Step INFERENCE HERE:\n\n1. The initial conditions are that the orange block and the yellow block are clear. The hand is empty. The red block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, and both the blue and orange blocks are on the table.\n\n2. The goal is to have the blue block on top of the yellow block, the orange block on top of the blue block, and the yellow block on top of the red block.\n\n3. We begin by recognizing the necessity of placing the yellow block directly on the red block as part of the final arrangement.\n\n4. To achieve this, we first need to ensure that the yellow block is free to be moved later.\n\n5. Currently, the yellow block is on top of the red block. To access the red block, unstack the yellow block from atop the red block.\n\n6. Once the yellow block is unstacked, we maintain its clear status by stacking it on top of the orange block.\n\n7. With the red block now clear, unstack the red block from atop the blue block.\n\n8. Put down the red block, freeing the hand.\n\n9. Unstack the yellow block from the orange block, since we need the yellow block to be above the red block at the end.\n\n10. Stack the yellow block on top of the red block directly.\n\n11. With the red and yellow blocks in the correct order, we can move the blue block to its intended position.\n\n12. Pick up the blue block from the table.\n\n13. Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block.\n\n14. Finally, pick up the orange block.\n\n15. Stack the orange block on top of the blue block.\n\nBy following these steps methodically, we achieve the desired stack order efficiently.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow red) (stack yellow orange) (unstack red blue) (put-down red) (unstack yellow orange) (stack yellow red) (pick-up blue) (stack blue yellow) (pick-up orange) (stack orange blue)",

This takes 1 minute.\n\n2. **Stack Red Block on Blue Block:**\n   - The blue block is clear, so we can stack the red block on top of the blue block. This action makes the blue block not clear anymore. This takes 1 minute.\n\n3. **Pick Up Yellow Block:**\n   - Now, we need to move the yellow block. The yellow block is on the table and is clear, so we can pick it up. This takes 1 minute.\n\n4. **Stack Yellow Block on Red Block:**\n   - The red block is clear since it's on top of the blue block (red was stacked on blue in step 2). We can stack the yellow block on top of the red block.

To proceed, unstack yellow from red, which takes 1 minute. After this step, the yellow block is in hand and red becomes clear.\n\n2. **Put down yellow**: Since the goal involves blue being on top of yellow, and yellow is in hand, place it on the table. Now, yellow is on the table, clear and hand is empty. This action takes 1 minute.\n\n3. **Unstack red from blue**: The red is now clear since yellow has been removed, and it's on top of the blue block. Unstack red from blue. Red is now held, blue becomes clear. This step takes 1 minute.\n\n4. **Put down red**: Since the goal wants orange on top of red, put red on the table to make further progress. Red is now on the table, clear, and the hand is empty. This action takes 1 minute.\n\n5. **Unstack blue from orange**: Now that the red block is handled, the blue block is at the right place to be stacked on yellow. Unstack blue from orange. Blue is now in hand and orange becomes clear. This takes 1 minute.\n\n6. **Stack blue on yellow**: Proceed by stacking blue on yellow since yellow is on the table and previously made clear. This step stacks blue in the desired location on yellow. This takes 1 minute.\n\n7. **Pick up orange**: With clear orange on the table and free hand, pick up orange. Orange is now in hand and no longer on the table (effectively meant for final stacking). This takes 1 minute.\n\n8. **Stack orange on red**: The last goal is to place orange on red. The red block was previously put on the table and remains clear. Stack orange on red, achieving the final desired state.

The goal is to move the blue block to be on top of the yellow block and the orange block to be on top of the red block.\n\n3. To achieve this, first, we must address the positioning of the orange block since it is on top of the blue block, but it needs to end on top of the red block. Therefore, the first action is to unstack the orange block from the blue block.\n\n4. With the orange block now held in hand, the next step is to put the orange block down on the table to free up the blue block, making it clear.\n\n5. Next, we address the position of the blue block. The blue block is currently on top of the red block and needs to be moved to the top of the yellow block. Therefore, we unstack the blue block from the red block.\n\n6. Now holding the blue block, we stack it on top of the yellow block as per the goal requirement.\n\n7.

Action 1: Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block.\n   - This is allowed because the blue block is clear and our hand is empty.\n   - After this action, the blue block is in hand.\n\n5. Action 2: Put down the blue block.\n   - This action clears our hand.\n\n6. Now, the yellow block is clear and the orange block is still clear. The next step is to deal with the orange block.\n\n7.

    "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the orange block and the blue block on top of the red block while minimizing the time taken, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Red block is clear.\n   - Orange block is clear.\n   - Hand is empty.\n   - Red block is on top of the yellow block.\n   - Orange block is on top of the blue block.\n   - Blue block is on the table.\n   - Yellow block is on the table.\n\n2. **Goal State**: \n   - Red block is on top of the orange block.\n   - Blue block is on top of the red block.\n\n**Steps to Achieve the Goal**:\n\n- **Step 1**: Unstack the orange block from the blue block.\n  - This operation clears the orange block. Time taken: 1 minute.\n\n- **Step 2**: Put down the orange block to free up the hand.\n  - The orange block remains clear on the table. Time taken: 1 minute.\n\n- **Step 3**: Unstack the red block from the yellow block.\n  - This operation clears the red block and frees up the hand for the next action. Time taken: 1 minute.\n\n- **Step 4**: Stack the red block on the cleared orange block.\n  - This places the red block on top of the orange block as per the goal. Time taken: 1 minute.\n\n- **Step 5**: Pick up the blue block from the table since it is clear.\n  - The hand holds the blue block ready for the next operation. Time taken: 1 minute.\n\n- **Step 6**: Stack the blue block on the red block.\n  - This completes the goal of having blue on red, and red on orange. Time taken: 1 minute.\n\nEach step described above takes 1 minute, resulting in a total of 6 minutes to meet the requirements of the goal state.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange blue)  \n(put-down orange)  \n(unstack red yellow)  \n(stack red orange)  \n(pick-up blue)  \n(stack blue red)",

    "answer": "1. Given the initial conditions, we see that the blue block is on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is on top of the orange block. The red block is clear and on the table.\n\n2. The first goal is to have the red block on top of the orange block. Since the red block is already clear and on the table, we can pick it up directly. \n\n3. However, the first step should be dealing with the existing stack that involves blue, yellow, and orange blocks. The first action is to unstack the blue block from the yellow block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n4. After unstacking the blue block, we need to put it down on the table. This takes another 1 minute.\n\n5. Next, unstack the yellow block from the top of the orange block. This takes 1 minute. Now, the orange block is clear.\n\n6. We aim to stack the yellow block on the blue block as per final goal requirement that yellow should go on top of red. Since blue is temporarily clear, we stack the yellow block onto the blue block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n7. Pick up the red block, since it is already clear on the table. This takes 1 minute.\n\n8. Stack the red block on top of the orange block. This completes part of the goal condition where the red is on top of the orange. This takes 1 minute.\n\n9. We must now move the yellow block from the blue block to place it on top of the red block. Therefore, unstack the yellow block from the blue block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n10. Stack the unstacked yellow block on top of the red block, aligning with the final state where yellow goes on top of red. This takes 1 minute.\n\n11. Finally, pick up the blue block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n12. Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block, completing the final arrangement. This takes 1 minute.\n\nCalculating the total time from the steps above gives us 9 actions, each taking 1 minute for a total of 12 minutes, considering the given precision.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue yellow)",

To achieve the goal that the red block is on top of the blue block (after some rearrangements), which is ultimately on the orange block, and the yellow block is on top of the red block, we should identify the necessary moves:\n\n3. Unstack the **red block** from on top of the **blue block**. \n   - The red block is currently clear, so this action takes 1 minute.\n\n4. The goal is to have the red on yellow momentarily, which stabilizes the structure temporarily, so:\n   - **Stack the red block** on top of the **yellow block** (because the yellow is also clear and on the table preferable, but considering steps ahead, it's optional).\n\n5. **Pick up the blue block**.\n   - The blue block is already clear on the table, so this takes another 1 minute.\n\n6. **Stack the blue block** on top of the **orange block**.\n   - This follows because the blue is to be placed onto the orange block, according to the requirement.\n\n7. Now, the yellow block is currently under the red. To adhere to final positioning, unstack **red block** from the **yellow block** (if previously stacked).\n\n8. **Stack the red block** back on top of the **blue block**.\n   - This maintains desired goal configuration where red is on blue and blue is on orange.\n\n9. Finally, **pick up the yellow block**.\n\n10. **Stack the yellow block** on top of the **red block**.\n   - Final goal is to have the yellow on top of red, completing the specified arrangement.\n\nFinal Answer: \n```\n(unstack red blue)\n(stack red yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(stack red blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)\n```",

Now, the orange block is clear, and we are holding it.\n\n6. **Put Down the Orange Block**: Since the orange block is now unstacked and in the hand, the next action is to put it down on the table. This clears our hand and takes 1 minute.\n\n7. **Pick Up the Blue Block**: Once the orange block is placed down, the blue block becomes clear.

With the yellow block now clear, stack it on top of the red block (orange block\u2019s top is now red block), which achieves one part of the goal. This action takes 1 minute.\n\n7. Finally, pick up the blue block, which is initially on the table, to stack it on top of the yellow block. Picking up takes 1 minute.\n\n8. Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block, achieving the remaining goal condition. Stacking the blue block takes 1 minute.\n\nThe total time is 8 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange red)\n(put-down orange)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue yellow)",

    "answer": "Step 1: The initial state shows that the blue block is on top of the yellow block. To achieve the goal, blue must eventually be on top of the red block. Therefore, we first need to unstack the blue block from the yellow block. This takes 1 minute.\n\nStep 2: After unstacking, the blue block is held in hand. The next step is to put down the blue block so that we can use the hand for other actions. This also takes 1 minute.\n\nStep 3: Now, we need to move the orange block onto the yellow block to meet one part of our goal conditions. Since the orange block is clear and on the table, we can pick it up. This takes 1 minute.\n\nStep 4: With the orange block in hand, we now stack it on top of the yellow block. This action makes the yellow block no longer clear. This takes 1 minute.\n\nStep 5: The red block is on the table and is clear. To position it correctly, we pick up the red block. This takes 1 minute.\n\nStep 6: We stack the red block on top of the orange block to meet another goal condition. This also takes 1 minute.\n\nStep 7: We now need to pick up the blue block again since it needs to be on top of the red block to achieve the final goal state. Pick up the blue block from the table. This takes 1 minute.\n\nStep 8: Finally, stack the blue block on top of the red block. This last action completes the goal conditions. This takes 1 minute.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue red)",

Next, pick up the yellow block again and stack it onto the orange block, which is clear. This now matches the goal condition for the yellow block.\n\n6. Now the blue block is clear, so I must unstack the blue block from on top of the red block. Thus, the blue block is in hand.\n\n7. The goal specifies that the red block should be on top of the blue block. Therefore, put down the blue block on the table so it is in place to be stacked.\n\n8. Pick up the red block to prepare for stacking it onto the blue block. \n\n9.

After unstacking, the blue block is in hand and needs to be put down to clear the hand for further operations:\n   - Put down the blue block.\n\n5. **Step 2**: To make the orange block accessible for eventual stacking, unstack the orange block, which is currently supported by the yellow block:\n   - Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block.\n\n6. After unstacking the orange block, we again need to put it down:\n   - Put down the orange block.\n\n7. **Step 3**: The next step is to ensure that the blue block can eventually go under the orange block in a desirable position. For that, the yellow block needs to be free, which is currently occupied by the red block:\n   - Unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block.\n\n8. After unstacking the yellow block, we put it down to make further movements easier:\n   - Put down the yellow block.\n\n9. **Step 4**: Now, pick up the blue block to start positioning the blocks as per the goal requirements:\n   - Pick up the blue block.\n\n10. Place the blue block on top of the yellow block to help form the final arrangement:\n    - Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block.\n\n11. **Step 5**: Pick up the orange block to place it in its appropriate position in the goal state:\n    - Pick up the orange block.\n\n12. Now, position the orange block on top of the blue block, aligning with the desired outcome:\n    - Stack the orange block on top of the blue block.\n\n13. **Step 6**: Finally, pick up the red block and place it to complete the target configuration:\n    - Pick up the red block.\n    - Stack the red block on top of the orange block.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack yellow red)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)",

This requires the hand to be empty, and since the red block is clear, it can be unstacked from the blue block. Time: 1 minute. The hand now holds the red block, and the blue block becomes clear.\n\n   - **Action 2:** Place the red block temporarily. I will place it on the orange block to hold it so I can manipulate the blue and yellow blocks. This action puts down the red block. Time: 1 minute. The hand becomes empty.\n\n   - **Action 3:** Unstack the blue block from the yellow block. The blue block is clear, and the hand is empty, making this move feasible. Time: 1 minute. The hand now holds the blue block, and the yellow block becomes clear.\n\n   - **Action 4:** Put down the blue block on the table. Now, the hand is empty again. Time: 1 minute.\n\n   - **Action 5:** Unstack the red block from the orange block. Since the hand is empty and the red block is clear, I can do this. Time: 1 minute. The hand now holds the red block, and the orange block becomes clear.\n\n   - **Action 6:** Stack the red block onto the yellow block. The red block (currently held) can be stacked on the yellow block since it's clear. Time: 1 minute. Now, the yellow block is no longer clear.\n\n   - **Action 7:** Pick up the blue block. Since the blue block is on the table and clear, I can pick it up. Time: 1 minute. The hand now holds the blue block.\n\n   - **Action 8:** Stack the blue block onto the red block. The blue block (currently held) is stacked on top of the red block since the red block is clear now. Time: 1 minute.

    "answer": "To solve this problem, let's consider the initial conditions, the desired goal, and follow the detailed inference approach step-by-step to reach the solution:\n\n**Initial Conditions:**\n- Yellow block is clear.\n- The hand is empty.\n- The red block is on top of the orange block.\n- The orange block is on top of the blue block.\n- The yellow block is on top of the red block.\n- The blue block is on the table.\n\n**Goal Conditions:**\n- Red block on top of the orange block.\n- Blue block on top of the red block.\n- Yellow block on top of the blue block.\n\n**Step-by-Step Inference:**\n\n1. **Unstack Yellow from Red:**  \n   - Since the yellow block is clear, we can unstack it from the red block. The hand becomes occupied with the yellow block.\n   - Time = 1 minute.\n\n2. **Put Down Yellow Block:**  \n   - Put the yellow block on the table; this makes the hand empty again.\n   - Time = 2 minutes total.\n\n3. **Unstack Red from Orange:**\n   - Unstack the red block from the orange block, as the red block is now clear.\n   - Time = 3 minutes total. \n\n4. **Stack Red on Yellow:**\n   - Stack the red block on the currently clear yellow block.\n   - Time = 4 minutes total.\n\n5. **Unstack Orange from Blue:**\n   - Unstack the orange block from the blue block. Now, blue is clear, and the hand is occupied with orange.\n   - Time = 5 minutes total.\n\n6. **Put Down Orange Block:**\n   - Put the orange block on the table, making the hand empty again.\n   - Time = 6 minutes total.\n\n7. **Unstack Red from Yellow:**\n   - Unstack the red block from the yellow block, making yellow clear.\n   - Time = 7 minutes total.\n\n8. **Stack Red on Orange:**\n   - Stack the red block on the clear orange block.\n   - Time = 8 minutes total.\n\n9. **Pick Up Blue Block:**\n   - Pick up the clear blue block from the table.\n   - Time = 9 minutes total. \n\n10. **Stack Blue on Red:**\n    - Stack the blue block on the clear red block.\n    - Time = 10 minutes total.\n\n11. **Pick Up Yellow Block:**\n    - Pick up the clear yellow block from the table. \n    - Time = 11 minutes total.\n\n12. **Stack Yellow on Blue:**\n    - Finally stack the yellow block on top of the clear blue block.\n    - Time = 12 minutes total.\n\nFollowing this sequence achieves the desired goal efficiently.

To achieve this, we need to adjust the current stack configuration.\n\n1. **Unstack the blue block from the red block**: The blue block is currently on top and clear, so we can unstack it. This takes 1 minute.\n\n2. **Put down the blue block**: We need our hand free to manipulate the other blocks. Putting down the blue block takes 1 minute.\n\n3. **Unstack the red block from the yellow block**: With the blue block set aside, and because our hand is empty, the red block (clear on top of the yellow) can be unstacked. This takes 1 minute.\n\n4. **Put down the red block**: We need our hand free again. This takes 1 minute.\n\n5. **Unstack the yellow block from the orange block**: Now, with both hands free and the red block aside, the yellow block can be unstacked since it is clear now (no blocks on top). This takes 1 minute.\n\n6. **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block**: We do this to temporarily store the yellow block out of the way. This takes 1 minute.\n\nAt this point, we want the orange block to be on top of the red block, so we need to move the orange block.\n\n7. **Pick up the orange block**: We have cleared the stack off the table so we can now pick up the orange block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n8. **Stack the orange block on top of the red block**: Moving the orange block to its goal location over the red block. This takes 1 minute.\n\nNext, we need to get the yellow block back on top of the orange block to achieve the final config.\n\n9. **Unstack the yellow block from the blue block**: We separated these blocks earlier, and now our goal is to have the yellow block on top of the orange block, so we must unstack it from where we placed it temporarily. This takes 1 minute.\n\n10. **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block**: Our goal is met by stacking the yellow block on the orange block. This takes 1 minute.\n\nTotal time taken: 10 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack blue red)  \n(put-down blue)  \n(unstack red yellow)  \n(put-down red)  \n(unstack yellow orange)  \n(stack yellow blue)  \n(pick-up orange)  \n(stack orange red)  \n(unstack yellow blue)  \n(stack yellow orange)",

We need to clear the orange block, so we unstack the yellow block from the orange block. This step takes 1 minute.\n\n4. After unstacking, we put down the yellow block on the table. This takes 1 minute and clears the orange block.\n\n5. The blue block is initially on the table and is currently clear, so we pick up the blue block. Picking up the blue block takes 1 minute.\n\n6. Next, we stack the blue block on top of the yellow block, which is on the table and clear. This takes 1 minute.\n\n7. The orange block is now clear and is on the table. We pick up the orange block.

    "answer": "Step-by-step inference:\n\n1. The initial condition has the red block on top of the blue block, the orange block on the yellow block, and the yellow block on the red block. The orange block is clear and the hand is empty. We need to have the final goal of the orange block on top of the yellow block and the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n\n2. Since the orange block is already on top of the yellow block, let\u2019s unstack the orange block; this requires:\n   - Unstack the orange block from the yellow block. [1 minute]\n   - Put down the orange block to a clear spot on the table. [1 minute]\n\n3. Next, unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block:\n   - Unstack the yellow block from the red block. [1 minute]\n   - Stack the yellow block onto the orange block. The objective now is to have the intermediate stack of yellow on orange. [1 minute]\n\n4. Now, unstack the red block from the blue block:\n   - Unstack the red block from on top of the blue block. [1 minute]\n   - Put down the red block. This clears the blue block which is needed as the base of the final configuration of blocks. [1 minute]\n\n5. Unstack the yellow block:\n   - Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block. [1 minute]\n   - Stack the yellow block onto the blue block. This places the yellow block directly on the blue block. [1 minute]\n\n6. Finally, complete the stacking of the orange block on top of the yellow block to reach the goal:\n   - Pick up the orange block. [1 minute]\n   - Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block to complete the configuration as per the goal. [1 minute]\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack yellow red)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)\n```",

Place the yellow block somewhere else.\n   - Action taken: `(unstack yellow orange)`\n\n8. **Put down the yellow block:**\n   - Put the yellow block down to clear the orange block.\n   - Action taken: `(put-down yellow)`\n\n9. **Pick up the orange block:**\n   - With the yellow block down, pick up the orange block.\n   - Action taken: `(pick-up orange)`\n\n10. **Stack the orange block on top of the red block:**\n    - Stack the orange block on top of the red block to complete the goal configuration.\n    - Action taken: `(stack orange red)`\n\nBy following these steps, the goal configuration is achieved in the minimum time, considering each action takes 1 minute.

The blue block is clear and on the table.\n\n2. Begin by addressing the most immediate obstacle to reach the goal state, where the orange block needs to be moved onto the yellow block and the blue block needs to be on top of the orange block.\n\n3. First, unstack the orange block from the red block. This action takes 1 minute and allows the orange block to be handled separately.\n\n4. Now that the orange block is free, temporarily stack the orange block onto the blue block to keep it accessible for later placement onto the yellow block.\n\n5. Next, unstack the red block from the top of the yellow block. This action makes the yellow block clear, which is necessary for stacking.\n\n6. Put down the red block separately on the table so it does not interfere with subsequent actions. This ensures that the necessary blocks remain accessible and manageable.\n\n7. Undo the temporary stack by unstacking the orange block from the blue block to allow the orange block to be stacked onto the yellow block, achieving part of the goal state.\n\n8. Stack the orange block onto the yellow block, completing the requirement for the orange block to be on top of the yellow block.\n\n9. Pick up the blue block, which was initially on the table, as it now needs to be placed on top of the orange block.\n\n10.

    "answer": "Step by Step INFERENCE:\n\n1. The initial condition is that the yellow block is on top of the blue block. To reach the goal state, the yellow block must first be removed from the blue block. Therefore, the first action is to unstack the yellow block from the blue block. This takes 1 minute.\n   \n2. To achieve the goal where the yellow block is on top of the orange block and to maintain the yellow block not blocking any other goals, we can first stack the yellow block on the red block. The red block is clear and on the table. Therefore, the next action is to stack the yellow block on top of the red block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n3. With the table setup allowing sequential actions, we turn to the goal to have the orange block on top of the blue block. Therefore, we next pick up the orange block, as it is already clear and on the table. This takes 1 minute.\n\n4. We can now stack the orange block on top of the blue block to partially achieve the goal. This takes 1 minute.\n\n5. With the blue-orange stack in place, we address the temporary placement of the yellow block. We need it on top of the orange block for the goal to be complete. Therefore, we unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n6. Now, we stack the yellow block on top of the orange block, achieving the condition where the yellow block is on the orange block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n7. Finally, we need the red block, which is currently clear and on the table, on top of the yellow block to achieve the first part of the final goal state. We pick up the red block.

The action takes 1 minute.\n\n2. **Put Down the Orange Block**:\n   - After unstacking Orange, put it down on the table to free up your hand, taking 1 minute.\n\n3. **Pick Up the Blue Block**:\n   - With the hand empty and Blue clear on the table after putting Orange down, pick up Blue. This takes 1 minute.\n\n4. **Stack the Blue Block on Top of the Red Block**:\n   - The goal is to have the Blue block on top of the Red block.

    "answer": "Step 1: The initial conditions state that the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, and the yellow block is on top of the orange block. The red block is on the table.\n\nStep 2: The goal is to have the orange block on top of the yellow block. \n\nStep 3: To achieve this goal, we need to make both the orange and yellow blocks clear. Currently, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, so the first step is to unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block.\n\nStep 4: Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block. This action takes 1 minute. The hand is now holding the yellow block, and the orange block is clear.\n\nStep 5: Next, we put down the yellow block so that the hand is empty and we can interact with the orange block. Put down the yellow block, which takes another 1 minute. The yellow block is now on the table and the hand is empty.\n\nStep 6: Now we need to make the orange block clear. Since the orange block is currently on top of the blue block, our next step is to unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block. Unstack the orange block, which takes another 1 minute. The hand is now holding the orange block, and the blue block is clear.\n\nStep 7: With the orange block held and the yellow block clear (and on the table), we can now stack the orange block on top of the yellow block. Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block, which takes another 1 minute.\n\nStep 8: We have now achieved our goal: the orange block is on top of the yellow block.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(stack orange yellow)",
