Initially, the red block is on top of the yellow block, which is on the blue block. The blue block is on top of the orange block. \n\nSince our hand is empty, we can start moving blocks. The immediate step is to clear the path by which the red block can be placed on the orange block. To do this, we need to move everything on top of the orange block. This sequence involves removing the red block from the yellow and placing it down, followed by moving the yellow from the blue and placing it down, then finally removing the blue from the orange and placing it down. Once the orange block is cleared, we can pick up the red block and place it on top of the orange block.\n\nThe sequence is as follows:\n1. Unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block.\n2.

Our goal is to have the blue block on top of the orange block, the orange block on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block on top of the red block.\n3. To achieve this, we first need to clear the blue block, as it currently has the red block on top of it. We unstack the red block from the blue block, then put down the red block on the table.\n4. Now, the blue block is clear, but it is still on top of the orange block. We unstack the blue block from the orange block and put it down.\n5. The orange block is currently sitting on the yellow block. To move them into the desired positions, we first unstack the orange block from the yellow block.\n6. The orange block should ultimately go back on top of the yellow, but to achieve the intermediate goal configuration, we place the orange block onto the blue block temporarily.\n7.

Additionally, the red block and the orange block are on the table.\n\nWe start the planning by performing the following actions:\n\n1. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block**: Since the yellow block is clear, we can unstack it, making our hand occupied with the yellow block.\n   \n2. **Put down the yellow block on the table:** This action frees our hands and leaves the blue block clear.\n\n3. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the red block:** With the blue block now clear, we can unstack it, holding the blue block in our hands.\n\n4. **Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block:** Finally, we stack the blue block on the yellow block, fulfilling the requirement of the goal where the blue block is on top of the yellow block.\n\nThrough this sequence of actions, we achieve the desired configuration. Each action takes 1 minute, and this plan accomplishes the goal in the shortest possible time.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack blue red)\n(stack blue yellow)",

Currently, the red block is on top of the yellow block, but our goal requires the yellow block to be on top of the blue block. Therefore, we first need to clear the yellow block by unstacking the red block from it.\n\n2. Unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block:\n   - This makes the yellow block clear, and the red block will be removed from the stack. (1 minute)\n\n3. Put down the red block:\n   - Put the red block down so the hand is free to move the yellow block. (1 minute)\n\n4. Pick up the yellow block:\n   - With the hand empty and the yellow block clear, pick up the yellow block. (1 minute)\n\n5. Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block:\n   - Since the blue block is clear, stack the yellow block on top of it.

Since the yellow block is clear and our hand is empty, we can unstack the yellow block from the orange block.\n\n2. Once the yellow block is unstacked, we should put it down on the table as both the red and blue blocks also need to be positioned correctly to fulfill the final stacking conditions.\n\n3.

To minimize the time taken with the actions predefined, here\u2019s how the plan should proceed:\n\n1. **Unstack the Red Block from the Blue Block:** Since the red block is currently on top of the blue block and is clear (no block on top) and the hand is empty, we can unstack it. This action takes 1 minute.\n\n2. **Stack the Red Block on top of the Yellow Block:** With the red block held in our hand after unstacking, and the yellow block being clear, we can stack the red block on top of the yellow block, taking another 1 minute.\n\n3. **Pick up the Orange Block:** Now, with the red block placed correctly, we turn our attention to the orange block, which is clear and on the table. We need to pick it up, taking 1 minute.\n\n4. **Stack the Orange Block on Top of the Blue Block:** Finally, with the orange block in hand and the blue block clear and ready on the table, we stack the orange block on top of the blue block, requiring 1 minute.\n\nThrough this effective sequence of operations, we achieve the goal configuration with a minimum time expenditure of 4 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red blue)  \n(stack red yellow)  \n(pick-up orange)  \n(stack orange blue)  ",

Your final goal is to have the orange block on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block on top of the blue block on the table.\n\nTo do this, start by unstacking the yellow block from the orange block. The red block is on the table and clear, allowing you to use it temporarily to meet intermediate steps. Stack the yellow block on top of the red block temporarily, just to get it off from the orange block, so you can move the orange block. Next, unstack the orange block from the blue block and put it down on the table. Your hand will be empty again, so unstack the yellow block from the red block and stack it onto the blue block, which is on the table and clear. Finally, complete the task by picking up the orange block and stacking it on top of the yellow block.\n\nBy following the above strategy, you'll achieve the desired block configuration in an efficient manner. \n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow red)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack yellow red)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)",

With the goal of getting the orange block back on top of the yellow, we place the orange block directly on the table temporarily, and then stack it back onto the yellow once the yellow is put down on the table.\n\nSimultaneously, we need to free the red block by unstacking it from the blue block so that we can later put the blue block on top of the red.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the yellow block on top of the blue block, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Unstacking Blue from the Orange**: The blue block is currently on top of the orange block, and since the goal involves the yellow block being on top of the blue block, we must first clear the blue block. We start by unstacking the blue block from the orange block. This action will leave the hand holding the blue block.\n\n2. **Putting Down Blue Block**: After unstacking the blue block, we need to free up our hand to manipulate other blocks. We perform the put down action on the blue block, placing it on the table and making it clear.\n\n3. **Unstacking Orange from the Yellow**: Next, we need to clear the orange block, which is currently stacked on the yellow block (since yellow is lower in the stack and we want to move it). We unstack the orange block from the yellow block.\n\n4. **Putting Down Orange Block**: Once we've unstacked the orange block, we proceed to put it down to again free the hand.\n\n5. **Unstacking Yellow from Red**: With the orange block out of the way, we now unstack the yellow block from the red block.\n\n6. **Stacking Yellow on Blue**: Finally, with the yellow block in hand and the blue block clear on the table, we achieve the goal by stacking the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n\nEach of these steps, executed once, takes a total of 6 minutes, one minute per action. Thus, we have moved the blocks minimally to achieve the desired final stack with the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack yellow red)\n(stack yellow blue)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the orange block on top of the blue block and the yellow block on top of the red block, we need to rearrange the initial configuration efficiently.\n\n1. The initial conditions specify that the orange block is on top of the blue block, and we already want the orange block on top of the blue block. Thus, we do not need to move the orange and blue blocks\u2014they already satisfy the condition for one part of the goal.\n\n2. The yellow block is currently on top of the orange block. To make the red block clear for the yellow block, we must move the yellow block. Moreover, since the red block is on the table and clear initially, we can directly place the yellow block on top of the red block once it is unstacked.\n\n3. Therefore, the most efficient sequence of actions is to first unstack the yellow block from the orange block. Then, since our hand is empty, we can directly stack the yellow block on top of the clear red block.\n\nThese steps ensure that the goal configuration is achieved in the minimal number of steps, specifically focusing on the goal arrangement.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow red)",

This action converts the orange block to non-clear and arranges part of our final goal configuration with yellow on top of orange.\n\n4. Moving on, the blue block is currently on top of the red block. For our goal, we need to rearrange these blocks. Start by unstacking the blue block from the red block.\n\n5. Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block. This step makes yellow non-clear but progresses us closer to the goal configuration by having blue on top of yellow.\n\n6.

This completes our goal configuration as it results in red on top of blue, blue on top of yellow, and yellow on top of orange.\n\nFollowing these steps efficiently, respecting the one-block-at-a-time limitation and ensuring the hand is empty where necessary, achieves our desired final setup with minimal actions.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(unstack blue red)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)",

The yellow block is on top of the red block, which means we need to move it to make the red block clear and use it as a base.\n\nSince the yellow block is on top of the red block and it is clear, we can start by unstacking the yellow block from on top of the red block, then put it down on the table.

Here's how the plan unfolds:\n\n1. Start with the configuration where the yellow block is on top of the red block and all blocks, including the blue and orange, are on the table and clear.\n\n2. We first need to create the base with the yellow and orange blocks. Since the yellow block is currently on top of the red block and is clear, we can unstack the yellow block from the red block first:\n\n   - Unstack the yellow block from the red block (unstack yellow red).\n   - Put down the yellow block next to the other clear blocks (put-down yellow).\n\n3. Now, with the orange block being clear on the table, we can pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the yellow block to fulfill part of the final arrangement:\n\n   - Pick up the orange block (pick-up orange).\n   - Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block (stack orange yellow).\n\n4. With the orange block stacked and the yellow block no longer being clear, our hand is empty again. The red block must now be placed on top of the orange block:\n\n   - Pick up the red block (pick-up red).\n   - Stack the red block on top of the orange block (stack red orange).\n\n5.

First, we need to unstack the red block from the orange block because our final configuration requires the orange block to be positioned differently.\n2. Once the red block is unstacked, it needs to be put down on the table to free up the space above the orange block.\n3. Now, unstack the orange block from the yellow block. This makes the orange block separate and able to reposition.\n4. Temporarily stack the orange block on top of the red block to keep it clear for further unstacking.\n5. Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block.\n6. Put down the yellow block, so it can be picked up and placed again later.\n7. Unstack the orange block from the red block, as we no longer need it there.\n8. Stack the orange block on top of the blue block, satisfying part of our final goal.\n9. Pick up the yellow block from where it was put down.\n10.

        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE\n\nTo achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the blue block and the orange block on top of the red block, we'll need to carefully consider the initial conditions and necessary steps. Initially, the red block is clear, and it's on the table, which allows us to move it directly. The blue block is also clear and on the table, making it available for stacking. The yellow block is clear, but it's on top of the orange block, which means the orange block is not clear.\n\nHere's how we can efficiently achieve the goal:\n\n1. Pick up the red block, which is clear and on the table, and stack it on top of the blue block. This takes 2 minutes (1 minute to pick up and 1 minute to stack).\n\n2. Next, we need to ensure the orange block can be stacked on top of the red block. The orange block is currently not clear because the yellow block is on top of it. Therefore, we need to unstack the yellow block from the orange block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n3. Once the yellow block is unstacked, we put it down on the table to clear our hand. This takes another minute.\n\n4. After our hand is empty, we can pick up the orange block, which is now clear, and stack it on top of the red block that is already on the blue block. This takes another 2 minutes (1 minute to pick up and 1 minute to stack).\n\nThese steps effectively achieve the final stacking configuration with minimal time spent.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)",

        "answer": "**Inference:**\n\nTo achieve the goal of placing the blocks in the desired configuration, we need to follow a series of logical steps, considering both the initial conditions and the final required configuration.\n\n- The initial condition shows that we have the red block on top of the yellow block, the blue block on top of the orange block, and the yellow block on top of the blue block. Knowing that each action takes 1 minute, we want to break down the minimal steps required to achieve the final configuration where the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the red block, and the yellow block is on top of the orange block.\n\n- Firstly, since the red block is clear and the goal requires the orange block to be on top of the red block, we can start by dealing with the obstructing configurations.\n\n1. **Unstack the red block from the yellow block:** We start by unstacking the red block from the yellow block to clear space for the orange block. (1 min)\n2. **Put down the red block:** We'll need to put down the red block temporarily. (1 min)\n\n3. **Unstack the yellow block from the blue block:** This action clears the path for rearranging them. (1 min)\n4. **Put down the yellow block:** We store the yellow block temporarily. (1 min)\n\n5. **Unstack the blue block from the orange block:** It's necessary to rearrange the blue block. (1 min)\n6. **Put down the blue block:** The blue block is temporarily placed down. (1 min)\n\n7. **Pick up the orange block:** Now we can work on placing the orange block. (1 min)\n8. **Stack the orange block on top of the red block:** This achieves one part of the final goal where the orange block is on the red block. (1 min)\n\n9. **Pick up the yellow block:** With the yellow block available, we prepare it for the next placement. (1 min)\n10. **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block:** Now our second part of the goal is complete, with yellow on orange. (1 min)\n\n11. **Pick up the blue block:** Preparing the blue block for its final position. (1 min)\n12. **Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block:** Finally, this achieves the last part of the goal.

The red block is clear, as per the initial conditions. The objective is to have the red block on top of the yellow block and then place the blue block on top of the red block.\n\n1. We start by unstacking the red block from the blue block. This action clears the blue block and places the red block in our hand.\n2. Next, we stack the red block on top of the clear orange block. This operation frees up our hand while placing the red block elsewhere, preparing us for the next moves.\n3. Now, we unstack the blue block from the yellow block to free up the yellow block's top. We proceed to put down the blue block on the table, which clears our hand.\n4. Then, we unstack the red block from the orange block. With this operation, we hold the red block, preparing it to be placed on the yellow block.\n5. Now, we stack the red block on top of the clear yellow block, satisfying part of our goal. The red block being on top of the yellow block meets our condition.\n6. We then pick up the blue block, which was previously put down.\n7. Finally, we stack the blue block on top of the red block, completing our goal state where the red block is on top of the yellow block, and the blue block is on top of the red block.\n\nThis sequence of operations is efficient and minimizes the actions needed to reach the desired configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red blue)\n(stack red orange)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack red orange)\n(stack red yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue red)",

        "answer": "Inference: To achieve the goal configuration of blocks, we must rearrange the blocks according to the initial conditions and constraints. \n\n1. Starting with the condition where the blue block is clear and the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the yellow block. We need to make the blue block available, so unstack the blue block from the yellow block and put down the blue block. The time taken so far is 2 minutes.\n\n2. Now, since the yellow block is clear, unstack it from the red block and stack it on top of the blue block so that the blue block can later be in its correct position in the goal configuration. The time taken is now 4 minutes.\n\n3. Since our goal involves the orange block being on top of the blue block, and the red block is currently on top of orange and we must clear orange, unstack the red block from orange and put it down. The time taken is now 6 minutes.\n\n4. Now, unstack the yellow block from the blue block so that we can proceed to stack the yellow block onto the red block as per our final goal configuration. This operation takes the time to 8 minutes.\n\n5. Pick up the yellow block and stack it onto the red block. This places yellow correctly onto red as per the final goal. The time taken is now 10 minutes.\n\n6. Finally, pick up the blue block and stack it onto yellow. Pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the blue block.

The red block and the orange block are located on the table, with the yellow block also on the table. The hand is empty. Our objective is to have the yellow block on top of the orange block. \n\nAnalyzing the initial conditions, since the yellow block is currently beneath the blue block, to achieve the desired configuration of the yellow block on the orange block, the blue block first needs to be moved. Because the blue block is currently on the yellow block and is clear, it can be unstacked. Once unstacked, it should be placed down, freeing the yellow block for further manipulation. After that, we can pick up the yellow block and stack it on top of the orange block, as required.

However, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is on top of the orange block. The orange block is on the table. We need to free the red block so we can later stack the orange block on top of it.\n\nHere's the step-by-step inference for the solution:\n\n1. **Unstack the red block from the blue block** - The red block is clear and it is the top block in its stack, so we can unstack it.\n2. **Put down the red block** - After unstacking, we need to put it down to free our hands.\n3. **Unstack the blue block from the yellow block** - The blue block is now clear, so we unstack it.\n4. **Put down the blue block** - Similar to before, we need our hands free.\n5. **Pick up the red block** - The red block is now on the table and clear, so we pick it up.\n6. **Stack the red block on the blue block** - We place the red block on top of the blue block, achieving the first part of the goal state.\n7. **Unstack the yellow block from the orange block** - The yellow block is clear on top of the orange block, so we unstack it.\n8. **Put down the yellow block** - Again, we need to clear our hands.\n9. **Pick up the orange block** - The orange block is now clear, so we can pick it up.\n10. **Stack the orange block on the red block** - Finally, we place the orange block on top of the red block to achieve the complete goal state.\n\nThis plan allows us to rearrange the blocks while satisfying all constraints and achieving the goal configuration with the minimum necessary steps.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)",

After unstacking, we need to clear the blue block from the orange block, allowing us to later stack it back on top of the red block. To do this, unstack the blue block from the orange block and then stack it on top of the red block.\n\n3. The next step is to arrange the orange block on top of the blue block. To achieve this, pick up the orange block, which is already clear since it's on the table, and stack it on top of the blue block.\n\n4. Finally, pick up the yellow block from the table (it is clear) and stack it on top of the orange block.\n\nThis series of actions will fulfill the goal with minimal moves.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)",

It takes 1 minute to pick up a block.\nUnstack a block from on top of another block. It takes 1 minute to unstack a block from on top of another block.\nPut down a block. It takes 1 minute to put down a block.\nStack a block on top of another block. It takes 1 minute to stack a block on top of another block.\n\nI have the following restrictions on my actions:\nI can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.\nI can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.\nI can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block, the red block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the red block and the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

I want to minimize the time taken to achieve my goal.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN] \n\n\nPlease infer first, then place the plan at the end, after 'Final Answer:'. The plan you place after 'Final Answer:' should be written in triplet format, which contains (action, object_1, object_2). For example, (unstack red blue) means that you unstack the red object from the blue object.",

        "answer": "The initial conditions are that the yellow block is on top of the orange block, which is on top of the blue block, which is on top of the red block. The red block is on the table. Our goal is to have the orange block on top of the yellow block. \n\nTo achieve this, we need to clear the path for the orange block to be placed on top of the yellow block:\n\n1. The yellow block is currently on top of the orange and is clear, which means we can unstack the yellow block from the orange block first.\n2. After unstacking, we put down the yellow block to free our hands.\n3. Next, unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block \u2013 the orange block is currently on top of the blue block, so this step is valid.\n4. Finally, stack the orange block on top of the now clear yellow block to achieve the goal.\n\nEach step takes 1 minute, so the total time taken to execute this plan is 4 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(stack orange yellow)",
