The red block is currently on top of the yellow block, and the goal is to have the yellow block on top of the red block. The blue block is on top of the orange block and needs to be moved on top of the yellow block. Let's work through the process:\n\n1. **Unstack the red block from the yellow block**: Currently, the red block is on top of the yellow block. We unstack the red block since it will not be part of the final configuration where the yellow block is on top of the red block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n2. **Put down the red block**: We need the yellow block to be directly on top of the red block in the final configuration. For now, we put down the red block onto the table. This takes 1 minute.\n\n3. **Pick up the yellow block**: With the red block down and out of the way, we pick up the yellow block in preparation to stack it on the red block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n4. **Stack the yellow block on top of the red block**: We now stack the yellow block on the red block, meeting one condition of the final goal. This takes 1 minute.\n\n5. **Unstack the blue block from the orange block**: With our hand empty again, we can now proceed to unstack the blue block from the orange block. This will prepare the blue block for placement on the yellow block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n6. **Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block**: Finally, we stack the blue block onto the now-cleared yellow block, achieving the final configuration specified in the goal. This takes 1 minute.\n\nEach of these actions follows the restrictions provided and utilizes the minimal number of required steps to achieve the objective.

With the red block now clear and my hand empty, I can pick it up. To accomplish this, I will:\n   - Pick up the red block. (1 additional minute)\n\n6. Finally, to achieve the goal, I'll stack the red block on top of the blue block. This results in:\n   - Stack the red block on top of the blue block. (1 final minute)\n\nThe entire plan takes a total of 6 minutes to execute.\n\n[PLAN END]\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack yellow red)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of stacking the red block on top of the blue block, which is on the yellow block and the yellow block on the orange block, we begin by addressing the current configuration and constraints:\n\n1. The initial condition states that the blue block is on top of the red block, the red block is on top of the orange block, and the orange block is on the table. The yellow block is clear and on the table.\n\n2. First, we need to ensure that the red block is accessible and clear to stack later on, which requires the removal of the blue block.\n\n3. Begin by unstacking the blue block from the red block. The blue block is clear, allowing us to perform this action. Once unstacked, put down the blue block, making the red block clear.\n\n4. Next, we unstack the red block from the orange block and put it down, leaving the orange block clear for further actions.\n\n5. With the orange block clear and on the table, we can start our goal formation. Pick up the yellow block and stack it on top of the orange block. By doing this, we satisfy part of the goal of having the yellow block on top of the orange block.\n\n6. Following this, pick up the blue block, which is now on the table and clear, and stack it on top of the yellow block to build the structure needed.\n\n7. Lastly, pick up the red block from the table and stack it on top of the blue block, completing the desired stack structure.\n\nThrough this series of steps, the goal is achieved efficiently following all the restrictions.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the red block is on top of the yellow block and the blue block is on top of the red block, we start with the following initial conditions (red on orange, blue on yellow, orange on blue, and yellow on table). Here's the step-by-step inference:\n\n1. **Unstack the red block from on top of the orange block:**\n   - Since the red block is initially clear and on top of the orange block, I will unstack it as the first action (1 minute).\n\n2. **Put down the red block:**\n   - Now that I'm holding the red block after unstacking, I will put it down (1 more minute, totaling 2 minutes).\n\n3. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block:**\n   - With the red block put down, unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block, as orange is clear now (1 more minute, totaling 3 minutes).\n\n4. **Put down the orange block:**\n   - After unstacking the orange block, I will put it down (1 more minute, totaling 4 minutes).\n\n5. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block:**\n   - Now, blue is the next block to be moved for the goal, so unstack it from the yellow block (1 more minute, totaling 5 minutes).\n\n6. **Stack the blue block on top of the orange block:**\n   - With blue unstacked, I will stack it on top of the orange block, clearing up the position of blue (1 more minute, totaling 6 minutes).\n\n7. **Pick up the red block:**\n   - Time to use the earlier-put-down red block, so I pick up the clear red block (1 more minute, totaling 7 minutes).\n\n8. **Stack the red block on top of the yellow block:**\n   - Finally, stack the red block on top of the yellow block, meeting half the goals (1 more minute, totaling 8 minutes).\n\n9. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block:**\n   - With the initial stack on orange, blue can now be unstacked (1 more minute, totaling 9 minutes).\n\n10. **Stack the blue block on top of the red block:**\n    - Complete the goal by stacking blue on top of red (1 more minute, resulting in a total of 10 minutes). \n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(stack blue orange)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red yellow)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue red)",

        "answer": "INFERENCE_HERE\n\n1. **Unstack the Red block from Yellow block**: Since the goal is to place the Red block on top of the Blue block, and currently the Red block is on top of the Yellow block, we need to unstack the Red block from the Yellow block first.\n\n2. **Put down the Red block**: Since we need our hand to be free to pick up other blocks, we must temporarily put down the Red block.\n\n3. **Unstack the Yellow block from the table**: Clear the space by moving the Yellow block from the table, since it would block our next step.\n\n4. **Stack the Yellow block back on the Blue block**: To create a stable base for our goal state, we want the Yellow block directly beneath the Blue block.\n\n5. **Pick up the Blue block**: As the next step is to stack the Blue block into the desired position.\n\n6. **Stack the Blue block on top of the Yellow block**: This puts the Blue block in the necessary position in the goal state.\n\n7. **Pick up the Orange block to create the temporary support stack**: This will allow us to stack the Red block last without interference.\n\n8. **Stack the Orange block with the Red block still aside**: Since we ultimately need the Orange block out of the way, we need a temporary stack.\n\n9. **Unstack the Blue block from the Yellow block**: Make space to place the Red block.\n\n10. **Stack the Red block on the Blue block**: This satisfies the goal state of having the Red block on top of the Blue block.\n\n11. **Pick the Yellow block again and put it aside for space**: We must clear all unnecessary stacks.\n\n12. **Stack the Orange block on top of the Blue to complete the goal**: Now the previous steps are reversed to achieve the correct stack order.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red yellow)\n(stack red orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(unstack red orange)\n(stack red blue)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the orange block and the blue block on top of the red block, while minimizing the time, we need to rearrange the blocks based on the initial conditions described. Given that the yellow block is clear and on top of the orange block, we must first unstack the yellow block to gain access to the orange block.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the blue block on top of the red block and the yellow block on top of the orange block, we should follow a series of actions based on the initial conditions. \n\nInitial Conditions:  \n- The hand is empty.  \n- The blue block is on top of the red block and is clear.  \n- The orange block is on top of the yellow block and is clear.  \n- The red block is on the table.  \n- The yellow block is on the table.  \n\nGoal:  \n- The blue block is on top of the red block.  \n- The yellow block is on top of the orange block.  \n\nBased on this, we can determine the plan:  \n\n1.

The initial configuration is that the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is on top of the orange block. The orange block is on the table.\n\n2. The goal is to have the blue block on top of the red block.\n\n3. To free the blue block from beneath the red block, we first need to unstack the red block from on top of the blue block, as it is preventing the reconfiguration.\n\n4. Once the red block is unstacked from the blue block, put down the red block onto the table.\n\n5. Now, with the red block out of the way, the next step is to unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block.\n\n6. Finally, stack the blue block on top of the red block. This completes the transition to the desired goal state.\n\nFollowing these steps gives us an efficient plan that should achieve the goal in minimal time.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(stack blue red)",

Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. The orange block is currently on the table, and the blue block is on top of the red block, which is on top of the orange block.\n2. First, unstack the blue block from on top of the red block. The blue block being clear allows us to perform this action. This takes 1 minute.\n3. Next, put down the blue block, freeing up the hand for the next action. This takes another minute.\n4. Unstack the red block from on top of the orange block, as the red block is now clear after the blue block was unstacked. This action also takes 1 minute.\n5. Put down the red block on the table to clear the hand for the next pickup. Again, this takes 1 minute.\n6. Pick up the orange block from the table where it is clear, taking 1 minute.\n7. Finally, stack the orange block on top of the red block, achieving the desired configuration. This last action takes 1 minute.\n\nThe sequence of actions is methodical and ensures that at each step, the block being moved is clear and the hand is appropriately used.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)",

This action takes 1 minute. The red block is now being held.\n\n2. **Stack the red block on top of the orange block**: The orange block is clear and on the table. We stack the red block on top of it, which takes another 1 minute.

We unstack it from the blue block, which takes 1 minute.

Next, make the red block clear of the yellow block by unstacking it:\n   - Unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block.\n   - Put down the red block.\n\n4. Pick up the blue block from the table (since it is clear) and stack it on the red block (which is now clear):\n   - Pick up the blue block.\n   - Stack the blue block on top of the red block.\n\n5. Finally, stack the yellow block on top of the blue block:\n   - Pick up the yellow block.\n   - Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n\nNow the blocks are arranged in the required order.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange red)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)",

        "answer": "INFERENCE_HERE\n\nTo achieve the goal of having the blue block on top of the yellow block and the orange block on top of the blue block, we start by identifying the current stack structure and the necessary moves.\n\n1. The yellow block is clear and placed on top of the blue block. To rearrange, we need to unstack the yellow block from the blue block.\n2. Once the yellow block is unstacked, we put it down, ensuring the hand is empty for the next action.\n3. The blue block is now clear, but it needs to be moved from its current position on top of the orange block. So, unstack the blue block from the orange block.\n4. The blue block, once unstacked, is stacked on top of the yellow block to meet part of the goal configuration.\n5. The orange block remains on top of the red block initially, and since it needs to be moved on top of the blue block eventually, we unstack the orange block from the red block.\n6. Finally, stack the orange block on top of the blue block, thus achieving the final desired arrangement.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow blue)  \n(put-down yellow)  \n(unstack blue orange)  \n(stack blue yellow)  \n(unstack orange red)  \n(stack orange blue)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, and the orange block is on top of the red block, we begin by addressing the obstructions in the current initial conditions. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Unstack the Yellow Block from the Orange Block**: Since the orange block needs to be beneath the blue block and the yellow block is currently on top of the orange block, we need to unstack the yellow to free the orange block.\n\n2. **Put Down the Yellow Block**: This step places the yellow block aside, keeping it clear and out of the way.\n\n3. **Unstack the Red Block from the Blue Block**: To set the blue block onto the orange as desired, we must unstack the red block from atop the blue.\n\n4. **Stack the Red Block on Top of the Yellow Block**: Since our goal includes having the red block atop the yellow, we stack them once the yellow block is placed aside.\n\n5. **Pick Up the Orange Block**: With the orange block clear, we prepare to move it next.\n\n6. **Stack the Orange Block on Top of the Red Block**: This step places the orange block onto the red block, progressing toward our final configuration.\n\n7. **Pick Up the Blue Block**: Finally, we pick up the blue block, which should now be the final block to position.\n\n8. **Stack the Blue Block on Top of the Orange Block**: The last move completes the stack in the desired goal configuration, with the blue block atop the orange block.\n\nGiven these steps, the plan effectively reconfigures the blocks as desired, minimizing the actions to the essential moves outlined.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow orange) (put-down yellow) (unstack red blue) (stack red yellow) (pick-up orange) (stack orange red) (pick-up blue) (stack blue orange)",

Our goal requires that the red block be on top of the yellow block and the orange block be on top of the blue block.\n\nTo start the plan:\n\n1. **Unstack the red block from on top of the blue block:** The red block is currently clear and on the blue block. We can unstack it to free the blue block and allow us to stack the red block later as needed.\n   \n2. **Stack the red block on top of the yellow block:** With the red block currently being held and the yellow block clear on the table, stack the red block on the yellow block to meet part of our goal conditions.\n\n3. **Pick up the orange block:** Since the orange block is clear and on the table, we pick it up to prepare for stacking it onto the blue block.\n\n4. **Stack the orange block on the blue block:** With the blue block on the table and clear after red has been moved, we stack the orange block onto the blue block to satisfy the remaining goal condition.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red blue)\n(stack red yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the red block is on top of the orange block and the orange block is on top of the blue block, we need to perform a series of valid block operations. Let\u2019s break it down:\n\n1. We begin with the red block on top of the blue block and the yellow block on top of the orange block. The blue and orange blocks are initially on the table.\n\n2. First, the yellow block (which is on top of the orange block) needs to be cleared away since the orange block needs to eventually be under the red block. We start by unstacking the yellow block from the orange block.\n\n3. Next, we put down the yellow block somewhere on the table to free up our hand.\n\n4. Now we can focus on the red block, which is on top of the blue block. The goal is to get the red block on top of the orange block. We start by unstacking the red block from the blue block.\n\n5. Place the red block on top of the yellow block temporarily to keep the sequence feasible.\n\n6. Pick up the orange block from the table since we need to place it under the red block.\n\n7. Stack the orange block on top of the blue block as per the goal criteria.\n\n8. Now, unstack the red block from the yellow block.\n\n9. Finally, stack the red block on top of the orange block to meet the goal conditions.\n\nPerforming these steps this way ensures the blocks are in the desired final positions. Maintaining compliance with the rules means that each operation may take some time, with a process that efficiently manipulates the blocks as necessary.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow orange)  \n(put-down yellow)  \n(unstack red blue)  \n(stack red yellow)  \n(pick-up orange)  \n(stack orange blue)  \n(unstack red yellow)  \n(stack red orange)  ",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the orange block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the blue block, we need to rearrange the blocks according to the initial conditions and desired final setup.\n\nInitially, the orange block is clear and on top of the red block, which is on top of the yellow block. Our goal arrangement requires moving the orange block so that it sits on top of the yellow block (which should be on top of the blue block directly on the table).\n\n1. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the red block**\n   - The orange block is currently on top of the red block and is clear, so we can unstack it. This action takes 1 minute.\n\n2. **Put down the orange block**\n   - We have just unstacked the orange block, so it is in our hand. We put it down on the table. This action takes 1 minute.\n\n3. **Unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block**\n   - Now, the red block is clear since the orange block has been unstacked and put down. We can unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block. This action takes 1 minute.\n\n4. **Put down the red block**\n   - After unstacking the red block, we have it in our hand. We put it down separately. This action takes 1 minute.\n\n5. **Pick up the orange block**\n   - The orange block is currently on the table and clear, so we can pick it up. This action takes 1 minute.\n\n6. **Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block**\n   - Finally, the yellow block is exposed and clear since the red block was unstacked. We can now stack the orange block on top of the yellow block to complete the target arrangement. This action takes 1 minute.\n\nHence, the steps are logically derived to shift blocks into the desired final configuration with minimal time:\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack orange red)  \n(put-down orange)  \n(unstack red yellow)  \n(put-down red)  \n(pick-up orange)  \n(stack orange yellow)  ",

Here's a step-by-step solution that accomplishes this in minimal time:\n\n1. **Unstack orange from yellow**: Since orange is clear and on top of yellow, unstack orange from yellow. This takes 1 minute.\n   \n2. **Put down orange**: With orange in hand, put it down on the table since it needs to be below red. This takes 1 minute.\n\n3. **Unstack red from blue**: Red is clear and is on top of blue. Unstack red from blue. This takes 1 minute.\n\n4. **Stack red on top of orange**: Now that red is in hand and orange is clear, stack red on top of orange. This action takes 1 minute.\n\n5. **Pick up yellow**: Since yellow is clear and on the table, pick up yellow. This takes 1 minute.\n\n6. **Stack yellow on top of red**: Now yellow is in hand, and red is clear. Stack yellow on top of red, which takes 1 minute.\n\n7. **Pick up blue**: Pick up blue since it is on the table and clear. This takes 1 minute.\n\n8. **Stack blue on top of yellow**: Now blue is in hand, and yellow is clear. Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the blue block, the orange block on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block on top of the red block, we need to follow a series of steps carefully by considering the initial conditions and constraints. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**: The blue block is clear and on top of the red block. The yellow block is clear and on top of the orange block. Both the red block and the orange block are on the table, and the hand is empty.\n\n2. **Step 1**: Since the blue block is clear, we can unstack it from the red block.\n   - Action: Unstack the blue block from on top of the red block. \n\n3. **Step 2**: Place the blue block back on the table to clear the hand for further actions.\n   - Action: Put down the blue block.\n\n4. **Step 3**: Pick up the red block, which is now exposed and on the table.\n   - Action: Pick up the red block.\n\n5. **Step 4**: Stack the red block on top of the blue block since the blue block is clear and on the table.\n   - Action: Stack the red block on top of the blue block.\n\n6. **Step 5**: Unstack the yellow block from the orange block because it's clear and on top of the orange block, and the orange block needs to be at the bottom eventually.\n   - Action: Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block.\n\n7. **Step 6**: Stack the yellow block on top of the red block of the new stack (blue-red stack) to move closer to the desired final position.\n   - Action: Stack the yellow block on top of the red block.\n\n8. **Step 7**: Pick up the orange block since it's clear and needs to be placed on top of the yellow block eventually.\n   - Action: Pick up the orange block.\n\n9. **Step 8**: Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block to achieve the final configuration where the orange is on top of yellow, which is on top of the red, which is on top of the blue.\n   - Action: Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block.\n\nFollowing these meticulously planned steps allows achieving the desired arrangement efficiently and directly. Each step takes 1 minute, conforming to the stated duration for actions.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the yellow block, the blue block on top of the red block, and the orange block on top of the blue block, we need to follow these steps. The initial conditions specify that the red, blue, and yellow blocks are all clear, and our hand is empty. Given that the red, orange, and yellow blocks are on the table, and the blue block is on top of the orange block, we need to rearrange these blocks efficiently.\n\n1. Pick up the red block since it is clear.\n2. Stack the red block on top of the yellow block because the yellow block is clear.\n3. Unstack the blue block from the orange block as the blue block is clear and it is on top of the orange block.\n4. Stack the blue block on top of the red block since the red block is now at the top of the stack with the yellow block and is clear.\n5. Pick up the orange block because it is clear after unstacking the blue block.\n6.

Since the orange block is clear, we can unstack it. \n\n2. **Put down the orange block** - After unstacking the orange block, we put it down so that we can free our hand for further actions.\n\n3. **Unstack the yellow block from the blue block** - The yellow block is on top of the blue block but needs to be placed on top of the red block instead. We unstack the yellow block next.\n\n4. **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block** - Since the orange block is now clear on the table, we stack the yellow block onto it. This completes the requirement of having the orange block on top of the yellow block.\n\n5. **Unstack the blue block from the red block** - The blue block needs to be cleared to allow the red block to be moved on top of it later. So, we unstack the blue block.\n\n6. **Put down the blue block** - We temporarily put the blue block down to free up our hand for the next actions.\n\n7. **Pick up the red block** - Next, we pick up the red block, which is currently at the bottom of the blue block.\n\n8. **Stack the red block on top of the blue block** - We place the red block on top of the blue block as part of the goal state.\n\n9. **Unstack the yellow block from the orange block** - We next unstack the yellow block from the orange block, as it must be placed on top of the red block.\n\n10. **Stack the yellow block on top of the red block** - Now, we can stack the yellow block onto the red block to achieve that part of the goal state.\n\n11. **Pick up the orange block** - With the yellow block no longer on top, we can now pick up the clear orange block.\n\n12. **Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block** - Finally, we place the orange block back onto the yellow block to complete the final goal state configuration.\n\nBy following these steps, each block is placed according to the stated goal.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange yellow)  \n(put-down orange)  \n(unstack yellow blue)  \n(stack yellow orange)  \n(unstack blue red)  \n(put-down blue)  \n(pick-up red)  \n(stack red blue)  \n(unstack yellow orange)  \n(stack yellow red)  \n(pick-up orange)  \n(stack orange yellow)",

Since the blue block is clear, we can unstack it from the orange block.

Currently, the yellow block is clear and can be unstacked from the red block.\n\n4. **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block**: Now the orange block is clear, and we want the yellow block eventually on top of the orange block according to our final goal. Therefore, we stack the yellow block on top of the orange block.\n\n5. **Pick up the blue block**: With the yellow block settled, we now can pick up the blue block, which is sitting on the table, and prepare to place it according to the goal.\n\n6. **Stack the blue block on top of the red block**: Finally, with the blue block in hand, we move to stack it on top of the clear red block, which is on the table.

We need to relocate the red block to make room for stacking the blue block onto the yellow block.\n- Unstack the red block from the blue block. (This is possible since the red block is clear.)\n- Put down the red block on the table.\n- Pick up the orange block from the table.\n- Stack the orange block on top of the red block.

The time taken: 1 minute.\n\nStep 3: Pick up the orange block.  \n- Since the orange block is clear, I can pick it up for stacking. The time taken: 1 minute.\n\nStep 4: Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block.  \n- Since both blocks are clear and on the table, I can stack them as needed. The time taken: 1 minute.\n\nStep 5: Unstack the blue block from on top of the red block.  \n- The blue block is still needed for further manipulation, so I unstack it.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is on top of the blue block, we need to plan the actions carefully to minimize the time. Here is a step-by-step inference:\n\n1. **Unstack orange from blue**: The initial condition has the orange block on top of the blue block, which we need to change. The orange block is clear, so it can be unstacked.\n\n2. **Put down orange block**: After unstacking orange, we can put it down as the hand should be empty for the next operation.\n\n3. **Pick up the blue block**: The blue block is now clear after removing the orange block and can be picked up.\n\n4. **Stack blue block on red block**: The red block is clear, allowing us to stack the blue block on top of it.\n\n5. **Pick up the yellow block**: The yellow block is initially clear and can be picked up to achieve the desired structure.\n\n6. **Stack the yellow block on the blue block**: Since the blue block is already stacked on the red block and doesn't have any block on it, it's clear, and we can stack the yellow block on top of it.\n\n7. **Pick up the orange block**: Since the orange block is on the table and clear, it can be picked up to achieve the desired structure.\n\n8. **Stack the orange block on yellow block**: The yellow block is now clear, and the orange block can be stacked on top of it.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that we meet the goal state conditions efficiently.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack orange blue)  \n(put-down orange)  \n(pick-up blue)  \n(stack blue red)  \n(pick-up yellow)  \n(stack yellow blue)  \n(pick-up orange)  \n(stack orange yellow)  ",

        "answer": "[PLAN]\nFirst, I need to make the orange block clear, as it is currently underneath the red block, to use it to construct the final desired stacking order.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the blue block is on top of the orange block, and the orange block is on top of the yellow block, we need to consider the initial condition where the orange block is on top of the red block, and the blue, yellow, red blocks are on the table. \n\nHere is the detailed inference process:\n\n1. Unstack the orange block from on top of the red block. The orange block is on top of the red block, and since the initial condition states the orange block is clear, we can unstack it.\n2. Place the orange block on top of the yellow block. Since the yellow block is clear and on the table, the orange block can be stacked on top of it.\n3. Pick up the blue block. The blue block is clear and on the table, allowing us to pick it up.\n4. Stack the blue block on top of the orange block. After steps 1-3, the orange block is clear because it is now on top of the yellow block, thereby allowing the blue block to be stacked on top.\n\nThis sequence of actions is efficient in minimizing the time taken.

        "answer": "To achieve the target configuration, we need to follow a series of steps while considering the rules and minimizing the time.

Our current configuration has the red block on top of orange, orange on top of yellow, and yellow on top of blue.\n\n2. **Unstack Red from Orange**: \n   - Time taken: 1 minute.\n   - Reason: Red block is on top of the orange block, preventing the orange block from moving.\n3. **Put Down Red Block**:\n   - Time taken: 1 minute.\n   - Reason: Once red is unstacked, put it aside to clear space for handling other blocks.\n4. **Unstack Orange from Yellow**:\n   - Time taken: 1 minute.\n   - Reason: Orange block is on top of the yellow block, preventing it from being placed on the blue block.\n5. **Stack Orange on Red**:\n   - Time taken: 1 minute.\n   - Reason: Temporarily move the orange block on top of the red block to work on rearranging the blocks.\n6. **Unstack Yellow from Blue**:\n   - Time taken: 1 minute.\n   - Reason: Yellow needs to be free to eventually place it on the orange, so unstack it from blue.\n7. **Put Down Yellow Block**:\n   - Time taken: 1 minute.\n   - Reason: Place yellow temporarily aside to complete the optimal arrangement.\n8. **Unstack Orange from Red**:\n   - Time taken: 1 minute.\n   - Reason: Now, we need orange back free to place it on the blue block as per the goal.\n9. **Stack Orange on Blue**:\n   - Time taken: 1 minute.\n   - Reason: Orange block is placed on blue as per the goal configuration wishes.\n10. **Pick Up Yellow**:\n    - Time taken: 1 minute.\n    - Reason: Lift the yellow to place on the orange.\n11. **Stack Yellow on Orange**:\n    - Time taken: 1 minute.\n    - Reason: Final placement to match the goal state.\n\nThe total time required is 11 minutes following this plan.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red orange)  \n(put-down red)  \n(unstack orange yellow)  \n(stack orange red)  \n(unstack yellow blue)  \n(put-down yellow)  \n(unstack orange red)  \n(stack orange blue)  \n(pick-up yellow)  \n(stack yellow orange)  ",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal with the minimum time, we need to strategically move the blocks according to the given constraints. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The red block is on top of the blue block, and we need the blue to be the second from the top after the transformation. Hence, first, we need to unstack the red block from the blue block, as the red block is currently clear.\n\n2. After unstacking the red block, we need to put it down, clearing our hand because we need to free up the blue block to eventually reposition it.\n\n3. Now, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, but we need the orange block to be clear first, which eventually will be the second from the bottom. So, we unstack the yellow block from the orange block.\n\n4. After that, we stack the yellow block onto the red block because the yellow block needs to be the top block on the red block in the final configuration.\n\n5. After stacking the yellow block on the red block, we pick up the orange block since we are holding nothing and the orange block is clear.\n\n6. The next step is to stack the orange block on top of the yellow block. The orange block is now being the second block from the bottom as desired in its final position.\n\n7. With the orange block properly positioned, we pick up the blue block.\n\n8. Finally, we need to place the blue block on top of the orange block to complete the stack indicating blue on orange, making the blue second from the top in the final stack.\n\nThis sequence of operations will achieve the desired configuration in the minimum time.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red blue) (put-down red) (unstack yellow orange) (stack yellow red) (pick-up orange) (stack orange yellow) (pick-up blue) (stack blue orange)",

        "answer": "To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully manipulate the blocks to achieve the desired configuration. We begin with the following initial conditions: the red block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is on the table. Our goal is to have the blue block on top of the yellow block, the orange block on top of the blue block, and the yellow block on top of the red block.\n\n1. **Unstack the red block from the blue block**: Since the red block is clear, we can unstack it from the blue block, which takes 1 minute.\n2. **Put down the red block**: With the red block unstacked, we put it down to make our hand empty and use it for other actions, taking another 1 minute.\n3. **Unstack the blue block from the orange block**: Next, we unstack the blue block, which is now clear with the red block removed. This takes 1 minute.\n4. **Put down the blue block**: We put down the blue block to free our hand again, taking another minute.\n5. **Unstack the orange block from the yellow block**: Now we unstack the orange block from the yellow block, as it's clear after moving both the red and the blue blocks. This action takes 1 minute.\n6. **Put down the orange block**: After unstacking, we put down the orange block, which takes another 1 minute.\n7. **Pick up the yellow block**: With the orange block removed, we pick up the yellow block, which is now clear. This takes 1 minute.\n8. **Stack the yellow block on top of the red block**: After picking up the yellow block, we stack it on top of the red block, taking 1 minute.\n9. **Pick up the blue block**: Our hand is now free, and the blue block is clear so we pick it back up, taking 1 minute.\n10. **Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block**: With the blue block picked up, we stack it on the yellow block, completing another action in 1 minute.\n11. **Pick up the orange block**: Finally, the orange block is clear, and we can pick it up, which takes 1 minute.\n12. **Stack the orange block on top of the blue block**: Lastly, we stack the orange block on top of the blue block, taking the final 1 minute.\n\nThe total time to execute this new plan is 12 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)",

We start with the yellow block being clear and the hand empty.\n2. Unstack the yellow block from the red block, as this is the only clear block we can move. This takes 1 minute.\n3. Put down the yellow block, freeing the red block to be moved later. This takes an additional minute (total 2 minutes).\n4. Next, unstack the red block from the orange block. We need the red block to be clear and accessible to later stack the blue block upon it. This takes another minute (total 3 minutes).\n5. Put down the red block to clear the path to the orange block. This adds another minute (total 4 minutes).\n6. Unstack the orange block from the blue block to have all individual blocks separated and clear for re-stacking. This takes another minute (total 5 minutes).\n7. Put down the orange block, which clears our hand for further movement. This takes another minute (total 6 minutes).\n8. Pick up the blue block, as the blue block must be moved to its new location first. This takes an additional minute (total 7 minutes).\n9. Stack the blue block on top of the red block, which is now on the table. This occupies one minute (total 8 minutes).\n10. Now, pick up the yellow block in preparation to put it on top of the newly placed blue block. This takes another minute (total 9 minutes).\n11. Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block, which is now in the correct position. This takes an additional minute (total 10 minutes).\n12. Finally, pick up the orange block to complete the final move. This takes one minute (total 11 minutes).\n13. Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block, finalizing the arrangement. This step takes one more minute (total 12 minutes).\n\nFollowing these steps, we have successfully rearranged the blocks to meet the goal configuration.

        "answer": "To solve the problem, we need to rearrange the blocks so that the red block is on top of the orange block and the orange block is on top of the yellow block, starting from the current configuration. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block. This step is necessary because the yellow block is currently on top of the orange block, preventing any further moves involving the orange block. (1 minute)\n2. Put down the yellow block on the table. Now that it's not needed immediately, we can set it aside to free our hand. (1 minute)\n3. Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block. We need to access the orange block and place it above the yellow block eventually. (1 minute)\n4. Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block, which should now be sitting clear on the table from step 2. This achieves part of the goal configuration with the orange on top of the yellow. (1 minute)\n5. Unstack the blue block from on top of the red block. The blue block needs to be removed to access the red block for the final arrangement. (1 minute)\n6. Put down the blue block on the table as it is not part of the final desired configuration. (1 minute)\n7. Pick up the red block.

        "answer": "INFERENCE_HERE\n\nInitially, the red block is clear and the hand is empty. The red block is on top of the orange block, which is on the blue block. The yellow block is on the table. To achieve the goal of having the yellow block on top of the orange block, the following steps are taken:\n\n1. Unstack the red block from on top of the orange block. This will make the orange block clear. It takes 1 minute.\n2. Put down the red block to have the hand empty, freeing it up for further actions. It takes 1 minute.\n3. Pick up the yellow block from the table. Now the yellow block is held and ready to be stacked. It takes 1 minute.\n4. Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block to achieve the goal condition. It takes 1 minute.\n\nThe plan follows the constraints and efficiently achieves the goal with a total time of 4 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red orange) (put-down red) (pick-up yellow) (stack yellow orange)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal configuration, the following steps are needed:\n\n1. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block**: The yellow block is initially on top of the orange block, and to achieve the final configuration, the yellow block must be placed on top of the red block. Therefore, unstack the yellow block from the orange block. Time: 1 minute.\n\n2. **Put down the yellow block**: The yellow block is unstacked from the orange block, thus it needs to be put down to free the hand. Time: 1 minute.\n\n3. **Pick up the red block**: Now, the red block is clear and can be picked up from the table to assist with achieving the final stacking order. Time: 1 minute.\n\n4. **Stack the red block on top of the yellow block**: Place the red block on top of the clear yellow block. This step accomplishes part of the final goal configuration. Time: 1 minute.\n\n5. **Pick up the blue block**: The blue block is initially on the table and is clear, so it can be picked up. Time: 1 minute.\n\n6. **Stack the blue block on top of the red block**: Place the blue block on top of the red block. This arrangement fulfills another part of the final goal configuration. Time: 1 minute.\n\n7. **Pick up the orange block**: The orange block is clear and on the table, ready to be picked up. Time: 1 minute.\n\n8. **Stack the orange block on top of the blue block**: Finally, place the orange block on top of the blue block to complete the goal configuration.

Initially, the blue block is on top of the orange block, and the yellow block is on top of the red block. The red and orange blocks are on the table, and both the blue and yellow blocks are clear, meaning they have no blocks on top of them and are not being held.\n\nThe steps to achieve the goal, ensuring we adhere to the constraints and minimizing the time, would be as follows:\n\n1. Since the blue block is currently on top of the orange block and it is clear, we will unstack the blue block from the orange block. This takes 1 minute.\n2. Put down the blue block on the table. Now both the blue block and yellow block are clear. This takes an additional 1 minute.\n3. The yellow block is on top of the red block, and since it is clear, we will unstack the yellow block from the red block. This takes 1 minute.\n4. Put down the yellow block on the table next to the blue block. Now the red block is clear. This takes 1 minute.\n5. Pick up the red block from the table. The red block is now in hand and ready to be stacked. This takes 1 minute.\n6. Stack the red block on top of the blue block. Now the blue block is no longer clear. This takes 1 minute.\n7.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the red block is on top of the orange block and the orange block is on top of the yellow block, we need to follow a series of logical actions given the initial conditions.\n\nINFERENCE:\n1. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block**: The orange block is currently on top of the blue block, and since the orange block is already clear, we can perform this action to free the blue block.\n2. **Stack the orange block on top of the red block**: The red block is on the table and clear, and now we hold the orange block. So, we stack the orange block on top of the red block, achieving part of the goal\u2014a stack of red and orange blocks.\n3. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block**: The blue block was under the orange block initially and is now clear to be unstacked from above the yellow block.\n4. **Put down the blue block**: Once we unstack the blue block, we need to set it aside by putting it down on the table to move on to the next step.\n5. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the red block**: To reposition it onto the yellow block, we unstack it from the red block where it was initially placed.\n6. **Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block**: Now that the orange block has been unstacked and the yellow block is clear, we can stack the orange block onto the yellow block to achieve the second part of the goal.\n7. **Pick up the red block**: Since the red block needs to be moved and is currently clear, we pick it up.\n8. **Stack the red block on top of the orange block**: Finally, we stack the red block on top of the newly formed stack with the orange block on top of the yellow block, completing the goal state.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack orange blue)\n(stack orange red)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack orange red)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)",

I put down the blue block on the table beside the red block, taking another minute.

        "answer": "[PLAN]\nSince the goal is to have the red block on top of the blue block and the blue block on top of the yellow block, we initially note that the current order of blocks does not directly fit our goal. The blue block is clear on top of the red block which is on top of the orange and so forth down to the yellow block on the table. \n\nFirst, we need to unstack the blue block from the red block, put down the blue block on the table freely.

        "answer": "[PLAN]\nFirstly, the orange block needs to be on top of the red block. Currently, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, which is on top of the blue block, and the blue block is on top of the red block. Therefore, the order from the top to the bottom is Orange -> Yellow -> Blue -> Red. \n\nTo achieve the goal, we need to move these blocks such that the orange block is directly on top of the red block, resulting in the order Orange -> Red. \n\nStart by unstacking the orange block from the top of the yellow block. \nPut down the orange block on the table as it cannot be directly placed on the red block yet.\nNext, unstack the yellow block from the top of the blue block, because it is blocking the orange from being stacked on the red directly. \nPut down the yellow block on the table.\nProceed with unstacking the blue block from the top of the red block, clearing the way for the orange block to be directly stacked on the red block.\nPut down the blue block on the table.\nPick up the orange block again as our aim is to stack it on the red block.\nFinally, stack the orange block on top of the red block, completing the task. \n\nThe steps above account for each necessary block move and achieve the goal of having the orange block placed on top of the red block with minimal moves.\n\nThe total time to execute the plan is 7 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)",

        "answer": "Initially, we have the following setup: the red block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, and the orange block is on the table. Our goal is to rearrange the blocks such that the orange block is on top of the blue block, and the yellow block is on top of the orange block.\n\nTo accomplish this:\n\n1. **Unstack the red block from on top of the blue block**: Since the red block is clear, we can unstack it without any constraint. After this action, hold the red block in hand.\n\n2. **Put down the red block**: With the red block in hand, place it aside on the table or in another location to free up our hand while keeping the area clear.\n\n3. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block**: Now that the blue block is clear, unstack it to hold it in hand.\n\n4. **Put down the blue block**: Similar to the red block, place the blue block elsewhere to free up the hand.\n\n5. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block**: With the yellow block being clear, we can unstack it and hold it in hand.\n\n6. **Stack the yellow block on top of the red block**: Since we eventually want the yellow block on top of the orange which will be on top of blue, stack the yellow block temporarily on the red block.\n\n7. **Pick up the orange block**: The orange block is now clear and can be picked up.\n\n8. **Stack the orange block on top of the blue block**: Move the orange block onto the blue block as per the goal condition.\n\n9. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block**: This allows us to correctly position the yellow block.\n\n10. **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block**: Finally, place the yellow block on top of the orange block, achieving the desired goal configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)\n(unstack yellow red)\n(stack yellow orange)",
