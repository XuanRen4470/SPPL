        "answer": "To solve the problem, we start by examining the initial condition: the red block is clear and on the table, while the blue block is also clear but situated on top of the orange block. \n\n**Goal Analysis**: We want the red block on top of the blue block, the blue block on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block on top of the orange block.\n\n**Initial Plan Execution**:\n1. **Unstack Blue from Orange**: Since the goal is to have blue directly under red, blue must be unstacked from orange (the blue block becomes clear afterward).\n   \n2. **Stack Blue on Red**: Now that blue is clear, and since red is also clear on the table, we pick up blue and stack it on red. After this stack, red is not clear anymore.\n   \n3. **Pick-Up Yellow**: Since both blue and red are not clear, we should focus on creating space; we pick yellow because it is on the table and clear, intending to place it above orange.\n\n4. **Stack Yellow on Orange**: Stack yellow on top of orange to ensure that the orange block becomes the final base layer on the table.\n   \n5. **Unstack Blue from Red**: Backtracking, we need to clear the current stack of red and blue to address our final stacking requirement (yellow should be on orange, next under blue). Thus, unstack blue from red, making both blocks clear.\n\n6. **Stack Blue on Yellow**: Place blue on top of this newly formed stack (yellow block is clear atop of orange).\n\n7. **Pick-Up Red**: With blue resting on yellow and blue being clear, pick up red to achieve the final goal.\n\n8. **Stack Red on Blue**: Finally, place red on top of blue to fulfill the complete goal of having red on top of blue, blue on top of yellow, and yellow on top of orange.\n\nThrough these steps, we systematically reorder the blocks using permissible actions to reach the target goal layout efficiently.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(unstack blue red)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)",

Initially, the yellow block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, and the orange block is on top of the red block. \n\n1. The first step is to make the yellow block clear, which means unstacking the yellow block from the blue block. Since the hand is empty and the yellow block is clear, this move is valid.\n2. We then put down the yellow block.\n3. The next step is to make the blue block clear by unstacking it from the orange block and then putting it down.\n4. Subsequently, unstack the orange block from the red block and then stack the orange block on top of the yellow block.\n5. Next, pick up the red block to place it on top of the blue block, ensuring the blue block is clear and on the table.\n6.

The blue block is clear, and the goal is to arrange the blocks such that red is on top of yellow and orange is on top of blue. \n\n1. Since the blue block is on top of red and we need to rearrange the blocks, we start by unstacking the blue block from the red block and putting it down, making the red block clear.\n   \n2. Next, to place the red block on top of the yellow block, which is initially under it, we must unstack the red block from the yellow block and stack the red block on the blue block, which is currently on the table.\n   \n3. With the red block resting on the blue block, we now make the yellow block free by unstacking it from the orange block, as the end goal requires the orange block needs to be on top of the blue block.\n\n4. Therefore, we need to put the yellow block down, leaving the red block on the blue block, and rearrange any further arrangements needed.\n   \n5. Next, we must unstack the red block from the blue block to further position it above the yellow block. \n\n6. After that, we stack the red block on top of the yellow block.

        "answer": "INFERENCE:\n\n1. Initially, the red block is on top of the yellow block and is clear, making it a valid starting point for unstacking. Our goal is to arrange blocks such that the blue block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the red block. \n\n2. First, we unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block to make the yellow block clear and to put the red block on the table. This is necessary because the yellow block needs to be in the middle of our desired stack configuration.\n\n3. We then put down the red block because our hand needs to be empty for any subsequent actions related to the yellow block, and placing the red block down satisfies the requirement of putting it on the table.\n\n4. Next, we pick up the yellow block, which by now is clear and on the table, allowing us to perform this action.\n\n5. Stack the yellow block on top of the red block, placing the yellow block in its desired position in the final arrangement.\n\n6. Since the orange block is currently clear and on top of the blue block, we can now unstack the orange block from the blue block. \n\n7. We put down the orange block on the table, enabling us to pick up the blue block next.\n\n8. With the blue block now clear and on the table after being freed from the orange block, we can pick it up.\n\n9.

        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE \n\nTo reach the goal where the red block is on top of the orange block and the blue block is on top of the red block, start by arranging the blocks according to the initial conditions and execute the following steps:\n\n1. Since both the blue and yellow blocks are clear and our hand is empty, we first consider the arrangement of the blocks as the blue block is on top of the orange block and the yellow block is on top of the red block. Both orange and red blocks are on the table.\n\n2. For the first goal, to have the red block on top of the orange block, we observe that red is the base in its current setup, so we need to directly place it above the orange block. Hence:\n\n   - Unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block (yellow is clear, red is underneath).\n   - Put down the yellow block.\n\n3. Now, the red block is clear, with nothing above, it remains on the table. We need to switch the blue and red blocks\u2019 positions to reach our second goal. Blue is clear and should eventually become the last block on top of the red one. Proceed with the following:\n\n   - Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block (blue is clear, orange is underneath).\n   - Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block (yellow is clear from previous steps and on the table).\n   - Pick up the red block (it's clear after the yellow was moved and is on the table).\n   - Stack the red block on top of the orange block (orange is on the table and clear).\n   - Unstack the blue block from the previous position on the yellow block (blue is on top of yellow and clear).\n   - Stack the blue block on top of the red block (red is clear after being stacked on orange).\n\nThis sequence ensures that we successfully reach the desired stacked configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack yellow red)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(stack blue red)",

Initially, the orange block is clear and the hand is empty. The blocks are stacked as follows: the orange block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the red block, the red block is on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is on the table.\n\n2. To reach our goal, the red block needs to be on top of the yellow block. It is already there, so we don't need to move it.\n\n3. The orange block needs to be on top of the red block. Therefore, we must first remove the orange block from its current position on top of the blue block. We can unstack the orange block from the blue block.\n\n4. After unstacking, we have the orange block in hand. We should put it down for now, so the hand is empty.\n\n5. Next, unstack the blue block from the red block. Now we have the blue block in hand.\n\n6. Put down the blue block on the table to free the hand.\n\n7. With the hand free, unstack the red block from the yellow block. Now we hold the red block.\n\n8. Stack the red block on top of the temporarily-put-down orange block to partially achieve the required order for these two blocks.\n\n9. We must now deal with placing the yellow block on the blue block. Pick up the yellow block from the table.\n\n10. Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n\n11. At this stage, the stack of orange and red needs to be repositioned. Unstack the red block, leaving the orange block clear.\n\n12. Stack the red block on top of the yellow block to complete the goal condition for red over yellow.\n\n13.

        "answer": "INFERENCE:\n\nTo achieve the goal where the red block is on top of the orange block and the orange block is on top of the blue block, we must first understand the current stack setup. Initially, the yellow block is on top of the blue block, which is on top of the red block, which is in turn on top of the orange block. Our hand is empty, and we can see that the yellow block is clear, meaning it's our starting point for actions as it can be moved immediately.\n\nFirst, we unstack the yellow block from the blue block and put the yellow block down to free up the blue. Next, we unstack the blue block from the red block and put down the blue block. Then we unstack the red block from the orange block. At this stage, the red block is clear. To move towards the goal, we must stack the red onto the cleared yellow, temporarily.\n\nWith the red block on top of the yellow, we proceed to pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the blue block. This setup aligns the orange on blue, matching the part of the goal where the orange sits on the blue. Afterward, we unstack the red from yellow and finally stack it on top of the orange.

Our hand is empty, so we can unstack the red from the orange.\n\n3. Now, since we want to achieve an intermediate position to place the red block on another table to free the yellow block from the current structure, stack the red block on top of the blue block as the blue block is clear.\n\n4. Next, unstack the orange block from the yellow block. As our hand is empty, we can unstack the orange from the yellow.\n\n5.

Next, we stack the blue block on top of the yellow block, which is currently on the table.\n\nFinally, we need to position the orange block on top of the red block.

Initially, the blue block is stacked on top of the orange block, and the yellow block is stacked on top of the blue block.\n2. We want to achieve the state where the orange block is sandwiched between the blue block (on top) and the yellow block (below), and eventually, the yellow block is on the red block.\n3. Starting with unstacking the yellow block from the blue block will make the yellow block clear. This allows us to proceed with the plan to stack the yellow block on the red block.\n4. Next, unstack the blue block from the orange block (since our hand is empty after the previous action).\n5. Place the blue block temporarily on the table.\n6. Pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the yellow block, which you previously placed on the red block, making the arrangement yellow over red and blue over orange.\n7.

Now, the blue block is no longer clear.\n3. **Unstack the red block from the orange block.** This is necessary to position both blocks correctly since the red needs to be at the bottom.\n4. **Put down the red block.** We need the hand to stack other blocks.

The hand is currently empty.\n\n1. **Unstack Yellow from Red**: Since yellow is clear and on top of the red block (which is on the table and thus not clear for stacking), unstack the yellow block from the red block, making both yellow and red available for new operations.\n2. **Put Down Yellow**: Place the Yellow block somewhere else on the table to make both the red and yellow blocks individually accessible for future operations.\n3. **Unstack Orange from Blue**: Next, unstack the clear orange block from the blue block, since the orange is also clear and needs to be used below the red block eventually.\n4. **Stack Orange on Yellow**: Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block, as per the goal's requirement where orange should be above yellow.\n5. **Pick Up Red**: With the red block now clear on the table, having removed the yellow from it earlier, pick up the red block.\n6. **Stack Red on Orange**: Finally, stack the red block on top of the orange block, completing the required goal configuration.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack yellow red)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)",

Since the orange block is on top of the yellow block, we unstack the orange block from the yellow block and put it down on the table.\n\nNow, to place the blue block on top of the orange block, we must have the blue block clear.

The orange block needs to be stacked onto the yellow block, which is on the table. This requires first unstacking the orange block from on top of the red block. The hand is empty, and the orange block is currently clear since the only restriction on visibility is blocks above it, which it does not have in this scenario.\n\n2.

Next, unstack the red block from on top of the orange block since our goal requires it atop the yellow block.\n   - Unstack the red block from the orange block.\n   - Stack the red block on top of the yellow block (since both are clear, perform the stack).\n\n3. Now the red-yellow configuration matches the goal. We focus on the blue-orange arrangement.\n   - Pick up the orange block as it is now clear on the table (from the previous steps).\n   - Stack the orange block on top of the blue block (since blue is clear).\n\nWith these steps, we achieve the goal condition for both object arrangements as required.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow red)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack red orange)\n(stack red yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)",
