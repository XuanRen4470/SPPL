        "answer": "To address the problem and achieve the goal where the blue block is on top of the orange block and the yellow block is on top of the red block, let's evaluate the initial conditions and carefully outline each step.\n\n### Initial Conditions:\n- The blue block is clear.\n- The orange block is clear.\n- The yellow block is clear.\n- The hand is empty.\n- The yellow block is on top of the red block.\n- The red block is on the table.\n- The blue block is on the table.\n- The orange block is on the table.\n\n### Goal:\n- The blue block is on top of the orange block.\n- The yellow block is on top of the red block.\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Pick up the blue block**:\n   - Since the blue block is clear and the hand is empty, you can pick it up.\n\n2. **Stack the blue block on top of the orange block**:\n   - As the orange block is clear, you can stack the blue block onto it. This achieves the first goal.\n\n3. **Pick up the yellow block**:\n   - Since the yellow block is clear and the hand is now empty, you can pick it up.\n\n4. **Place the yellow block back on the red block**:\n   - The red block is clear since nothing is on top of it.\n\nThis straightforward sequence maintains focus on achieving both stipulated goals. Let's verify this plan:\n\n### Verification:\n- **Begin with:** \n  - Hand is empty.\n  - Blue, yellow, and orange blocks are clear.\n\n- **Step 1**:\n  - Pick up the blue block.\n  - Now, blue block is being held, hand is no longer empty.\n\n- **Step 2**:\n  - Stack the blue block on top of the orange block.\n  - The hand is empty again and the blue block is no longer clear.\n  \n- **Step 3**:\n  - Pick up the yellow block.\n  - Yellow block is held, hand is not empty.\n\n- **Step 4**:\n  - Place the yellow block on the red block.\n  - Hand is empty, achieving the second goal state.\n\n### Final State Achieved:\n- The blue block is on top of the orange block.\n- The yellow block is on top of the red block.\n- Hand is empty.\n\nThe operations outlined ensure the required outcome is met successfully.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)",

Let's analyze the current configuration and the required setup.\n\n### Initial Conditions:\n- The orange block is clear.\n- The yellow block is clear.\n- The hand is empty.\n- The red block is on top of the blue block.\n- The orange block is on top of the red block.\n- The blue block is on the table.\n- The yellow block is on the table.\n\n### Goal:\n- The red block is on top of the blue block.\n- The blue block is on top of the yellow block.\n- The orange block is on top of the red block.\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the red block.**\n   - This frees up the red block so that the orange block is no longer on top of it.\n\n2. **Put down the orange block.**\n   - This action clears the hand, making it empty for the next moves.\n\n3. **Unstack the red block from on top of the blue block.**\n   - This frees the blue block and prepares the red block for repositioning.\n\n4. **Stack the red block on top of the orange block.**\n   - This places the red block in a temporary position for the rearrangement.\n\n5. **Pick up the blue block.**\n   - This allows the blue block to be moved to its position in the desired stack order.\n\n6. **Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block.**\n   - This ensures that the blue block is correctly placed on top of the yellow block, meeting one of the goal stack conditions.\n\n7. **Unstack the red block from on top of the orange block.**\n   - This preps the red block for its final placement on the already arranged blue and yellow stack.\n\n8. **Stack the red block on top of the blue block.**\n   - This completes the main goal of having the red block properly placed on top of the blue block.\n\n9. **Pick up the orange block.**\n   - This action picks the orange block back up for its final positioning.\n\n10. **Stack the orange block on top of the red block.**\n    - This final move meets the goal configuration by placing the orange block on top of the red block, completing the overall stacking sequence.\n\n### Summary of Steps:\n1. Unstack the orange block from on top of the red block.\n2. Put down the orange block.\n3. Unstack the red block from on top of the blue block.\n4. Stack the red block on top of the orange block.\n5. Pick up the blue block.\n6. Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block.\n7. Unstack the red block from on top of the orange block.\n8. Stack the red block on top of the blue block.\n9. Pick up the orange block.\n10. Stack the orange block on top of the red block.\n\nThis step-by-step plan ensures that the final configuration matches the goals defined.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange red)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack red blue)\n(stack red orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(unstack red orange)\n(stack red blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)",
