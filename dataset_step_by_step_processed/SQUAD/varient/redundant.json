First, let's identify how many records Beyonc\u00e9 has sold as a solo artist. According to the context, Beyonc\u00e9 has sold over 118 million records as a solo artist. So, as a solo artist, she has sold 118 million records. This is the first key number we need to remember: 118 million records as a solo artist.\n\n2. Next, we need to consider Beyonc\u00e9's record sales with Destiny's Child. The context tells us that she sold a further 60 million records with Destiny's Child.

Step by step, we have reaffirmed that the tribute aspect links directly back to her mother's name before marriage, which is \"Beyinc\u00e9.\"\n\n7. Therefore, it is clear beyond doubt and through careful repetition that Beyonc\u00e9's name is derived from and is a tribute to, in homage of, or an acknowledgment of, her mother's maiden name.\n\n8. Repeatedly, the idea reinforced is that Beyonc\u00e9 was named in honor of her mother's maiden surname, which she carried before becoming Celestine Ann \"Tina\" Knowles.\n\n9.

Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyonc\u00e9 later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyonc\u00e9's father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyonc\u00e9's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyonc\u00e9's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group.

The context describes the early activities and developments of Beyonc\u00e9's group, Girl's Tyme. Initially, the group was formed when Beyonc\u00e9, Kelly Rowland, and LaTavia Roberson joined together with other girls. They rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston. This indicates they were involved in talent shows even at a young age.\n\nThe context specifically states that an R&B producer named Arne Frager played an essential role in advancing their exposure to a larger national audience. After encountering the group, Arne Frager took the initiative to bring Girl's Tyme to his Northern California studio. By doing so, he directly facilitated their participation in Star Search, which was the largest talent show on national TV at that time.\n\nThe information provided explicitly mentions that Arne Frager placed them in Star Search. This is stated clearly in the sentence specifying Frager's action. Thus, it is not inferred or implied but directly stated that Arne Frager was responsible for placing the group in the talent show.\n\nTherefore, by parsing through each relevant detail and focusing on the direct references made in the context, we can conclude that the decision to place Beyonc\u00e9's group in Star Search was made by Arne Frager. This conclusion comes from a careful reading of the text, identifying Frager's pivotal role in their path to the national TV talent show.\n\nFinal Answer: Arne Frager",

First, the context states that Destiny's Child released a song in 1997. They had a song on the soundtrack of the movie \"Men in Black\" which was \"Killing Time.\" However, this song is described as their major label debut, but not as a major hit.\n\n2. Next, the context tells us about their self-titled debut album released in the following year, which is 1998. Within this debut album, they scored their first major hit with the song \"No, No, No.\" \n\n3. The context emphasizes that \"No, No, No\" was indeed their first major hit song by alluding to the fact that the song contributed to establishing Destiny's Child as a significant act in the music industry. The song \"No, No, No\" also earned them awards, including Best R&B/Soul Album of the Year, Best R&B/Soul or Rap New Artist, and Best R&B/Soul Single.\n\n4. Further validating the song\u2019s significance, the context makes it clear that subsequent hits such as \"Bills, Bills, Bills\", \"Jumpin' Jumpin'\", and \"Say My Name\" from their second album are mentioned. These are described separately, emphasizing that \"No, No, No\" was the initial breakthrough.\n\n5. Therefore, by retracing the release timeline and identifying from the context which song held the distinction of being their first major hit, it is clear that \"No, No, No\" was Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s first major song hit.\n\n6. Repeating the process, once again, the chronology clarifies that \"No, No, No\" was the first major hit after differentiating their first major label debut from their first major hit.\n\nNow, consolidating the synthesis of all steps leads to the confirmation of the first major hit, eliminating ambiguity, and indicating \"No, No, No\" without doubt.\n\nFinal Answer: No, No, No",
