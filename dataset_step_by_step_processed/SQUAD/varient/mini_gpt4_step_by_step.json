She publicly revealed their marriage in a video montage at the listening party for her third studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce, in Manhattan's Sony Club on October 22, 2008. I Am... Sasha Fierce was released on November 18, 2008 in the United States. The album formally introduces Beyonc\u00e9's alter ego Sasha Fierce, conceived during the making of her 2003 single \"Crazy in Love\", selling 482,000 copies in its first week, debuting atop the Billboard 200, and giving Beyonc\u00e9 her third consecutive number-one album in the US. The album featured the number-one song \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" and the top-five songs \"If I Were a Boy\" and \"Halo\". Achieving the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career, \"Halo\"'s success in the US helped Beyonc\u00e9 attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s. It also included the successful \"Sweet Dreams\", and singles \"Diva\", \"Ego\", \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" and \"Video Phone\". The music video for \"Single Ladies\" has been parodied and imitated around the world, spawning the \"first major dance craze\" of the Internet age according to the Toronto Star. The video has won several awards, including Best Video at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards, the 2009 Scottish MOBO Awards, and the 2009 BET Awards. At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for nine awards, ultimately winning three including Video of the Year. Its failure to win the Best Female Video category, which went to American country pop singer Taylor Swift's \"You Belong with Me\", led to Kanye West interrupting the ceremony and Beyonc\u00e9 improvising a re-presentation of Swift's award during her own acceptance speech. In March 2009, Beyonc\u00e9 embarked on the I Am... World Tour, her second headlining worldwide concert tour, consisting of 108 shows, grossing $119.5 million.\n\nWhat is the answer?\n\nPlease inference first, then provide the final answer (text span) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",

In the context, it is stated that in November 2014, Forbes reported that Beyonc\u00e9 earned $115 million in that year. It also specifies that this amount was more than double her earnings in 2013.\n\nTo find out how much her earnings were in 2013, we should consider the phrase \"more than double.\" If we denote her earnings in 2013 as X, then we can establish the following relation:\n\n$115 million > 2 * X\n\nFrom this inequality, if earnings in 2014 are more than double the earnings in 2013, we can express 2013's earnings as:\n\nX < $115 million / 2\nX < $57.5 million\n\nThus, her earnings in 2013 were less than $57.5 million. The question specifically asks how much more her earnings were compared to the year prior, which implies we need to look at the increase from her 2013 earnings to her 2014 earnings.\n\nSince it's mentioned that her 2014 earnings were more than double those of 2013, we can interpret the phrase \"more than double\" as confirming that her earnings increase is significant, but does not provide a specific numeric increase. Therefore, we summarize that her earnings in 2014 ($115 million) were certainly greater than double her earnings in 2013 but we cannot calculate the exact figure without more data.\n\nConsequently, the answer to the question based on the inference process is that her 2014 earnings were indeed significantly higher than in 2013 by an amount that exceeds the example of \"more than double.\"\n\nFinal Answer: more than double her earnings",

The key points are that Chopin arrived in Paris in 1831 and began using the French versions of his given names. This indicates that he adapted his name to fit in with the culture and language of his new home. Furthermore, the context notes that after receiving French citizenship in 1835, he traveled on a French passport, further emphasizing his integration into French society.\n\nSince he used the French versions of his given names but did not feel completely at home with the language or culture, we conclude that he would have chosen a distinctly French form of his name.
