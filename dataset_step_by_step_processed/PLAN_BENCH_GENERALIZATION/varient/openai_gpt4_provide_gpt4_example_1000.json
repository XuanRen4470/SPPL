Pick up the cyan block and stack it on top of the orange block.\n\n4. **Silver Block**: Initially clear and required to be below the blue block. Pick it up and stack it on the cyan block, creating the necessary base configuration.\n\n5. **Blue Block**: Clear and to be stacked on the silver block. This action builds the part of the goal stack where the red block will eventually sit on top of the blue block.\n\n6. **Red Block**: Clear and positioned to be atop the blue block within the stack. Pick up the red block and stack it on the blue block.\n\n7. **White Block**: Clear and ultimately needs to be on top of the red block, making use of its position to complete this part of the goal stack.

        "answer": "To achieve the desired block configuration based on the provided initial conditions and goals, let's determine the correct sequence of actions. The initial conditions indicate that all blocks are clear and on the table, thus they can be picked up in any order. We can begin by establishing the foundation block stacks and progressing upward from there, ensuring that we only place new blocks on others that are already clear.\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Start the foundation of the tower**:\n   - Pick up the gold block.\n   - Stack the gold block on top of the magenta block. (The magenta block is clear and on the table.)\n   \n2. **Continue building upward**:\n   - Pick up the silver block.\n   - Stack the silver block on top of the gold block. (The gold block is clear now.)\n   - Pick up the green block.\n   - Stack the green block on top of the silver block. (The silver block is now clear.)\n   - Pick up the yellow block.\n   - Stack the yellow block on top of the green block. (The green block is also clear now.)\n   - Pick up the red block.\n   - Stack the red block on top of the yellow block. (The yellow block is clear now.)\n   - Pick up the white block.\n   - Stack the white block on top of the red block. (The red block is clear now.)\n   - Pick up the violet block.\n   - Stack the violet block on top of the white block. (The white block is clear now.)\n   - Pick up the orange block.\n   - Stack the orange block on top of the violet block. (The violet block is clear now.)\n   - Pick up the cyan block.\n   - Stack the cyan block on top of the orange block. (The orange block is clear now.)\n   - Pick up the black block.\n   - Stack the black block on top of the cyan block. (The cyan block is now clear.)\n   - Pick up the blue block.\n   - Stack the blue block on top of the black block. (The black block is now clear.)\n\nThis sequence carefully manages the constraints, ensuring that all actions are performed with an empty hand when picking up or unstacking.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up gold)  \n(stack gold magenta)  \n(pick-up silver)  \n(stack silver gold)  \n(pick-up green)  \n(stack green silver)  \n(pick-up yellow)  \n(stack yellow green)  \n(pick-up red)  \n(stack red yellow)  \n(pick-up white)  \n(stack white red)  \n(pick-up violet)  \n(stack violet white)  \n(pick-up orange)  \n(stack orange violet)  \n(pick-up cyan)  \n(stack cyan orange)  \n(pick-up black)  \n(stack black cyan)  \n(pick-up blue)  \n(stack blue black)  ",
