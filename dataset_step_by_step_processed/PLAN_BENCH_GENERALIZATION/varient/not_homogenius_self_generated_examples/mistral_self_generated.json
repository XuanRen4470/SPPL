        "answer": "To solve this problem and achieve the goal of stacking the blocks in the specified order, we need to carefully plan our actions while adhering to the restrictions outlined.\n\nWe start with all blocks on the table and clear, which aligns with the initial conditions provided. The goal arrangement requires the following stack:\n\n- Gold block on top of Green\n- Green block on top of Black\n- Black block on top of Red\n- Red block on top of Silver\n- Silver block on top of Magenta\n\nLet's break down the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. The first goal is to place the Silver block on top of the Magenta block. We pick up the Silver block (since it's clear) and stack it on the Magenta block.\n\n2. Next, we need to place the Red block on top of the Silver block. We pick up the Red block and stack it on the Silver block.\n\n3. Now, place the Black block on top of the Red block. We pick up the Black block and stack it on the Red block.\n\n4. For the Green block on top of the Black block, we pick up the Green block and stack it on the Black block.\n\n5. Finally, we place the Gold block on top of the Green block by picking up the Gold block and stacking it on the Green block.\n\nEach step respects the rule that a block can only be picked up if it\u2019s clear and on the table, and each stacking action puts a block on top of another clear block.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up silver)\n(stack silver magenta)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red silver)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black red)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green black)\n(pick-up gold)\n(stack gold green)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the white block on top of the red block and the gold block on top of the white block, we need to consider the initial conditions and apply the available actions while respecting the restrictions. Here's the step-by-step inference:\n\n1. Start with the initial conditions where the red, white, and gold blocks are all clear, and the hand is empty. Ensure the red block is on the table, the white block is on the table, and the gold block is on the table.\n\n2. Pick up the white block since it is clear and on the table. Now, the white block is being held, and the hand is no longer empty.\n\n3. Stack the white block on top of the red block. The white block is clear, and the red block is clear and on the table. Once stacked, the red block is no longer clear. The hand becomes empty after stacking.\n\n4. With the white block on top of the red block, pick up the gold block. The gold block is clear and on the table. Now, the gold block is being held, and the hand is no longer empty.\n\n5. Stack the gold block on top of the white block. The white block is clear. Once the gold block is stacked, the white block is no longer clear. The hand becomes empty after stacking.\n\nWith these steps, the desired block configuration is achieved.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up white) (stack white red) (pick-up gold) (stack gold white)",

The primary goal is to achieve the final configuration by sequentially stacking the blocks per the stated goals. Here is the inferred plan:\n\n1. The magenta block must be on top of the silver block. Thus, we pick up the magenta block and stack it on top of the silver block.\n2. The black block needs to be on top of the blue block. So, we pick up the black block and stack it on top of the blue block.\n3. The green block must then be on top of the black block. We pick up the green block and stack it on top of the black block.\n4. Subsequently, the yellow block needs to be stacked on top of the green block. We pick up the yellow block and stack it on top of the green block.\n5. For the red block to be on top of the white block, we pick up the red block and stack it on top of the white block.\n6. Next, we stack the white block on top of the yellow block. We pick up the white block and stack it on the yellow block.\n7. The cyan block has to be on top of the red block. So, we pick up the cyan block and stack it on top of the red block.\n8. The red block, already stacked on the white, is further taken with cyan stacked on it. We manage this sequence by having previously stacked the red/cyan correctly. \n9. The orange block is then stacked on top of the cyan block. Thus, we pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the cyan block.\n10. Completing the circular interdependence, silver is stacked on the orange, remembering it began as an underlying table block possible during silver/magenta resolution.\n\nThe plan follows all restrictions of lifting, unstacking, putting down, and stacking while ensuring all block contacts are clear and satisfy the table-clearness rule.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up black)\n(stack black blue)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green black)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow green)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red white)\n(pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange cyan)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver orange)\n(pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta silver)",

        "answer": "[PLAN]\n\nINFERENCE_HERE\n\nThe initial conditions have all blocks as clear and on the table, and the hand is empty. To achieve the goals, we need to stack the blocks in the specified order.\n\n1. We begin with the gold block, which we pick up and stack on top of the blue block. This step is critical since the gold block needs to support the orange block eventually.\n2. Next, we pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the gold block.\n3. After that, we pick up the silver block and stack it on top of the orange block. Now, the orange block is no longer clear, but it achieves the goal that silver is on top of orange.\n4. The red block is picked up and stacked on top of the silver block. This achieves the goal that the red block is on top of silver.\n5. Next, we pick up the white block and stack it on top of the red block.\n6. We then pick up the magenta block and stack it on top of the white block. \n7. The black block is then picked up and stacked on top of the magenta block.\n8. Finally, the green block is picked up and stacked on top of the black block, thus completing the required configurations.\n\nThis plan meticulously follows each step in ensuring the goal conditions are met while respecting the constraints of only moving a clear block and having an empty hand before picking up or unstacking.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up gold)  \n(stack gold blue)  \n(pick-up orange)  \n(stack orange gold)  \n(pick-up silver)  \n(stack silver orange)  \n(pick-up red)  \n(stack red silver)  \n(pick-up white)  \n(stack white red)  \n(pick-up magenta)  \n(stack magenta white)  \n(pick-up black)  \n(stack black magenta)  \n(pick-up green)  \n(stack green black)",

Next, we need to stack the red block on top of the violet block. The red block is clear and on the table, so we pick up the red block. The violet block, now on top of the magenta block, is clear since there are no blocks above it. We stack the red block on top of the violet block.\n\n3.

We have three blocks on the table: red, black, and silver, each of which is clear, meaning no block is on top of another.

Pick up the white block and stack it on top of the black block.\n   - Now the white block is on top of both black and cyan.\n\n3. Pick up the gold block and stack it on top of the white block.\n   - This completes the stack with white, black, and cyan, as required.\n\n4. Next, pick up the magenta block and stack it on top of the gold block.\n   - Stacks magenta onto the block order for next set.\n\n5. Pick up the blue block and stack it on top of the magenta block.\n   - Adds blue to the stack in the correct order.\n\n6. Pick up the red block and stack it on top of the blue block.\n   - Places red block properly on the correct stack order.\n\n7.

Then, we stack the gold block on top of the cyan block:\n   - Pick up the gold block and stack it on the cyan block.\n3. For the next stack, we will arrange the magenta and gold blocks:\n   - Pick up the magenta block and stack it on the gold block.\n4. Continue with arranging the green and magenta blocks:\n   - Pick up the green block and stack it on the magenta block.\n5. Next, stack the orange block on top of the green block:\n   - Pick up the orange block and stack it on the green block.\n6. Now, stack the yellow block on the orange block:\n   - Pick up the yellow block and stack it on the orange block.\n7.

Here's the breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. Since the red block and the cyan block are clear and accessible on the table, we can start by picking up the cyan block. The hand is empty initially, allowing us to execute this action.\n\n2. Next, we stack the cyan block onto the black block. Since both blocks were initially on the table and the black block is clear, this action is permissible, and the cyan block is placed on the black block.\n\n3. Now, pick up the red block. With the hand empty after the previous action of stacking, we can pick up the red block as it is also clear on the table.\n\n4. Finally, stack the red block on top of the cyan block. This action satisfies our final goal state, as the red block tops the cyan block, which in turn is on the black block.\n\nThis plan adheres to all action restrictions and achieves the desired arrangement.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up cyan)  \n(stack cyan black)  \n(pick-up red)  \n(stack red cyan)",

        "answer": "To construct the stacks as laid out in the new goal, we need to follow a sequential stacking and unstacking of blocks adhering to the provided guidelines.\n\nFirst, we pick up the black block and stack it on top of the magenta block. This is a necessary first move as the magenta block has no blocks on top of it, making it clear and available for stacking.\n\nNext, we pick up the gold block and stack it on top of the black block. As the black block is now successfully positioned, the gold block can be moved next as it's a clear block.\n\nAfterward, we pick up the red block and stack it on the gold block because the red block needs to be in position under the orange block eventually.\n\nThen, the orange block gets picked up and stacked on top of the red block, ensuring that the red block is positioned correctly followed by the orange block.\n\nThen, the silver block is picked up and stacked on top of the orange block. Consequently, positioning silver on top of orange as per the goal condition.\n\nNext, the violet block will be picked up and stacked on top of the silver block.\n\nIn the following step, the cyan block will be picked up and stacked on top of the violet block.\n\nLastly, the green block gets picked up and stacked on top of the cyan block.\n\nThis sequencing ensures all blocks are moved strategically without violating the conditions provided.

The initial conditions indicate that all blocks are clear and on the table, which allows us to pick them up in any desired order.\n\n1. To start, we need the green block to be at the bottom of one stack. This means we should first pick up the green block and stack it on top of the black block:\n   - pick up the green block\n   - stack the green block on top of the black block\n\n2. Next, we need the cyan block to be above the green block:\n   - pick up the cyan block\n   - stack the cyan block on top of the green block\n\n3. The white block is to be on top of the cyan block:\n   - pick up the white block\n   - stack the white block on top of the cyan block\n\n4. Next, the violet block should be on top of the white block:\n   - pick up the violet block\n   - stack the violet block on top of the white block\n\n5. Another stack starts with the blue block at the bottom with the violet block on top of it:\n   - pick up the blue block\n   - stack the blue block on top of the violet block\n\n6.

Start with the violet block, as it needs to be at the base of the stack involving cyan. Pick up the violet block.\n\n2. Stack the violet block on top of the cyan block, making the violet block no longer clear.\n\n3. Next, take the red block, which needs to be stacked on top of violet. Pick up the red block.\n\n4. Stack the red block on top of the violet block, making it the next block in the sequence.\n\n5. The magenta block needs to be placed on top of the red block. Pick up the magenta block.\n\n6. Stack the magenta block on top of the red block.\n\n7. For the orange block, which should go on top of the magenta block, pick up the orange block.\n\n8. Stack the orange block on top of the magenta block, forming the next part of the desired stack.\n\n9. Finally, the yellow block should be placed at the top of the stack, on top of the orange block.

The ultimate goal is to arrange the blocks in a stack with a specific order:\n\n1. Start by picking up the red block and stacking it on top of the violet block. This action ensures that the red block is on top of the violet block as required.\n\n2. Next, pick up the silver block and stack it on top of the red block. This ensures that silver is on top of red.\n\n3. After that, pick up the white block and stack it on top of the silver block, satisfying the condition that white is on top of silver.\n\n4. Pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the white block. This fulfills the requirement for orange to be on top of white.\n\n5. Then, pick up the green block and stack it on top of the orange block. Thus, green will correctly be on top of orange.\n\n6. Finally, pick up the magenta block and stack it on top of the green block. This completes the sequence with magenta on top of green.\n\nThroughout each step, after stacking one block on top of another, the previously clear block becomes obscured by the newly stacked block. We follow the picking and stacking actions such that each block is placed on a clear block, and the hand is empty before picking up the next block.\n\nThis strategic series of actions leads directly to the desired final arrangement.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(pick-up red)\n(stack red violet)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver red)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white silver)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange white)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green orange)\n(pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta green)",

Next, we pick up the green block since it's clear and still on the table. We then stack the green block on top of the blue block, as the blue is on top of the silver and thus clear.\n\n3. Finally, we pick up the yellow block from the table, which is also clear, and stack it on top of the green block, because green is on top of blue and remains clear.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully arranged the blocks in the desired configuration while adhering to the rules outlined previously. \n\nFinal Answer:\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue silver)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow green)",

We can do this by following a systematic approach as described below.\n\nInitial conditions state that the blue, black, violet, silver, and gold blocks are clear and on the table with an empty hand. The goal is to arrange these blocks such that:\n\n1. The blue block is on top of the gold block.\n2. The silver block is on top of the blue block.\n3. The violet block is on top of the silver block.\n4. The black block is on top of the violet block.\n\n**Inference Process:**\n\n1. **Pick up the blue block:** The blue block is clear and on the table. Since the hand is empty, we can pick it up.\n\n2. **Stack the blue block on top of the gold block:** The gold block is clear and on the table. While holding the blue block, stack it on top of the gold block.\n\n3. **Pick up the silver block:** The silver block is clear and on the table. Since the hand is empty after stacking, we can pick it up.\n\n4. **Stack the silver block on top of the blue block:** The blue block is clear (even though it's on top of the gold block, nothing is stacked on it). While holding the silver block, stack it on top of the blue block.\n\n5. **Pick up the violet block:** The violet block is clear and on the table. Since the hand is empty after stacking, we can pick it up.\n\n6. **Stack the violet block on top of the silver block:** The silver block is clear (it's on top of the blue block with no blocks on it). While holding the violet block, stack it on top of the silver block.\n\n7. **Pick up the black block:** The black block is clear and on the table.

Begin by stacking blocks that are at the bottom of their respective stacks. This means starting with the cyan block, which will be an important base for subsequent steps.\n\n2. Pick up the cyan block (clear and on the table) and stack it on the silver block (clear and on the table). This sets the base for the yellow block.\n\n3. Pick up the yellow block and stack it on top of the cyan block, placing it correctly above the cyan.\n\n4. Pick up the orange block and proceed to stack it on top of the yellow block, finalizing this part of the required setup.\n\n5. Next, pick up the gold block and stack it on top of the orange block. At this moment, the bottom part of the needed structure is complete.\n\n6. We then move to the next set by picking up the green block and stacking it on the gold block, in turn setting up the position for the black block.\n\n7. Pick up the black block and stack it on top of the green block. This allows space for the red block to be placed correctly.\n\n8. Pick up the red block and stack it on top of the black block.\n\n9.

Here's how we can do it:\n\nFirst, we observe that the goals imply several dependencies:\n\n- The blue block needs to be on the black block, which means the black block has to be on the table first or already stacked on a desirable block.\n- The orange block has to be atop the magenta block.\n- The white block should be on top of the yellow block.\n- The magenta block needs to be on the violet block.\n- The black block should ultimately be on the gold block.\n- The cyan block must finally sit on the green block, with the green block on the blue block.\n\nNow, considering these dependencies, here's the stack sequence using the operation constraints:\n\n1. Pick up the white block from the table and stack it on the yellow block.\n2. Pick up the silver block and stack it on the white block.\n3. Pick up the violet block and stack it on the silver block.\n4. Pick up the magenta block and stack it on the violet block.\n5. Pick up the orange block and stack it on the magenta block.\n6. Pick up the gold block and stack it on the orange block.\n7. Pick up the black block and stack it on the gold block.\n8. Pick up the blue block and stack it on the black block.\n9. Pick up the green block and stack it on the blue block to form the partial green-blue stack.\n10.

Initially, all blocks are clear and our hand is empty, allowing us to pick up the blocks that are on the table.\n\n2. Start by picking up the yellow block because it's initially clear and can be stacked on the green block.\n\n3. Pick up the blue block next, as the yellow block is now stacked on the green block, and stack the blue block on top of the yellow block.\n\n4.

Start by picking up the clear cyan block and stack it on top of the silver block. This ensures that we have one pair completed as per the goal.\n\n2. Next, pick up the violet block since it is initially clear and stack it on top of the cyan block. This creates another part of the desired stack where the violet block is on top of cyan which is on silver.\n\n3. Pick up the magenta block which is also clear at the start and stack it on top of the violet block. Now, magenta is on top of violet, which is on top of cyan, which is on silver, maintaining our stack.\n\n4. Proceed by picking up the green block (which is initially clear) and stack it on top of the magenta block. This way, green is on top of magenta which is on top of violet, maintaining our stack.\n\n5.

Let's address each step while ensuring we comply with the described rules.\n\nInitially, all blocks (orange, white, gold) are on the table and clear, with the hand being empty. The goal requires the blocks to be stacked in such a way that the orange block is atop the white block, which in turn is atop the gold block.\n\n1. Start by picking up the white block from the table. The white block is clear and the hand is empty, allowing us to pick it up.\n2. Stack the white block on top of the gold block since the gold block is initially clear.\n3. Next, pick up the orange block from the table. The orange block is clear, so we can pick it up with our now empty hand.\n4. Finally, stack the orange block on top of the white block. The white block, which is now on top of the gold block, is clear.\n\nAfter these operations, the blocks are arranged such that the orange block is on top of the white block, and the white block is on top of the gold block, thereby fulfilling the goal.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up white)\n(stack white gold)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange white)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal, we need to arrange the blocks using the available actions while adhering to the restrictions provided. \n\n1. Begin by analyzing the initial conditions and the goal state. We are given that the hand is empty and several blocks are clear and on the table. \n\n2. The goal is to achieve a specific order for the blocks: the blue block is on top of the green block, the orange block is on top of the white block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block, the white block is on top of the red block, and the green block is on top of the orange block.\n\n3. To achieve this, we need a sequence of actions (picking up, stacking, etc.) that transitions the blocks from their initial clear and table states to the desired stacked configuration.\n\n4. We break down the process as follows:\n\n- Pick up the white block and stack it on top of the red block to establish the white-red sequence.\n- Pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the white block to create the orange-white-red order.\n- Pick up the green block and stack it on top of the orange block to achieve the green-orange-white-red alignment.\n- Pick up the blue block and stack it on top of the green block to form the blue-green-orange-white-red sequence.\n- Finally, pick up the yellow block and stack it on top of the blue block to achieve the final goal sequence: yellow-blue-green-orange-white-red.\n\nThis sequence of steps respects all restrictions, such as clearing conditions and hand limitations.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up white)\n(stack white red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange white)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue green)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)",

        "answer": "To achieve the stated goal, we will follow a step-by-step plan to stack the blocks according to their desired order. This must adhere to the provided constraints about block placement.\n\nFirst, observe that the green block needs to be on top of the cyan block. So, we start by selecting the green block, which is clear and on the table, and we stack it onto the cyan block.\n\nNext, the orange block needs to be placed on top of the green block. Therefore, we pick up the orange block and stack it on the green block.\n\nFollowing this, the white block should be placed on the orange block. Thus, we pick up the white block and stack it on the orange block.\n\nThen, the gold block is to be positioned on top of the white block. So, we pick up the gold block and stack it on the white block.\n\nNext, the blue block is to go on top of the gold block. Therefore, we pick up the blue block and stack it on the gold block.\n\nAfter that, the black block needs to be placed on the blue block. So, we pick up the black block and stack it on the blue block.\n\nThe red block is to be stacked on the black block, so we do exactly that.\n\nThen, the yellow block must go on top of the red block. Therefore, we pick up the yellow block and stack it on the red block.\n\nThe magenta block needs to be placed on the yellow block. So, we pick up the magenta block and stack it on the yellow block.\n\nSubsequently, the silver block is required to be on top of the magenta block. Hence, we pick up the silver block and stack it on the magenta block.\n\nFinally, the violet block needs to be on the silver block. So, we pick up the violet block and stack it on the silver block.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure the blocks are arranged according to the specified goal.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up green)\n(stack green cyan)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange green)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white orange)\n(pick-up gold)\n(stack gold white)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue gold)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red black)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta yellow)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver magenta)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet silver)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal, we need to stack the blocks in the desired order according to the restrictions provided.\n\n1. Start with the stack which is at the bottom of the desired configuration. That would be the cyan block on the green block: \n   - Pick up the cyan block (since it's clear and on the table).\n   - Stack cyan on the green block (as the green block is clear).\n\n2. Next, we need to complete the second stack with yellow on top of cyan:\n   - Pick up the yellow block (since it's clear and on the table).\n   - Stack yellow on the cyan block (since now the cyan block is no longer clear, but was clear at the time of stacking).\n\n3. Now, complete this stack by adding black on top of yellow:\n   - Pick up the black block.\n   - Stack black on the yellow block.\n\n4. Repeat a similar stacking approach for the other set. Start with the violet block on top of the black as it forms a part of the base for the second distinct stack:\n   - Pick up the violet block.\n   - Stack violet on the black block.\n\n5.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal, we need to follow the specific order of actions while adhering to the given restrictions. The initial condition provides all blocks as clear and on the table, allowing us to start stacking according to the desired goal.\n\n1. To begin, we pick up the yellow block, which is clear and on the table, then stack it on the silver block, making yellow the top block of the yellow-silver stack.\n2. Next, pick up the blue block and stack it on top of the yellow block. This creates the blue-yellow-silver stack.\n3. We continue by picking up the white block and stacking it on the blue block, resulting in the white-blue-yellow-silver stack.\n4. Then, we pick up the cyan block and stack it on the white block, forming the cyan-white-blue-yellow-silver stack.\n5. Now, pick up the green block and stack it on the cyan block, completing the green-cyan-white-blue-yellow-silver stack.\n6. After that, we pick up the red block and stack it on the green block, leading to the red-green-cyan-white-blue-yellow-silver stack.\n7.

        "answer": "To achieve the desired goal, we need to carefully stack the blocks following the restrictions given. Let's analyze the steps needed:\n\n1. We start with an empty hand and all blocks clear on the table.\n\n2. First, we pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the white block.\n   - This achieves the part of our goal where the orange block is on top of the white block.\n\n3. Next, we pick up the yellow block and stack it on top of the orange block.\n   - This completes the section of our goal with the yellow block on top of the orange block.\n\n4. Then, we pick up the silver block and stack it on top of the yellow block.\n   - This satisfies the goal by having the silver block on top of the yellow block.\n\n5. After that, we pick up the blue block and stack it on top of the silver block.\n   - This completes the part of our goal with the blue block on top of the silver block.\n\n6. Finally, we pick up the green block and stack it on top of the blue block.\n   - This ensures the green block is on top of the blue block, completing the final requirement of our goal.\n\nBy following these steps, each block is placed according to the goal, and all actions adhere to the restrictions laid out.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up orange)\n(stack orange white)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue silver)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green blue)",
