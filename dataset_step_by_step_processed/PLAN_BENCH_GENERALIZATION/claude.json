Since the gold block is clear and on the table, we can pick it up and stack it on magenta.\n\n3. Next, the silver block needs to go on top of the gold block.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal state, we need to build a stack with the following order from bottom to top: orange, gold, violet, black, silver. Let's start with the bottom of the stack:\n\n1. The gold block needs to be on top of the orange block, so we should start by picking up the gold block and stacking it on the orange block.\n\n2. Next, we need to place the violet block on top of the gold block.\n\n3. Then, we'll put the black block on top of the violet block.\n\n4. Finally, we'll place the silver block on top of the black block.\n\nThis approach ensures that we build the stack in the correct order to achieve the desired goal state.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up gold)\n(stack gold orange)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet gold)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black violet)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver black)",
