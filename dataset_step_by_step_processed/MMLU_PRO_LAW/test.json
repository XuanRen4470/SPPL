After exploding, the aerial bomb emits a spectacular rainbow fireworks display that is seen for miles around. One afternoon, a 10-year-old boy and a few friends went to the fairgrounds to see the circus. After paying their admission, they were about to enter the \"big top\" when the boy came upon an aerial bomb lying on the ground. Ignorant of what the object really was, but in an exploratory mood, the boy applied a match to the fuse of the fireworks device. It exploded and seriously injured the boy. After the accident, and before the parents of the boy had retained a lawyer, the adjuster for the circus's insurance carrier contacted the parents several times, trying to negotiate a settlement of their claim against the circus. On each occasion, the adjuster told the parents there was no need for them to hire an attorney because the applicable civil code did not provide for recovery in such a situation. The adjuster was aware that this information was blatantly false. He also warned the parents that unless they accepted his offered settlement of $5,000, they would receive nothing. For over a month, the adjuster continued to harass the parents. Outraged by the adjuster's actions, the parents sought the advice of a neighbor who recommended that they consult an attorney. The parents went ahead and retained a lawyer who subsequently negotiated a $250,000 settlement with the adjuster's insurance company for the claims relating to the boy's injury from the aerial bomb.

As the woman remembers it, at the time the written contract was formed, the parties orally agreed that if the car required any additional servicing above that detailed in the contract, it would be included in the $1,000 fee.

        "question": "The state registrar of elections refused to put a candidate's name on the ballot because the registrar believed that the candidate was not a resident of the state. The registrar contended that Article I, Section 2 of the U. S. Constitution specifically required a candidate for the House of Representatives \"be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen. \" As a consequence, the candidate filed suit in state court against the registrar of elections seeking to have her name placed on the ballot. The state court ruled in her favor and determined that the candidate did, in fact, qualify as a resident of the state. The registrar appealed the decision to the state supreme court which, in turn, affirmed the lower court ruling. Thereafter, the candidate's name was placed on the ballot. After a hotly contested election, the candidate narrowly defeated the incumbent. However, at the time that the candidate was to be seated as a House member, the House of Representatives held hearings on her qualifications and eligibility. By a two-thirds vote, the House determined that the candidate was not a resident of the state at the time of her election and refused to seat her. The candidate then brought suit in federal district court against the Speaker and other officers of the House, seeking back pay and an order that she be seated in the House of Representatives. The defendants demurred, claiming lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument supporting the defendants' demurrer?\nAvailable options are the following:\nA: The suit should have been brought as an original action in the U. S. Supreme Court.\nB: The federal court cannot intervene because it would disrupt the separation of powers.\nC: Under Article III of the Constitution, the federal courts are not empowered to render advisory opinions.\nD: The candidate lacks standing to sue because she was never officially a member of the House of Representatives.\nE: The case should have been filed in the state court where the original residency determination was made.\nF: The federal court lacks jurisdiction because the House of Representatives has exclusive authority to determine the qualifications of its members.\nG: The case is moot because the term of office for which the candidate was elected has already ended.\nH: There is no case or controversy between the candidate and the officers of the House of Representatives.\nI: The candidate's claims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\nJ: The case presents a nonjusticiable political question.",

        "question": "A housing corporation owned farmland and prepared a development plan to divide the land into 100 lots and create a residential community on the farmland tract. The Declaration of Covenants created the community association, as an administrative entity, to which the residential community lot owners would pay dues, and which would administer and enforce the regulations and restrictions recited among the covenants. One of the restrictions set forth in the Declaration of Covenants provides that the lots be used only for single-family residences, and that no trade, commerce, or business may be conducted in any single-family residence. The Declaration of Covenants gives the community association the right to assign all of its rights, powers, titles, easements, and estates granted to it under the Declaration of Covenants. The community association assigned \"all the rights, powers, titles, easements, and estates granted to or conferred upon it by the Declaration of Covenants\" to a municipal corporation, the city. The community association was then terminated. A chef, the owner of lot 18 in the residential development, proposes to convert his single-family dwelling into a massage parlor. The city asserts an action against the chef to recover money damages. Which of the following is the best argument for the chef?\nAvailable options are the following:\nA: The restraint on alienation of his land is invalid.\nB: The Declaration of Covenants is unenforceable because it is overly restrictive.\nC: The Declaration of Covenants does not explicitly prohibit the conversion of single-family dwellings into businesses.\nD: The chef has the right to use his property as he sees fit, regardless of the Declaration of Covenants.\nE: The benefit is in gross; hence, the burden cannot run.\nF: The chef was not aware of the Declaration of Covenants when he bought the property.\nG: The assignment of rights to the city was invalid because the community association was terminated.\nH: The burden is in gross; hence, the benefit cannot run.\nI: The city is not in privity of estate with community association.",

        "question": "A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the sale of computer printer ink cartridges in plastic bags. In accordance with the new law, all ink cartridges within the state must be sold in paper cartons that are recyclable. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all ink cartridges used in the state was packaged in plastic bags. Of that total, 75% of the ink cartridges was packaged outside the state, while 25% was packaged by companies in-state. The legislature passed the bill at the strong urging of the paper industry. It was estimated that one paper company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill. Ironically, the new law even received strong support from environmentalists who believed that recyclable paper would help prevent littering. Assume that the state Supreme Court adjudges the law to be unconstitutional on the grounds that it violates the contracts clauses of both the federal and the state Constitutions. The contracts clause of the state Constitution is similar to the one in the federal Constitution. The court so held because, in its judgment, the statute retroactively impairs the ability of plastic bag packagers to honor their existing contracts for the sale of ink cartridges packaged in plastic bags. The state attorney general now seeks review of this decision in the U. S. Supreme Court. How should the U. S. Supreme Court rule on this case?\nAvailable options are the following:\nA: Refuse to review this case on the merits because there is an adequate and independent state ground for the decision rendered below.\nB: Affirm the decision on the merits with respect to the federal constitutional issue, but reverse the decision with respect to the state constitutional issue.\nC: Reverse the decision on the merits with respect to the state constitutional issue because the federal constitutional holding rendered below makes such a state constitutional decision unnecessary.\nD: Refuse to review the case because the state Supreme Court's decision does not conflict with any federal law or constitutional provision.\nE: Affirm the decision on the merits with respect to the federal constitutional issue and abstain from reviewing the state constitutional issue.\nF: Reverse the decision because the law does not retroactively impair the ability of plastic bag packagers to honor their existing contracts for the sale of ink cartridges packaged in plastic bags.\nG: Affirm the decision on the merits with respect to the state constitutional issue and abstain from reviewing the federal constitutional issue.\nH: Affirm the decision on the merits with respect to both the federal and state constitutional issues because the state constitution must substantially conform with the federal constitution on this issue.\nI: Reverse the decision on the grounds that the state law does not violate the contracts clause of the federal Constitution.\nJ: Reverse the decision because the state law is a reasonable regulation of commerce and does not violate the contracts clauses of the federal and state constitutions.",

        "question": "A city enacted an ordinance prohibiting the singing and chanting of songs from 1:00P. M. to 1:00A. M. by two or more persons if such noise is audible off the premises where the singing takes place. The ordinance expressly exempted from its purview the singing or chanting of religious songs. After the ordinance was enacted and went into effect, several college students were walking down the street on their way to a victory celebration following a big college football game. They began loudly chanting, \"We're number 1. . . we're number 1. \" One of the residents who lived on the street was greatly disturbed by the noise and reported the incident to the police, who were immediately summoned to the scene. The students who engaged in the chanting were arrested and charged with violating the ordinance. The students who were prosecuted now bring suit challenging the constitutionality of the city ordinance. Which of the following would constitute their WEAKEST argument against enforcement of the city ordinance?\nAvailable options are the following:\nA: The ordinance deprives persons of their liberty without due process of law because the ordinance is not related to any legitimate community interest.\nB: The ordinance is unjust as it discriminates against those who are not religious.\nC: The ordinance is not fair because it only applies to two or more persons, thus single individuals can create noise without consequence.\nD: The ordinance deprives the persons of the equal protection of the laws by impermissibly distinguishing between religiously inspired singing and all forms of singing.\nE: The ordinance directly contradicts the students' right to celebrate their college's victory.\nF: The ordinance deprives persons of their freedom of expression, in violation of the First andFourteenth Amendments.\nG: The ordinance is biased against persons who can't sing or chant religious songs.\nH: The ordinance is invalid as it fails to consider the cultural importance of chanting and singing in a group.\nI: The ordinance is not applicable because it was after a football game, a special occasion.\nJ: The statutory language of the ordinance is vague and overbroad since it attempts to encompass all forms of singing.",

On the woman's first day at work, she noticed a sign in the kitchen area that read:\"IMPORTANT NOTICE TO ALL EMPLOYEESEmployees are not permitted to smoke during working hours. Any employee who is found to be in violation of this policy will be fined $50 for the first offense; $100 for the second offense; and fired for the third violation. \"The woman, who was a smoker, read the notice, but did not object or make any comment regarding the restaurant's nonsmoking policy. For six months, the woman worked at the restaurant and never smoked during business hours. One afternoon, the woman was working when an armed robber stormed into the restaurant. He pointed a pistol at the woman and demanded all the money from the cash register. Frightened and panic stricken, the woman handed over the money and then collapsed. Moments later, she regained consciousness and then smoked a cigarette while she regained her composure. Thereafter, the woman resumed her duties for the rest of the day. The next week, however, when the woman received her pay check, she noticed that the restaurant had deducted $50 from her check. A note was attached indicating that the woman was being fined for smoking during business hours. Although the woman protested, the restaurant refused to make any waiver and stood by its policy.

        "question": "A manufacturer of electric motors formerly produced motors that utilized as a coolant a chemical substancethat was later discovered to be highly toxic. During its manufacturing operations, the manufacturer negligentlyallowed quantities of this substance to leak into the soil. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) orderedthat the premises, now owned by an appliance repair shop, be decontaminated. This order, and the subsequent cleanup efforts, received a high level of attention in the local media. An employee of the appliance repair shop has sued the manufacturer in negligence for damages for emotionaldistress. The employee claims to have suffered the distress as a consequence of learning that she has beenexposed for five years, while employed by the appliance repair shop at the premises affected by the EPA order,to the toxic contamination that has existed there. Her complaint does not allege that her emotional distress issevere, that the manufacturer's conduct was extreme and outrageous, or that she has suffered any physicalconsequences. In that action the manufacturer has filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief maybe granted. What is the manufacturer's best argument in support of that motion?\nAvailable options are the following:\nA: The manufacturer cannot be held liable for negligence because the toxic substance was not known to be harmful at the time of the leakage.\nB: The manufacturer cannot be held liable because the EPA is responsible for the decontamination process.\nC: The employee cannot sue the manufacturer because she was not exposed to the toxic substance directly from the manufacturer.\nD: The repair shop employee's emotional distress is not alleged to be severe.\nE: The complaint does not allege that the manufacturer was aware of the toxicity of the substance at the time of the leakage.\nF: The complaint does not allege that the manufacturer's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\nG: The complaint does not allege that the employee suffered any financial loss due to the emotional distress.\nH: The complaint does not allege that the repair shop employee suffered any physical consequences.\nI: The repair shop employee's proper remedy is in a claim against the repair shop, the occupier of thepremises during the period of her alleged exposure.\nJ: The employee cannot sue the manufacturer because she was not employed by the manufacturer at the time of the exposure.",

        "question": "A state has had a tremendous influx of retired people in recent years. There has been considerable concern among state health officials who foresee that many of the senior citizens will become victims of price gouging on certain medical supplies and services. In an attempt to curb such fraudulent sales practices, the state legislature has enacted a law prohibiting the sale of hearing aids by non-physicians. The measure provides, however, that all non-physician sellers who are presently engaged in the business of selling hearing aids will not be affected. Assume that after the statute goes into effect, a non-physician moves to the state and wants to open a business selling hearing aids. After being advised that the state law prohibits him from doing so, he brings suit challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The most likely result is that the state law will be declared\nAvailable options are the following:\nA: unconstitutional, because it violates the commerce clause, since Congress has plenary power to regulate any activity that has any appreciable effect on interstate commerce.\nB: unconstitutional, because it creates an unfair trade barrier for non-physicians wanting to start a business in the state.\nC: constitutional, as it aims to protect a vulnerable segment of the population from potential exploitation.\nD: constitutional, because there is a rational basis for distinguishing between non-physicians are not so engaged.\nE: unconstitutional, because it discriminates between non-physicians already in the business and those wanting to enter it.\nF: unconstitutional, because it restricts the rights of non-physicians to conduct a legitimate business.\nG: constitutional, because it falls under the state's power to regulate healthcare and related services.\nH: constitutional, because it does not infringe upon the rights of non-physicians not already in the business of selling hearing aids.\nI: constitutional, because a state has the power to regulate any phase of local business, even though such regulations may have some effect on interstate commerce, provided that Congress has not enacted legislation regarding the subject matter.",

        "question": "A man hired a videographer to film his daughter's wedding. The written contract entered included a \"payment clause,\" which provided that the videographer would be \"paid $10,000 for the filming and editing of a 60-minute video of the wedding and the reception. \" The man included in the contract a stipulation that the video would be filmed using high definition equipment. The contract made no other reference to compensation. Thereafter, the videographer filmed and edited the 60-minute video, using high definition equipment, and presented it to the man. The videographer then submitted to the man an invoice statement in the amount of $15,000. Besides the $10,000 contract figure, the bill included a $5,000 charge for the use of the high definition equipment. Denying any additional liability, the man sent the videographer a check for $10,000. The videographer then brought suit against the man to recover the additional $5,000. Which of the following arguments would be most persuasive to support the videographer's contention that when the written contract was executed, the man agreed to pay the videographer $5,000 for use of the high definition equipment in addition to the $10,000 fee?\nAvailable options are the following:\nA: The contract is open to interpretation and does not explicitly state that use of high definition equipment would be included in the $10,000 fee.\nB: The use of high definition equipment is a separate service and not included in the base fee for filming and editing.\nC: According to the customary trade practice of the video industry, a $10,000 fee for filming and editing means $10,000 in addition to a supplemental charge if high definition equipment is used.\nD: An oral agreement to that effect, if provable, would only supplement, not contradict, the \"payment clause\" as written.\nE: The man's stipulation for high definition equipment implies agreement to additional charges associated with the use of such equipment.\nF: The videographer can provide evidence of past clients who were charged separately for the use of high definition equipment.\nG: Assuming arguendo that the written \"payment clause\" was fully integrated and neither patently nor latently ambiguous, equitable considerations require admission of extrinsic evidence, if available, of the parties' intent, since the videographer would stand to lose $5,000 on the contract.\nH: Under the UCC, extrinsic evidence, if available, of additional terms agreed to by the parties is admissible unless such terms \"would certainly vary or contradict those contained in the document. \"\nI: The videographer had previously informed the man of the additional costs of using high definition equipment.\nJ: The videographer provided a service above and beyond the agreed upon terms, therefore justifying the additional cost.",

The retailer had to pay most of the expenses on the property, and had options for further extensions but not to purchase the property back. Within a few years, lessee's business grew and he wanted to tear down one of the buildings and attach a new building to his store. The investor refused to consent. Lessee filed suit asking for an order compelling compliance. Will the court likely order the investor to comply with the lessor's demands?\nAvailable options are the following:\nA: Yes, the lessee will be able to make the improvements without the investor's consent but the improvements will belong to the investor.\nB: No, because in every sale-leaseback agreement, there is a clause guaranteeing that the lessee cannot make improvements without the written consent of the investor.\nC: No, because the investor can deny any changes that they think will devalue the property.\nD: Yes, because the lessee's equity interest surpasses the investor's interest, giving the lessee the right to make improvements.\nE: Yes, because the lessee has the right to make alterations to improve business operations.\nF: Yes, since the lessee's business is growing and needs expansion, the investor should comply.\nG: Yes, because the lessee has the right to make changes as he is the one paying for the property.\nH: No, the investor has the final say in any changes to the property since they are the legal owner.\nI: No, it will preclude the lessee from making such drastic changes without the investor's consent.",

        "question": "Over the last several years, the economy of a state has substantially changed. The state's economy used to be based solely on heavy industry. However, the state legislature approved legalized gambling within the state. As a consequence, many casinos and new hotels were built and the state's economy boomed. These moves were often induced by the granting by the state of special tax benefits for the construction of new casinos and hotels under state statutes. Recently, however, neighboring states have legalized gambling and offered greater tax incentives to the gaming industry. As a result, many of the casino and hotel owners have begun to leave the state. The unemployment and social welfare benefits the state has had to pay have substantially increased, burdening the remaining casinos, and also making it difficult for the state to lower its taxes to remain competitive with other states. On account of this predicament, the state legislature passed, and the governor duly signed, an emergency bill into law. According to the statute, the state imposed a one cent tax on the playing of any slot machine in any gambling casino. Since virtually all the slot machines required a payment of either a dime, quarter, or dollar, the imposition of this tax required a major costly adaptation on each slot machine to allow for the deposit of the additional one cent tax. Although many casino owners have complained about the tax, their only alternative is to absorb the tax themselves and lose one cent per game. As a consequence of the tax, fewer slot machines are purchased in the state by the casino owners. No manufacturer of slot machines is located in the state. Which of the following constitutional provisions provide the strongest ground to attack the validity of the state tax bill?\nAvailable options are the following:\nA: The full faith and credit clause of Article IV, Section 1.\nB: The third amendment's prohibition against quartering soldiers.\nC: The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD: The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2.\nE: The establishment clause of the First Amendment.\nF: The contract clause of Article I, Section 10.\nG: The fourth amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.\nH: The tenth amendment's reservation of powers to the states.\nI: The commerce clause.\nJ: The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.",

        "question": "A rancher owned a 2,000-acre cattle ranch in a remote section of the state. For some time the rancher's cattle had been seized upon by roaming packs of wolves. In order to protect his livestock from these attacks, the rancher erected a fence around his property. In addition, the rancher installed electrical wiring on the fence. The wiring transmitted an electric current, which would emit a shock upon contact with the fence. Although the voltage was calculated to frighten animals away from the fence, it was of such low intensity that it posed no risk of injury to a human being, even a small child. Consequently, the rancher did not post any notice of the electrical wiring device. One day, a cowboy was riding his horse along the outskirts of the rancher's property, when a gust of wind blew his hat onto the fence. The cowboy, who had undergone major heart surgery, wore a pacemaker. When the cowboy touched the top of the fence to retrieve his hat, the electric current short- circuited his pacemaker, resulting in the cowboy's death by electrocution.

        "question": "On April 10, the owner of a golf course entered into an oral agreement with a gardener whereby the gardener promised to install all new sprinkler heads on the sprinkler system at the 18-hole golf course. In return, the owner promised to pay the gardener $2,400 upon completion of the job. Since a golf tournament was scheduled for the weekend of April 20 21, the gardener agreed to replace all the sprinkler heads no later than April 19. Before accepting the job, the gardener had inspected the golf course and determined that 240 sprinkler heads had to be replaced. By April 14, the gardener had installed 80 new sprinkler heads on the first six holes of the 18-hole golf course. That afternoon, however, the owner learned that the gardener had been adjudicated bankrupt on April 12, so he notified the gardener to discontinue the job. The next day, the owner hired a landscaper to complete the installation work at $8 per head. The landscaper installed the remaining 160 sprinkler heads and completed the work on April 19. Despite making reasonable efforts, the gardener was unable to find any gainful employment during the period. Also, the gardener's application for unemployment compensation was rejected at the same time. Which of the following statements, if found to be true, would provide the owner with legally justifiable grounds for discharging the gardener?\nAvailable options are the following:\nA: The gardener could not provide a warranty for the installation.\nB: The gardener was not insured to carry out the task.\nC: Half of the sprinkler heads installed by the gardener were determined to be defective, and the gardener refused to replace the sprinkler heads.\nD: The owner found a cheaper alternative to complete the job.\nE: The gardener was using subpar materials for the installation.\nF: The gardener had been adjudicated bankrupt onApril 12.\nG: The gardener had only completed 33 percent of the installation work when he was discharged.\nH: The contract between the owner and the gardener was not in writing.\nI: The gardener did not have a valid license to do the job.\nJ: The gardener failed to finish the job by April 19.",

The caller furnished the police with the address where the disturbance was taking place. When the police arrived at the home, they discovered the homeowner, bludgeoned to death. The murder weapon was a blood-stained baseball bat found near the victim's body. A subsequent investigation revealed that the homeowner had recently been separated from her husband who had since moved to another city. After questioning several of the victim's friends and relatives, the police concluded that the husband was a prime suspect in the murder.

Finding no one inside, they searched the apartment. Before leaving, the detectives took a box of cereal, which they planned to use for a fingerprint comparison. The prints from the cereal box matched those found on the baseball bat. The police provided the grand jury investigating the murder with the fingerprint comparison.

The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink in an appropriate space. A write-in candidate for the office of Attorney General is a Chinese-American. The candidate is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of Chinese voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered Chinese voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidates name along with the office of Attorney General. Since many native Chinese people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against the election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Thereafter, one of the candidate's opponents filed suit in state court seeking to prevent state election officials from counting any write-in ballots with stickers.

Two officers testified that they examined \"track\" marks on the defendant's arms and wrists, and that he admitted to past drug usage. The accused testified that he was not an addict and the marks were from an allergic reaction. The trial court instructed the jury that it could find him guilty on proof that he was an addict, without proof of drug usage. The jury did not believe the defendant's denials, and found him guilty based on the observed track marks. The court sentenced him to six months imprisonment. He appealed, claiming cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. Will the conviction likely be reversed on appeal?\nAvailable options are the following:\nA: Yes, because the statute makes it criminal to use illegal drugs, which constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.\nB: No, because the arrest is based on the regular use of illegal narcotics and is a proper concern of the criminal law.\nC: Yes, because the physical evidence is not enough to prove that the defendant is currently using drugs.\nD: No, because the jury found him guilty based on the evidence presented in the trial.\nE: Yes, because addiction is a medical condition and should be treated as such, not criminalized.\nF: No, because the state has the power to forbid the use of narcotics within its borders and that's what this statute does.\nG: Yes, because the statute punishes having the illness of drug addiction, which is like punishing someone for having a cold, and it is thus cruel and unusual punishment.\nH: No, because the defendant admitted to past drug usage, hence he is guilty.\nI: No, because the state has the right to protect its citizens from the harmful effects of narcotics.",
