Apparently, the co-defendants' investments had not been performing well in the economic downturn. The co-defendants, upset and humiliated by their firing, vowed to get back at the bank. As their revenge, they decided to plant a bomb in the bank and demand $2,000,000. After receiving the money, they would then reveal the location of the bomb and provide details for defusing it. The co-defendants agreed that the bank should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, the co-defendants consulted the Internet, where they found all the information they needed on how to build a bomb. They built the bomb and placed it in a supply closet. Shortly thereafter, they phoned the bank and made a demand for the money. They said a bomb was in the bank and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The bank refused to pay the money. Realizing that their plan had gone awry, they drove to the bank to attempt to defuse the bomb. As they were driving back to the bank, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people.

Thereupon, the commission member voted to approve the variance, thus making it possible for the developer to commence construction of the office building.

        "question": "After watching a television program about archery, a 15-year-old boy became very interested in that sport. He saved up some money to buy a bow and other archery equipment. He set up a target in his backyard in order to practice. He surrounded the target with stacks of hay bales to stop any arrows that missed the target. After practicing for a few weeks, the boy made great improvements in his technique and accuracy. While practicing one afternoon, however, the boy lost his balance just as he released an arrow. As a result, the arrow flew way off course, going over the target and all the hay bales and flying into a wooded area behind the boy's house. The boy assumed no one was in the woods, so he was relieved that the errant arrow would not hurt anyone. However, a hiker happened to be in the woods near the boy's house. As he paused for a moment to take a drink of water, the hiker suddenly saw something out of the corner of his eye. It was the stray arrow shot by the boy. Without even thinking about it, the hiker reflexively ducked out of the way.

One of the restrictions set forth in the Declaration of Covenants reads:\"There shall never at any time be erected, permitted, or maintained upon any part of the property any structure designed for or used as a saloon or place for the sale or manufacture of malt, vinous, or spirituous liquors. \"The Declaration of Covenants was duly recorded and was included in the deed taken by a teacher when he purchased lot 62 in the development. The teacher immediately recorded his deed. The teacher leased his home to a librarian for a term of one year. The lease included the same restrictions as those in the Declaration of Covenants and in the teacher's deed. The librarian immediately began to sell liquor on the premises during weekly \"after hours\" parties. The homeowners' association sues the librarian in an action for damages. Which of the following is the best argument for the librarian?\nAvailable options are the following:\nA: The homeowners' association has no authority over the librarian.\nB: The librarian is not in privity of contract with the homeowners' association.\nC: The homeowners' association failed to notify the librarian of the restriction.\nD: The librarian has the right to use the property as they see fit during the lease term.\nE: The restriction is considered void due to the other commercial activities in the vicinity.\nF: The Declaration of Covenants restriction is not legally binding.\nG: Other lots in the immediate vicinity are used for commercial purposes.\nH: The librarian was not aware of the Declaration of Covenants when signing the lease.\nI: The rule in Spencer's Case prevents the librarian from being liable.\nJ: The librarian is not in privity of estate with the teacher.",

The salesperson offered to sell the man 1,000 fire extinguishers for his hotel. The salesperson told the man that the cost of the fire extinguishers would be $35,000 (or $35 apiece), payable 90 days after delivery. The salesperson promised to have the fire extinguishers installed no later than April 15. On March 16, the man telephoned the salesperson and accepted the offer. The following day, the man mailed the following memo to the salesperson:\"Please be advised that I shall take a 15 percent discount for cash payment seven days after installation. \" The salesperson received the man's correspondence on March 20.

        "question": "A woman had spent many years converting her back yard to an authentic Japanese-style garden. Her garden had become a showplace for the neighborhood, and various civic groups and organizations frequently visited the woman's property to enjoy the beauty of the yard. Recently, the woman had read about a particular cymbidium that was native to Japan. Desiring to have one of these cymbidiums planted in her garden, she contacted a number of plant distributors, only to discover that this particular cymbidium had not yet been imported to the United States. She contacted a plant distributor, who she knew had ties to Japan, and asked if it would be possible to acquire one of these cymbidiums from Japan. After checking with local and Japanese authorities, the distributor determined that he could indeed acquire the plant for the woman. The parties then signed a contract that stated the distributor would acquire the cymbidium from a nursery in Japan, have it shipped to the United States and have it planted in the woman's garden for the price of $5,000. The distributor promised that the plant would be in place within six months, and the woman promised to pay $1,000 at the time of the execution of the contract and$4,000 when the cymbidium was planted in her garden. The woman then handed a check for $1,000 to the distributor. Two weeks later, agricultural officials discovered that a special type of beetle that attacked citrus plants had adapted to using cymbidiums for nesting purposes. The female beetle would lay eggs among the roots of the cymbidiums, and it would sometimes take up to one year for the eggs to hatch. Fearing for the safety of the citrus crops in the United States, the United States government adopted a ban on the importation of all cymbidiums grown in foreign countries. As a result, the distributor was not able to acquire the cymbidium for the woman. Which of the following best states the legal relationship at this point between the distributor the woman?\nAvailable options are the following:\nA: The distributor's performance was not excused because of impossibility, and the woman can recover damages.\nB: The distributor's performance was not excused because of the supervening illegality, and the woman can recover damages, provided she waits until the date performance was due before filing suit.\nC: Both parties are excused from performance because of the supervening illegality, and neither can recover from the other.\nD: The distributor's performance was excused because of impossibility, and the woman cannot seek restitution.\nE: The distributor's performance was excused because of the supervening illegality, but the woman can seek restitution.\nF: The distributor's performance was excused because of impossibility, but the woman can seek restitution.\nG: Both parties are excused from performance because of the impossibility, and neither can recover from the other.\nH: Both parties are not excused from performance because of the supervening illegality, and either can recover from the other.\nI: The distributor's performance was not excused because of the supervening illegality, and the woman can recover damages because of the distributor's prospective inability to perform.",

        "question": "Loretta Landlord owned a commercial building in a commercial strip surrounded by a residential community. One of her largest spaces was rented on a month-to-month basis at $500 per month by a dance troop which held performances in the facility. The director of the dance troop moved to New York for a starring role Off-Broadway. Unfortunately the troop was unable to find another dance director, so it folded and vacated the space. Sally Sleazy learned of the closure and decided the location would be perfect for a topless strip joint. Sally rented the space from Loretta under a two-year lease at $1,000 per month without disclosing her intended use of the space. One month after the strip joint opened, the County Commissioners passed a new law prohibiting topless strip joints in that neighborhood. Sally told Loretta the new law made it impossible to operate the business, so she was leaving.

        "question": "A uniformed United States Park Policeman pulled over a motorist for going through a red light. The man reacted gruffly, telling the officer that he had no authority to stop him. There was a brief scuffle, and the officer issued two more charges, for disorderly conduct and failure to obey an officer. Eventually, the defendant pled guilty to the red light citation and the other two charges were dismissed. He then filed a federal court action against the park policeman in which he asserted a Bivens civil rights claim for false arrest and malicious prosecution. The first legal theory was that the park officer lacked authority to stop the plaintiff on a New York street and arrest him for a state traffic violation. He claimed that the officer was outside of his federal park land jurisdiction. Will the court likely uphold the authority of the park police under these facts?\nAvailable options are the following:\nA: The U.S. Park Police officer was within his rights to make an arrest, but he had to immediately transfer the defendant to state police.\nB: The officer was within his authority to make the arrest, but only because the defendant acted in a disorderly manner and failed to obey an officer.\nC: Federal officers, including the U.S. Park Police, cannot make arrests for state law violations under any circumstances.\nD: The officer's authority to make an arrest depends on the specific agreement between the federal park system and the state of New York.\nE: The federal officer is allowed to arrest for homicide and serious felonies but cannot make traffic arrests within a state's geographical jurisdiction.\nF: The federal officer was way outside his scope of authority and he clearly cannot make an arrest outside of the confines of the federal park systems.\nG: All federal officers can make arrests for all criminal offenses within a state's geographical jurisdiction under the priority status of federal law and federal law officers.\nH: The U.S. Park Police have the authority to make a warrantless arrest for a state law violation because of statutory grants of authority from the various states.\nI: All U.S. Park Police officers have nationwide jurisdiction and can make arrests for any offenses, regardless of whether they occur on federal or state land.",
