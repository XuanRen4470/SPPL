[GENERAL GUIDELINES]
- A set of instances will be provided first, each followed by "[EXAMPLE 1]", "[EXAMPLE 2]", and "[EXAMPLE 3]".
- Each instance consists of an INPUT and OUTPUT.
- Generate a new instance after "[NEW INSTANCE]".
- The new instance should require different functionalities or algorithms than the examples.

[INPUT REQUIREMENTS]
- The INPUT should be STRICTLY RELATED to "<input_theme>".
- The INPUT should be MUCH HARDER than provided examples, adding complexity and depth.
- The INPUT should not request for adding comments or docstrings to the OUTPUT.
- The INPUT could include test cases and should not require to include test cases in the OUTPUT.

[OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS]
- The OUTPUT of the new instance should be a good reference answer to the INPUT.
- The OUTPUT should not contain any other explanation or welcoming messages and just be a code block.
- The code block should begin with "```python\n", "```java\n", "```cpp\n", "```c\n", "```javascript\n", "```csharp\n", or "```php\n", and end with "\n```"
- The code block should not contain any comments or docstrings.
- The OUTPUT should not include test cases or an explanation of the code.

[FORMAT REQUIREMENTS]
- DO NOT WRITE ANY GREETING MESSAGES; just write the INPUT and OUTPUT only.
- After writing the INPUT, write "\nOUTPUT: " to indicate that you're starting to write the OUTPUT.
- Write "\n[END]" after you are done.

[EXAMPLE 1]
INPUT: <input1>
OUTPUT: <output1>
[END]

[EXAMPLE 2]
INPUT: <input2>
OUTPUT: <output2>
[END]

[EXAMPLE 3]
INPUT: <input3>
OUTPUT: <output3>
[END]

[NEW INSTANCE]
