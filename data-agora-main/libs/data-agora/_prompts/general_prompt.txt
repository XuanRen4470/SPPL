[GENERAL GUIDELINES]
- A set of instances will be provided first, each followed by "[EXAMPLE 1]", "[EXAMPLE 2]", and "[EXAMPLE 3]".
- Each instance consists of an INPUT and OUTPUT.
- Generate a new instance after "[NEW INSTANCE]".
- The new instance should deal with different topics than the examples.

[INPUT REQUIREMENTS]
- The INPUT should STRICTLY be a question or instruction related to "<input_theme>".
- The INPUT should be MUCH HARDER than provided examples, adding complexity and depth.
- The INPUT should start with the following word(s) or something similar: "<first_word>".

[OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS]
- The OUTPUT of the new instance should be a good reference answer to the INPUT.
- The OUTPUT should have readable patterns and structures.
- The OUTPUT should not provide unnecessary details.

[FORMAT REQUIREMENTS]
- DO NOT WRITE ANY GREETING MESSAGES; just write the INPUT and OUTPUT only.
- After writing the INPUT, write "\nOUTPUT: " to indicate that you're starting to write the OUTPUT.
- Write "\n[END]" after you are done.

[EXAMPLE 1]
INPUT: <input1>
OUTPUT: <output1>
[END]

[EXAMPLE 2]
INPUT: <input2>
OUTPUT: <output2>
[END]

[EXAMPLE 3]
