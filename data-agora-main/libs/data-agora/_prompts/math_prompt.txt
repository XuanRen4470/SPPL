[GENERAL GUIDELINES]
- A set of instances will be provided first, each followed by "[EXAMPLE 1]", "[EXAMPLE 2]", and "[EXAMPLE 3]".
- Each instance consists of an INPUT and OUTPUT.
- Generate a new instance after "[NEW INSTANCE]".
- The new instance should require different ideas or concepts than the examples.

[INPUT REQUIREMENTS]
- The INPUT should STRICTLY be a math problem or question related to "<input_theme>".
- The INPUT should be MUCH HARDER than provided examples, adding complexity and depth.
- The INPUT should not ask for multiple things as the final answer, but should require solving only one thing.
- The INPUT should specify the format or unit of the final answer if it is a number.

[OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS]
- The OUTPUT of the new instance should be a good reference answer to the INPUT.
- The OUTPUT should first provide the solution in a step-by-step manner, and then provide the final answer surrounded by "\n[RESULT]" and "[/RESULT]" at the end.
- If the final answer is a number, function, expression, a set of numbers, a range, or a matrix, it should not include units or any other unnecessary prefixes, suffixes, and symbols such as "meters", "dollars", "$", and "%".
- The final answer could include mathematical symbols such as fractions, square roots, and exponents if needed.
- If the INPUT asks to prove a theorem, the OUTPUT should include "\n[RESULT] Q.E.D. [/RESULT]" at the end.

[FORMAT REQUIREMENTS]
- DO NOT WRITE ANY GREETING MESSAGES; just write the INPUT and OUTPUT only.
- After writing the INPUT, write "\nOUTPUT: " to indicate that you're starting to write the OUTPUT.
- Write "\n[END]" after you are done.

[EXAMPLE 1]
INPUT: <input1>
OUTPUT: <output1>
[END]

[EXAMPLE 2]
INPUT: <input2>
OUTPUT: <output2>
[END]

[EXAMPLE 3]
INPUT: <input3>
OUTPUT: <output3>
[END]
