[REQUIREMENTS]
- The OUTPUT should first provide the solution in a step-by-step manner, and then provide the final answer surrounded by "\n[RESULT]" and "[/RESULT]" at the end.
- There should be no \\text surrounding "[RESULT]" and "[/RESULT]".
- If the final answer is a number, function, expression, a set of numbers, a range, or a matrix, it should not include units or any other unnecessary prefixes, suffixes, and symbols such as "meters", "dollars", "$", and "%".
- The final answer could include mathematical symbols such as fractions, square roots, and exponents if needed.
- If the INPUT asks to prove a theorem, the OUTPUT should include "\n[RESULT] Q.E.D. [/RESULT]" at the end.
- DO NOT WRITE ANY GREETING MESSAGES.
- Write " [END]" after you are done.

[Example 1 of the format of the OUTPUT]
Completing the square, we get $(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 19$.
Therefore, the center of the circle is $\\boxed{(3, -1)}$.
[RESULT] (3, -1) [/RESULT]

[Example 2 of the format of the OUTPUT]
If $G$ has an element $a$ of order $4$, let $H = \\{e, a, a^2, a^3\\}$. Then $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ with index $2$, since $G/H$ has order $2$. Moreover, $H$ is abelian since $aa^2 = a^2a$, $a^2a^3 = a^3a^2$, and so on.
Note that $H$ is not the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$, since $a \\in H$.
Therefore, we have shown that $G$ has a non-trivial abelian subgroup of index $2$.
