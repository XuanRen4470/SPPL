If I understand the definition of complex curve correctly, then the complex curve needn't to be a Riemann surface in general, it may have finite number of points in which it fails to be a smooth manifold. With these points excluded it is a Riemann surface. Right? I know the definition of the normalization of a complex curve (A holomorphic map from a Riemann surface to this complex curve such that ...), but in one article the authors used in this definition meromorphic map instead of holomorphic one. What is the meromorphic map in this context? Does one call by a meromorphic map from a Riemann surface to $\\mathbb C^2$ a holomorphic map from this Riemann surface to $\\mathbb CP^2$?",
        "response": "no your understanding is a little bit off, while not being off. If we define a complex curve locally as the nullset of some analytic function with non-zero gradient by the implicit function theorem we will get that we can locally express one variable as analytic function of the other: $(z,w(z))$ on some open subset of the space. We can now define a complex atlas on our curve via the projection on the first variable, or saying that our curve is locally the graph on an analytic function and so it is a Riemann surface. To define a Riemann surface with boundary we use the same definition used for smooth manifolds: we ask for the atlas to contain homeomorphisms with the half-disk: $D_0^+=\\{z\\in\\mathbb{C}\\,:\\,|z|<1\\, ,\\, \\Im(z)\\geq 0\\}$.\nAt this point here you understand what you get. Note that we can define Riemann surfaces in many ways and in such ways we may have to be careful at some points as you mentioned, but there are many ways to eliminate such problems such as plugging holes.\nAnd here when we talk of meromorphic maps between Riemann Surfaces what we mean is the underlying map in the local coordinates to be meromorphic.

This covers the regions of higher latitudes, extending from about 60 degrees up to the poles in both the hemisphere. Due to this less abundance of trees, the logging activity is not carried out  in this particular region.\n\nFurther explanation:\n \nLogging is defined as the activity where the trees are cut down and processed and are transported to the site where they are extensively used in order to make materials such as furniture, manufacturing of paper and other products .\n\nThe tundra region is usually characterised by the presence of the permafrost layer , which is a permanently frozen layer present under the surface of the earth. They are made up of materials such as soil, sand, gravel that are accumulated together by ice.\n\nThis logging activity has a direct effect on the atmosphere. It is because the deforestation process causes a reduction in the number of trees, as a result of which the CO2 present in the atmosphere will increase the global temperature of the earth, thereby causing the greenhouse effect.  Increasing logging activity also leads to soil erosion and degradation of the soil quality.\n\nDue to the absence of the trees, the tundra region is not affected by the logging activity. \n\nLearn more:\n \n1.

Using $(a^2+b^2)(x^2+y^2)=(ax+by)^2+(ay-bx)^2$, we can see that the maximum of $ax+by$ is reached when $ay-bx=0$. \n\nThen there is the generalization (Brahmagupta identity).  Connection with Fibonacci numbers. Everything is connected to everything else! \n     In another direction, counting the solutions $n=ax^2+bxy+cx^2$, to quadratic forms with negative discriminant is often the starting place for a course on Algebraic Number Theory.  I believe Gauss was one of the first people to think about this area.  This leads to the definition of Class Number, and we can prove things like Dirichlet's Class Number Formula.\n\nSolutions to $x^2+y^2$ is one of the simplest examples to start with.\n     One of my favorite math videos of all time (3Blue1Brown \"Pi hiding in prime regularities\") https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaL_Cb42WyY studies the question of how many lattice points are on a certain circle in the plane (a problem about counting how many times a number is a sum of 2 squares), and transforms that into a factorization problem in $\\mathbb Z[i]$. Due to regularity of how primes factor in $\\mathbb Z[i]$, we ultimately get a formula for $\\pi$ in terms of the Dirichlet $L$-function for the non-primitive quadratic character $\\chi_4$ of conductor $4$.\nThis (and generalizations of this problem to other quadratic number rings $\\mathbb Z[r]$) connects arithmetic in $\\mathbb Z[r]$, lattice points on circles/ellipses, lattice regions approximating disks/ellipses, infinite sum formulas for $\\pi$, the Dirichlet class number formula, the non-vanishing of $L(1,\\chi)$ (the $L$-functions at $s=1$), which lead to things like Dirichlet's theorem of primes in arithmetic progressions, and the generalized Riemann hypothesis.\nThis material is explored in https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2014/11/23/254a-notes-1-elementary-multiplicative-number-theory/, https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2014/11/28/245a-supplement-1-a-little-bit-of-algebraic-number-theory-optional/.\n    ",
