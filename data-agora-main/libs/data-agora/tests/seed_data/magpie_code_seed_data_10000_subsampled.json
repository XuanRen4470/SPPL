Here are examples of both approaches:\n\n**String Interpolation**\n```swift\nlet noun = \"tree\"\nlet sentence = \"She found a branch of \\(noun) interesting\"\nprint(sentence) // Output: \"She found a branch of tree interesting\"\n```\nIn this example, we define a variable `noun` with the value \"tree\". We then use string interpolation to insert the value of `noun` into the sentence using the `\\()` syntax.\n\n**String Concatenation**\n```swift\nlet noun = \"tree\"\nlet sentence = \"She found a branch of \" + noun + \" interesting\"\nprint(sentence) // Output: \"She found a branch of tree interesting\"\n```\nIn this example, we use the `+` operator to concatenate the strings together.\n\nYou can also use a `String` method like `replacingOccurrences(of:with:)` to replace a specific substring with a new value:\n```swift\nlet originalSentence = \"She found a branch of something interesting\"\nlet noun = \"tree\"\nlet newSentence = originalSentence.replacingOccurrences(of: \"something\", with: noun)\nprint(newSentence) // Output: \"She found a branch of tree interesting\"\n```\nThis approach is useful if you have a fixed sentence with a placeholder value that you want to replace with a dynamic value.\n\nChoose the approach that best fits your use case!",

It's just a note to humans reading the code.\n* The `using System;` line imports the `System` namespace, which provides a lot of useful classes and methods, including the `Console` class.\n* The `class HelloWorld` line defines a new class called `HelloWorld`. In C#, every program must have at least one class.\n* The `static void Main(string[] args)` line defines the `Main` method, which is the entry point of the program. The `static` keyword means that this method can be called without creating an instance of the class. The `void` keyword means that this method doesn't return any value. The `string[] args` parameter is an array of strings that represents the command-line arguments passed to the program.\n* The `Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");` line uses the `Console.WriteLine` method to print the string \"Hello World!\" to the console, followed by a newline character.

The `digit_sum` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of its digits. This is done by converting the integer to a string, iterating over each character (digit) in the string, converting each character back to an integer, and summing them up.\n2. The main function uses a list comprehension to create a new list that meets the conditions. It iterates over the original list `numbers` and includes a number `n` in the new list if and only if:\n\t* The digit sum of `n` is greater than the given `threshold`.\n\t* `n` is divisible by the given `divisor` (i.e., `n % divisor == 0`).\n\nThe order of the original list is preserved because the list comprehension iterates over the original list in order.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```\nnumbers = [12, 34, 56, 78, 90, 111, 222, 333]\nthreshold = 10\ndivisor = 3\n\nresult = filter_list(numbers, threshold, divisor)\nprint(result)  # [111, 222, 333]\n```\nI hope this helps!

We use a `std::vector` to store the list of numbers entered by the user.\n2. We use a `while` loop to get the list of numbers from the user. The user can enter as many numbers as they want, and we store them in the `numbers` vector. We exit the loop when the user enters 0.\n3. We use a `for` loop to iterate through the `numbers` vector.\n4. Inside the loop, we check if the current number is non-positive (i.e., `num <= 0`). If it is, we throw a `std::runtime_error` exception with an error message.\n5. If the number is positive, we print the square of the number using `std::cout`.\n\nNote that we use a range-based `for` loop, which is a C++11 feature. If you're using an older version of C++, you can use a traditional `for` loop with an index variable instead.\n\nAlso, we use `std::runtime_error` to handle the error case.
