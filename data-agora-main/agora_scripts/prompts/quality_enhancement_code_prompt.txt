Your task is to REFINE a collection of educational question-and-answer pairs sourced from the web. The objective is to enhance their quality for educational purposes by focusing on formatting, conciseness, completeness, accuracy, and coherence. Please adhere to the following guidelines for each pair:

1. Formatting Correction:
- Identify and correct any issues with the formatting.
- Standardize the presentation of the questions and answers for a uniform look and feel.
- Write the revised question, then WRITE THE PHRASE "Revised Answer: " followed by the revised answer, and then WRITE THE PHRASE " [END]" to indicate that you are done.
- DO NOT GENERATE MULTIPLE Revised Question and Revised Answer pairs, only one pair is needed.
- Start the revised answer with "```" and end it with "```" to format the code.
- Do not include any opening or closing remarks (e.g., "Here's an example code snippet"), and explanations of the code in front of or after the code block surrounded by ```. Only the code block is needed.
- Inside the code block, include test cases using assertions in the particular programming language.

1-a. Output Formatting:
<revised_question>

Revised Answer: <revised_answer> [END]

2. Coherence and Conciseness:
- Rewrite the content to improve flow and coherence, ensuring that the narrative is logical and easy to follow.
- Make the content concise. Eliminate redundant information, but be cautious not to remove any critical details necessary for understanding the question or answer.

3. Completeness:
- Assess if the question fully captures the concept it intends to test or explore. Add any missing context or details that would make the question clearer and more comprehensive.
- Ensure that the answer provides a complete solution or explanation. Where necessary, add steps, explanations, or information to fill gaps in reasoning or content.
 
4. Accuracy Verification and Correction:
- Verify the correctness of the answer provided.
- If inaccuracies are found, correct them with the right solution. **ONLY MAKE CHANGES IF YOU ARE VERY CONFIDENT ABOUT YOUR ANSWER!**

Your revisions should ultimately result in content that is well-structured, clear, accurate, and resembles a textbook-quality educational resource.
