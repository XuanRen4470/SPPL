Considering the initial conditions: the red block is clear and on top of the blue block, the yellow block is clear and on top of the orange block, with the blue and orange blocks both on the table, the following sequence of actions will accomplish the task:\n\n1. First, the yellow block, which is on top of the orange block, needs to be moved. Since the yellow block is clear, you can unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block while your hand is empty.\n2. Once the yellow block is unstacked, put it down on the table to free your hand for further actions.\n3. With the orange block now being clear, pick it up from the table.\n4.

Begin by unstacking the red block from the yellow block, which frees up the red block and allows the yellow block to become a clear one on top of the orange block. Next, place the red block down on the table, ensuring that the hand is empty and ready for the next move. Then, unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block, setting the yellow block free and making it clear. After that, put down the yellow block onto the table. With the hand empty again, pick up the orange block to prepare it for stacking. Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block to partially achieve the goal configuration.

Initially, the red, blue, and orange blocks are all clear, meaning they don't have anything on top of them, and your hand is empty.\n\nYour objective is to reposition the blocks so that the red block is on top of the blue block, and subsequently, the orange block is on top of the red block. You should start by picking up the red block from the table since it is clear. Once you are holding the red block, you can stack it onto the clear blue block. After that, you need to unstack the orange block from the yellow block carefully as it is already clear due to the initial conditions. Finally, with the orange block in your hand, stack it onto the previously stacked red block to achieve the desired configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(stack orange red)",

Your goal is to move these blocks around so the red block ends up being on top of the yellow block.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. Start by unstacking the yellow block from on top of the orange block. Since the yellow block is clear, you can easily pick it up.\n2. Once you've unstacked the yellow block, put it down on the table so your hand is free for the next action.\n3. Now, unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block, which is directly below since it is a clear block. \n4. Place the orange block down on the table to free up your hands again.\n5. Next, unstack the blue block from on top of the red block, which is at the bottom of the stack and thus clear.\n6.

        "answer": "In the given task, we start with initial conditions involving several colored blocks and specific goals to achieve with restrictions on our actions. Our current setup consists of the red block being on top of the blue block, both of which rest on the table, and the orange and yellow blocks separately on the table. Our objective is to rearrange these blocks so that the red block ends up on top of the yellow block, which is on top of the orange block, itself positioned on the blue block.\n\nHere's the step-by-step sequence to achieve the goal, keeping in mind all restrictions:\n\n1. Begin by unstacking the red block from its position on top of the blue block. By doing this, we clear the red block from the blue one while ensuring our hand is empty beforehand.\n\n2. With the red block in hand, proceed to put it down on the table. This action frees up our hand and clears any obligations with the red block momentarily.\n\n3. Next, pick up the orange block from the table. Since the orange block is clear and our hand is now free, this action is permissible.\n\n4. With the orange block in our grasp, stack it on top of the blue block. This creates a stack where the orange block directly rests on the blue block.\n\n5. Having completed the previous stack, next, we'll pick up the yellow block. This action is possible since the yellow block is also clear, sitting alone on the table.\n\n6. Now, we stack the yellow block on top of the orange block. This forms a multi-layered stack, starting from the blue block at the bottom, followed by the orange block and then the yellow block on top.\n\n7. With this partial arrangement captured, we return to the red block. Pick it up from the table, where we left it earlier. At this point, our hand should be free again.\n\n8. Finally, complete our stack by placing the red block on top of the yellow block. With this action, we achieve our goal configuration where the red block is the topmost block on a tower comprised of, from bottom to top, the blue, orange, yellow, and red blocks, meeting all goal and restriction criteria.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red yellow)",

Start by unstacking the yellow block from the orange block. This action requires your hand to be empty and the yellow block to be clear.\n\n2. Once you have unstacked the yellow block, put it down on the table since your hand needs to be empty to pick up or unstack other blocks.\n\n3. Next, unstack the orange block from the red block. The orange block must be clear, and your hand must be empty to perform this action.\n\n4. After unstacking the orange block, stack it on top of the yellow block by holding the orange block and placing it onto the clear yellow block.\n\n5. Now, unstack the red block from the blue block.

The blue block is positioned separately on the table. The end goal is to rearrange the blocks so that the red block is ultimately on top of the yellow block.\n\nTo achieve this objective, you can follow a series of systematic actions, bearing in mind the constraints:\n\n1. Begin the process by unstacking the red block from its position on top of the orange block. This action frees up the red block for movement.\n\n2. Next, proceed to stack the red block on the blue block, leveraging the fact that the blue block is clear and provides temporary support for the red block.\n\n3. Following this, unstack the orange block from its current location on top of the yellow block, allowing you to deal with the underlying stack.\n\n4. Once unstacked, put down the orange block on the table, ensuring your hand is free for subsequent actions.\n\n5. Now, return to the red block, which is currently on top of the blue block.

        "answer": "In this task, your initial conditions involve a sequence of blocks that you need to rearrange into a specific order using a set of defined actions. Initially, the red block is clear, which suggests that no block is placed on top of it. The blue block is also clear and situated on the table, while the red block is stacked on the yellow block, and the yellow block is on top of the orange block, which is on the table.\n\nYour goal is to rearrange these blocks so that the blue block ends up on top of the yellow block, the orange block is positioned on top of the blue block, and the yellow block is placed on top of the red block.\n\nHere is the step-by-step approach outlined to achieve this:\n\n1. Begin by unstacking the red block from on top of the yellow block. This step is essential because it separates the red block from the stack, keeping the yellow block accessible for further manipulation.\n\n2. Next, put down the red block on the table to free up your hand for the next actions.\n\n3. Proceed by unstacking the yellow block from on top of the orange block. This action is necessary for repositioning the yellow block later in the process.\n\n4. Stack the yellow block on top of the red block, arranging these two blocks in the intended end configuration.\n\n5. Pick up the blue block from the table as the next step in the alignment process.\n\n6. Place the blue block on top of the yellow block, conforming further to the goal arrangement.\n\n7. Then, pick up the orange block from the table.\n\n8. Finally, stack the orange block on top of the blue block to complete your desired block configuration.\n\nThis sequence of actions will achieve your goal of having the blue block on top of the yellow block, the orange block on top of the blue block, and the yellow block on top of the red block according to the specified constraints and permitted actions.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)",

Unstack the red block from on top of the blue block; since the red block is the top block and the hand is now empty, this is possible.\n\n4. Put down the red block on the table to free up the hand again.\n\n5. Unstack the blue block from the orange block, as it is now the topmost block and the hand is empty.\n\n6. Stack the blue block on top of the red block, because after putting down the red block, it is clear.\n\n7. Pick up the orange block from the table; the orange block is clear and can be picked up because the hand is empty.\n\n8. Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block, because now that the yellow block was put down, it is clear.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack yellow red)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)",

        "answer": "To solve the block stacking problem, follow this sequence of actions adhering to the rules and initial conditions provided. Initially, your red and orange blocks are clear, with the hand empty. You can begin by unstacking the orange block from the blue one since the hand is empty and the orange is clear on top of blue. Next, put down the orange block on the table so the hand becomes free again. Proceed to unstack the red block from the yellow which is possible because the hand is empty and red is clear. Then, stack the red block onto the blue block which is currently on the table and also clear. With the hand empty once more, pick up the yellow block because it\u2019s clear and on the table after the unstacking. Now stack the yellow on top of the red block which is on top of blue. Finally, pick up the orange block again and stack it on the yellow block, achieving your goal configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(stack red blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of arranging the blocks such that the orange block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the red block, while starting with the given initial conditions, you can follow this sequence of actions:\n\n1. First, unstack the orange block that is currently on top of the red block. This will make the orange block clear and allow it to be manipulated further.\n2. Then, proceed to stack the orange block on top of the blue block. This temporarily places the orange block elsewhere, freeing up space for further manipulations of the remaining blocks. \n3. Next, unstack the red block that is currently on top of the yellow block. This action will clear the red block, allowing it to be moved.\n4. Place the red block down on the table, ensuring you have an empty hand again for subsequent actions.\n5. Pick up the yellow block from the table, making it ready for stacking in the correct order.\n6. Proceed to stack the yellow block on top of the red block. This order is part of the final goal configuration.\n7. Unstack the orange block from its temporary position on the blue block. This action frees the orange block for its final position.\n8. Finally, stack the orange block on top of the yellow block, completing the desired arrangement where the orange block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the red block.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange red)\n(stack orange blue)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(stack orange yellow)",
