You are holding the red block and the orange block is clear, so this action is valid. Once stacked, the red block is on top of the orange block, and the goal is achieved.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)"

The following steps outline the reasoning process:\n\n1. Initially, the orange block is on top of the blue block, which is on top of the red block. To gain access to the blue and red blocks, we must first remove the orange block. Thus, we unstack the orange block from the blue block. Since the orange block is clear and the hand is empty, this action is possible.\n\n2. After unstacking, the orange block is held in the hand. To proceed, we put down the orange block on the table, clearing the blue block.\n\n3. Now, the blue block is clear but is on top of the red block. We need the red block to eventually be on top of the blue block, so the next step is to unstack the blue block from the red block. This step is valid as the hand is empty, and the blue block is clear.\n\n4. After unstacking, we hold the blue block. We then put down the blue block on the table, making the red block visible and clear.\n\n5. At this point, the red block is on top of the yellow block on the table. We must move the red block so it can later be stacked on the blue block. So, we unstack the red block from the yellow block. This is possible because the hand is empty, and the red block is clear.\n\n6.

The first step is to remove the red block from on top of the orange block, making the orange block clear. This would imply:\n   - (unstack red orange)\n\n4. Though initially, it seems necessary to move red off orange and then, counterintuitively, stack it on blue, then unstack this step again since no further instruction makes it clear -- a misunderstanding from instructions because you start by ensuring red is only temporarily on blue. This does not directly help the final configuration but aligns with the transcription of steps witnessed. Thus:\n   - (stack red blue)\n\n5. However, seemingly unrelated to this goal, or redundancy misstep in transcript, ensure the orange and yellow blocks become clear. This points to:\n   - (unstack orange yellow)\n   - (put-down orange)\n\n6. The blue block is already clear, but for correctness pedal back:\n   - (unstack red blue)\n   - (stack red orange) to originally preserve given setup after the above.\n\n7. Finally, move the yellow block to achieve the ultimate goal which was yellow on top of blue:\n   - (pick-up yellow)\n   - (stack yellow blue)\n\nBy considering actions and blocks' clear status via hand availability and constraints, the steps pursued reflect the mismatched transcription reordering guided by all known viable moves respecting constraints.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red orange)  \n(stack red blue)  \n(unstack orange yellow)  \n(put-down orange)  \n(unstack red blue)  \n(stack red orange)  \n(pick-up yellow)  \n(stack yellow blue)"

Sixth action: Stack the red block on top of the blue block. The hand is now empty.\n\n8. Seventh action: Pick up the orange block so we can stack it on the yellow block.

The blue block is currently on top of the orange block and is clear, so we can unstack the blue block from the orange block.\n\n4. **Put Down Blue:** After unstacking the blue block, we need our hand free to handle the orange block, so we put down the blue block on the table.\n\n5. **Pick Up Orange:** With the blue block out of the way, the orange block is now clear and on the table, so we can pick up the orange block.\n\n6. **Stack Orange on Red:** Finally, we stack the orange block, which we are holding, on top of the red block, which is on the yellow block.

We need to move the blue block so that it is on top of the orange block. Currently, the blue block is not clear because the orange block is resting on it. Therefore, the first step should be to unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block, making the blue block clear.\n3. After unstacking the orange block, we need to put it down on the table to get an empty hand, allowing us to perform further actions.\n4. Once the orange block is put down, the blue block becomes clear, so we can unstack it from the red block.\n5. Now, as the blue block is being held, we stack it on top of the orange block according to the goal state.\n\nPlan:\n- Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block.\n- Put down the orange block on the table.\n- Unstack the blue block from on top of the red block.\n- Stack the blue block on top of the orange block.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack blue red)\n(stack blue orange)"

Now, to achieve the goal configuration:\n   - Pick up the yellow block, which is clear and unstacked, and stack it on top of the red block (on the table).\n   - The yellow block stacking on red makes the yellow on top of the red.\n   - Pick up the orange block, which was on the table and is clear, and stack it on top of the yellow block.\n   - The orange block stacking on yellow makes the orange on top of the yellow.\n   - Finally, pick up the blue block and stack it on top of the orange block to achieve the complete goal configuration.\n\nTherefore, the actions are sequenced as follows:\n\nINFERENCE: The first step is unstacking the red from the orange, and putting down the red block on the table; this clears space for the correct arrangement.

The yellow block is on top of the red block, meaning the yellow block is not directly on the table but rather on the red block, which is on the table. \n\n3. To proceed with the plan, we must make intermediary blocks clear and usable:\n   - Orange block: Clear, on the table.\n   - Blue block: Clear, on the table.\n   - Yellow block: Clear but on the red block.\n\n4. The goal is to have:\n   - The red block on top of the orange block.\n   - The blue block on top of the red block.\n   - The orange block on top of the yellow block.\n\nPLAN DETAILS:\n\n- **Unstack:** Unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block. This action makes the red block clear and the yellow block can be put down on the table.\n\n- **Put Down:** Put down the yellow block on the table.\n\n- **Pick Up:** Pick up the orange block from the table which is already clear and available to use.\n\n- **Stack:** Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block. Now, the orange block is no longer clear, but the orange block is on top of the yellow block.\n\n- **Pick Up:** Pick up the red block, which was cleared in the first step when the yellow block was unstacked.\n\n- **Stack:** Stack the red block on top of the orange block. This step makes the red block no longer clear, but it is positioned correctly on the orange block.\n\n- **Pick Up:** Pick up the blue block, which is clear on the table.\n\n- **Stack:** Stack the blue block on top of the red block.\n\nFinal conditions must match the goal state where the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on top of the red block, and the orange block is on top of the yellow block.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack yellow red)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue red)"

Start with the initial condition where \"red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.\"\n\n2. The first goal is to place the red block on top of the orange block. Since the red block is on top of the yellow block, we need to unstack it first:\n   - Unstack the red block from the yellow block, making the hand non-empty and the yellow block clear.\n\n3. Put down the red block on the table to empty the hand.\n\n4. Now, the blue block needs to be on top of the yellow block. Since the blue block is on top of the orange block, unstack the blue block:\n   - Unstack the blue block from the orange block, making the hand non-empty and the orange block clear.\n\n5. Stack the blue block onto the yellow block, emptying the hand and putting the blue block in the desired position.\n\n6. Pick up the orange block since we need to move the red block onto it. \n\n7. Stack the orange block on top of the blue block, completing the goal for the orange block and positioning it correctly.\n\n8. Now the final step, pick up the red block.\n\n9. Stack the red block onto the orange block, achieving the final desired configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)"

Put down the orange block onto the table: (put-down orange)\n6. The yellow block is now clear and must be picked up and stacked onto the orange block:\n    - Pick up the yellow block: (pick-up yellow)\n7.
