        "answer": "**[Insert Question]: How can I rearrange the blocks to meet my goal of having the red block on top of the yellow block and the yellow block on top of the blue block?**\n\nTo achieve your goal, follow these steps based on the current arrangement of the blocks as described in the gold label. Start with the yellow block being clear and your hand being empty. The red block is currently on top of the orange block, the orange block is above the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, and the blue block is on the table. \n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block.** This action clears the yellow block so you can manipulate it freely.\n\n2. **Put down the yellow block.** Now the yellow block is on the table, making it clear and allowing you to stack it again later.\n\n3. **Unstack the red block from on top of the orange block.** This gets the red block into your hands and clears the way for moving other blocks.\n\n4. **Put down the red block.** It can now sit on the table, waiting to be stacked again.\n\n5. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block.** This action releases the orange block, allowing you to move it.\n\n6. **Put down the orange block.** Now the orange block is on the table and clear.\n\n7. **Pick up the yellow block.** You can now hold the yellow block that was resting on the table.\n\n8. **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.** This places the yellow block in the desired position.\n\n9. **Pick up the red block.** Now that the yellow block is in place, you can grab the red block from the table.\n\n10. **Stack the red block on top of the yellow block.** This completes your arrangement, placing the red block on top of the yellow block.\n\nFollowing these steps will allow you to achieve your goal of having the red block on top of the yellow block and the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n\n**Final Answer: (unstack yellow red) (put-down yellow) (unstack red orange) (put-down red) (unstack orange blue) (put-down orange) (pick-up yellow) (stack yellow blue) (pick-up red) (stack red yellow)**",

        "answer": "To achieve the desired arrangement of blocks where the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is on top of the orange block, we need to follow a well-structured plan that adheres to the restrictions and initial conditions provided. \n\nLet's break down the approach step by step:\n\n1. **Unstack the blue block from the orange block**: Since the blue block is currently clear (not blocked by any other block), we start by removing it from the orange block. This requires us to ensure that our hand is empty before performing this action.\n\n2. **Stack the blue block on top of the red block**: After successfully unstacking, we can now place the blue block on the red block. However, it's crucial to ensure that the red block is also clear (as it is not stated, we assume the red block is clear), so this action should follow the first action.\n\n3. **Pick up the yellow block**: With the blue block now stacked on the red block, we need to pick up the yellow block from the table, ensuring our hand is still empty.\n\n4. **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block**: Now that we have the yellow block in our hand, we can stack it on the orange block since it's on the table and clear at this point.\n\n5. **Unstack the blue block from the red block**: We will then unstack the blue block back from the red block (this will reset the positions of the blocks).\n\n6. **Stack the blue block on the yellow block**: Next, we will place the blue block on top of the yellow block, which is now positioned above the orange block.\n\n7. **Pick up the red block**: With the blue and yellow blocks now positioned correctly, we will pick up the red block.\n\n8. **Stack the red block on top of the blue block**: Lastly, we will stack the red block on the blue block to complete the stacking order according to the goals provided.\n\nEach step is designed to adhere to the restrictions of only unstacking and stacking when permissible and ensuring that each action clears the block if required.\n\nWith this plan outlined, we follow through as directed, ensuring that we respect all rules while achieving the desired configuration of blocks.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue orange) (stack blue red) (pick-up yellow) (stack yellow orange) (unstack blue red) (stack blue yellow) (pick-up red) (stack red blue)",

        "answer": "To successfully achieve the goal of stacking the blocks as specified, it's important to follow the restrictions and initial conditions meticulously. The process involves systematically arranging the blocks while adhering to the rules regarding which blocks can be picked up, unstacked, or stacked based on their current condition (clear or not) and the state of your hands (empty or holding a block). Here\u2019s a breakdown of how to interpret the initial conditions and why the gold label response is structured that way.\n\n1. **Understanding the Initial Conditions**:\n   - The blue block is clear, meaning it can be freely manipulated.\n   - The orange block is on top of the yellow block, making the yellow block obstructed and not clear.\n   - The yellow block is on top of the red block, implying the red block is also obstructed.\n   - The red block is on the table, and you can manipulate it but only after clearing the blocks above it.\n   - The hand is empty, indicating that you can start picking up blocks.\n\n2. **Reaching the Goal**:\n   - Your goal is to arrange the blocks so that the red block sits on top of the orange block, the blue block sits on top of the red block, and the yellow block sits on top of the blue block.\n   - To achieve this, it's necessary to first unstack the blocks that are currently on top of others to clear them.\n\n3. **Executing the Plan**:\n   - **Unstack the Orange Block from the Yellow Block (unstack orange yellow)**: First, you need to remove the orange block to reveal the yellow block beneath it.\n   - **Put Down the Orange Block (put-down orange)**: After unstacking the orange block, you simply place it down so you have both blocks separated.\n   - **Unstack the Yellow Block from the Red Block (unstack yellow red)**: Now that the orange block is out of the way, you can unstack the yellow block from the red block.\n   - **Put Down the Yellow Block (put-down yellow)**: After removing the yellow block, place it back down, leaving the red block accessible.\n   - **Pick Up the Red Block (pick-up red)**: With the yellow block now on the table and the red block clear, you can pick up the red block.\n   - **Stack the Red Block on the Orange Block (stack red orange)**: Next, stack the red block on top of the orange block as intended.\n   - **Pick Up the Blue Block (pick-up blue)**: Once the red block is correctly positioned, you can now pick up the blue block which is still clear and available to manipulate.\n   - **Stack the Blue Block on the Red Block (stack blue red)**: Stack the blue block on top of the red block to move closer to your goal.\n   - **Pick Up the Yellow Block (pick-up yellow)**: Finally, after successfully stacking the blue block, pick up the yellow block which is free at this point.\n   - **Stack the Yellow Block on the Blue Block (stack yellow blue)**: Complete the arrangement by stacking the yellow block on top of the blue block as per your original goal.\n\nEach step of the process is carefully thought out to ensure that all movements comply with the stated restrictions and conditions. This methodical approach aids in successfully organizing the blocks into the desired configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange yellow) (put-down orange) (unstack yellow red) (put-down yellow) (pick-up red) (stack red orange) (pick-up blue) (stack blue red) (pick-up yellow) (stack yellow blue)",
