This is substantiated by the use of the `ToolSearcher(keywords='reminder')` which identified the `AppointmentReminder` API.\n\nStep 3: Utilize the `AppointmentReminder` API.\n- This API allows setting reminders for appointments. It takes `appointment_time` as an input parameter, which is already provided as `2034-01-05 14:30:00`.\n\nStep 4: Determine the `reminder_time`.\n- Logical reasoning for setting a reminder might include providing a notice shortly before the appointment time to prepare. A common practice would set this reminder for 30 minutes before the appointment time or based on typical preparation time, e.g., `2034-01-05 14:00:00`.\n\nStep 5: Construct the API request.\n- Using the `AppointmentReminder` API with `appointment_time='2034-01-05 14:30:00'` and `reminder_time='2034-01-05 14:00:00'`.\n\nFinal Answer: API-Request: [AppointmentReminder(appointment_time='2034-01-05 14:30:00', reminder_time='2034-01-05 14:00:00')]",

        "answer": "Step by Step INFERENCE HERE:\n\n1. **User's Utterance Analysis:** The user wants to track the progress of a patient in a Physical Therapy program. The user's request is to generate an API request to record measurements based on tracked parameters in this context.\n\n2. **Previous API Responses Review:**\n   - The initial API request was made using `ToolSearcher` with the keywords '`physical therapy progress parameters`'.\n   - This led to the discovery of an API named `ProgressParamsTracker` that can retrieve the parameters necessary for tracking the progress of a patient.\n   - The `ProgressParamsTracker` API was then used, which returned the parameters: 'Range of Motion (ROM)', 'Strength', 'Flexibility', and 'Balance'.\n\n3. **ToolSearcher for Recording Measurements:**\n   - Another `ToolSearcher` request was made with the keywords '`record measurements for parameters`', which provided details of an API named `MeasurementRecorder`. \n   - This API allows for recording measurements based on specified parameters, a patient ID for tracking progress, and a date for recording.\n\n4. **Identification of Necessary Information:**\n   - Parameters: ['Range of Motion (ROM)', 'Strength', 'Flexibility', 'Balance'] have already been identified.\n   - Patient ID: The problem statement indicates intending to record for a specific patient. Assume a placeholder ID `'123456'` as we need a specific ID but isn't provided in prior information.\n   - Date: The current time is given as `2034-01-01`, hence it can be used as the measurement date.\n\n5. **Final API Request Formation:**\n   - Compile the gathered details in the format the MeasurementRecorder API requires: parameters, patient_id, and date.\n\nFinal Answer: API-Request: [MeasurementRecorder(parameters=['Range of Motion (ROM)', 'Strength', 'Flexibility', 'Balance'], patient_id='123456', date='2034-01-01')]",
