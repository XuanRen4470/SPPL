Providing opioids alone is not clearly morally wrong, as they may be necessary for pain management. The context, such as prescription and necessity, would determine its moral standing. Without more context suggesting misuse or deception, this action isn't clearly morally wrong per se.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character knowingly brings a forbidden item, a knife, onto a plane by keeping it in their pocket. This act bypasses security regulations and puts others in potential danger, thereby violating the moral and legal standards regarding safety in air travel.
