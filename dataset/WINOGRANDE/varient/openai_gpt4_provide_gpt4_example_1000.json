Here, the implication is that something gets heated, and the action must occur prior to that happening.\n\n3. Typically, when dealing with metals and tools, the metal (iron) is heated in processes like forging, not the tool (sledgehammer).\n\n4. Therefore, it makes logical sense that the iron is what gets heated, and the action of hitting should occur before the iron is heated.\n\nFinal Answer: 1",

Generally, in a context involving heating and metals, \"iron\" refers to the object being worked on, with a sledgehammer typically used to shape or modify it.\n4. The \"sledgehammer\" is a tool used to apply force and is unlikely to be the subject that 'gets heated' during such processes.\n5. \"Iron\" is the subject that is likely to change temperature (get heated) when exposed to heat or the force of striking.\n\nFinal Answer: 1",

The sentence logically refers to an object being too large, preventing the dress from being hung. Dresses can vary in size, and it is plausible that a dress can be too large to fit into a closet properly.\n4. In contrast, the closet being too large does not make sense in this context as it's the space where clothes are placed; a larger closet would typically be an advantage, not an impediment.\n\nFinal Answer: 2",

The blank in \"was horrified\" refers to the person who reacted with horror upon hearing the information.\n3. Since Sarah is the one who confided, she is likely already aware of her actions and the consequences associated with them. It is not typical for a person to be horrified by their own actions at the point of confession, especially if they felt safe enough to confide in someone.\n4. On the other hand, Laura, as the listener and recipient of the information, is more likely to be shocked or horrified by the revelation. It would be a natural reaction upon hearing such unexpected news about a close friend.\n\nFinal Answer: 2",
