Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: Option 1: Latin (is newer in terms of history, not in current usage)\n\nExplanation: Although German is a more widely spoken language today than Latin, Latin is actually older. Latin was the language of the Roman Empire and the foundation of the Romance languages, including Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Romanian. German, on the other hand, is a Germanic language that evolved from Old High German around the 8th century AD. Therefore, Latin is indeed the \"newer\" language in the sense that it came before German in historical terms. However, it's important to note that when people talk about \"newer\" languages today, they usually mean languages that are more recently developed or more widely spoken. In this context, German would be the \"newer\" language in that sense, but that's not what the question is asking."

On the other hand, having two ears is the normal, symmetrical condition for humans. However, the question states that \"this meant that\" something was very symmetrical. This implies that the asymmetrical condition (Steven having one ear) is being compared to or contrasted with a symmetrical condition.

Therefore, the blank should refer to something related to the book.\n\nFinal Answer: 2. The blank in the sentence is most likely filled by the word \"book.\" The sentence indicates that something was not finished, and given that the action is borrowing from the library, it makes sense that the book itself was not finished, hence the need to return it.

Therefore, the blank should refer to something related to the book.\n\nFinal Answer: 2. The blank in the sentence is most likely filled by a word related to the book, such as \"reading\" or \"novel.\" However, since the context does not provide enough information to determine the exact word, the blank is most likely filled by the word \"book.\" Therefore, the correct answer is 2.\n\nExplanation: While it is possible that the blank could be filled by a word like \"reading,\" the context does not provide enough information to make that assumption with certainty. The sentence only mentions that the book was not finished, and it does not specify what kind of reading or which book is being referred to. Therefore, the safest assumption is that the blank is filled by the word \"book,\" which is the object of the action described in the sentence."
