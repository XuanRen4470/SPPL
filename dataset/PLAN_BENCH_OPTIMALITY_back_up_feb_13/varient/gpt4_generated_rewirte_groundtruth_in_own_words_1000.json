Currently, the red block is on top of the blue block and the yellow block is on top of the orange block. Both the blue and the orange blocks are on the table, and the hand is empty.\n\nTo achieve the goal, first unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block, since the orange block needs to be clear for further manipulation. This action will take one minute. Next, put down the yellow block so that your hand is free to pick up other blocks, which takes an additional minute.\n\nWith the hand now free and the orange block clear, pick up the orange block from the table. This will take one minute. Finally, stack the orange block on top of the red block to achieve the desired configuration. This final action will also take one minute.\n\nThus, this plan is completed in 4 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the blue block on top of the orange block and the orange block on top of the yellow block, given the initial conditions where the red block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, and both the blue and orange blocks are on the table, we need to carefully rearrange the blocks while following the rules and minimizing the time taken.\n\nInitially, the red block is on top of the yellow block, so we need to start by unstacking the red block from the yellow block to make the yellow block clear. Once we have unstacked the red block, we will put it down since our hand needs to be empty to continue with the next action. \n\nWith the red block set aside, we will then unstack the yellow block from the orange block. After unstacking, we will put down the yellow block to free our hand once again for the subsequent steps. Now that the yellow block is on the table, we proceed to pick up the orange block. With the orange block in hand, we can stack it on top of the yellow block, creating one part of our desired arrangement.\n\nFinally, with the orange block stacked on the yellow block and the hand empty, we will pick up the blue block.

        "answer": "The task requires rearranging a stack of blocks according to given conditions and actions. The initial setup consists of four blocks: a red block on the orange block, the orange block on the yellow block, the yellow block on the blue block, and the blue block resting on the table. Our goal is to end with the red block positioned on top of the blue block, and the blue block positioned directly atop the yellow block, completing the specified reorganization with minimal time spent.\n\nThe following actions will achieve this:\n\n1. Start by unstacking the red block from the orange block. This action takes 1 minute.\n2. Put down the red block onto the table. This clears the way to access other blocks and also takes 1 minute.\n3. Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block. Similarly, this takes 1 minute.\n4. Put down the orange block. This creates a clear path to reach the yellow block and takes 1 minute.\n5. Unstack the yellow block from atop the blue block, freeing the blue block. This step also takes 1 minute.\n6. Put down the yellow block. Placing it on the table prepares it for the final stacking order and takes 1 minute.\n7. Pick up the blue block from where it rests. We will reposition it to complete the block arrangement. This action requires 1 minute.\n8. Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block. This important move starts forming the desired stack and takes 1 minute.\n9. Finally, pick up the red block from where it was set down. This prepares the block for its final positioning, requiring 1 minute.\n10. Stack the red block on the blue block. This completes the task setup, requiring another 1 minute.\n\nIn summary, by meticulously unstacking and relocating each block, we align the stacks correctly in just 10 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack red orange)  \n(put-down red)  \n(unstack orange yellow)  \n(put-down orange)  \n(unstack yellow blue)  \n(put-down yellow)  \n(pick-up blue)  \n(stack blue yellow)  \n(pick-up red)  \n(stack red blue)",

Since the red block is under the blue block, next step is to unstack the red block from the yellow block.\n4. Put down the red block on the table.\n5. Unstack the blue block from the orange block, because orange should be on top of the red block.\n6. Place the blue block onto the yellow block.\n7. Pick up the orange block from the table.\n8. Finally, stack the orange block onto the red block.\n\nBy following these steps, the time is minimized while achieving the goal configuration. \n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack blue red)\n(stack blue orange)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)",

        "answer": "Initially, we can observe the following conditions: the red block is clear, the hand is empty, and the blue block sits atop the yellow block, while the yellow block is on the orange block. Our main goal is to have the orange block positioned on top of the red block and the yellow block positioned on top of the orange block.\n\nTo achieve this, we must first work on creating space and rearranging the blocks. Given the sequence of operations to transform the initial condition to the desired goal, we proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. **Unstack the blue block from the yellow block**: This action will make the yellow block clear for further manipulation. \n\n2. **Put down the blue block**: Remove it from the hand to free up space, making it available for stacking actions and allowing us to handle another block.\n\n3. **Unstack the yellow block from the orange block**: This creates the necessary configuration to separate the yellow block and allow us to handle the orange block next.\n\n4. **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block**: This places the yellow block safely out of immediate working space and enables us to clear the path for manipulating the orange block.\n\n5. **Pick up the orange block**: With the hands now free, this action lets us move the orange block into its target position.\n\n6. **Stack the orange block on the red block**: With this step, the part of our goal involving the orange block being on top of the red block is achieved.\n\n7. **Unstack the yellow block from the blue block**: Move the yellow block off the blue block in preparation for the final rearrangement.\n\n8. **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block**: This final move ensures the yellow block is correctly stacked atop the orange block, meeting all the goal conditions.\n\nFollowing these carefully arranged steps leads to the fulfillment of the given task with minimum time expenditure.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(stack yellow orange)",

The yellow block, which is currently situated on top of the orange block, needs to be unstacked carefully. Once unstacked, the yellow block must be set down on the table so the orange block becomes accessible. Following this, the orange block, which is resting on top of the red block, will be unstacked and placed on the table. Now, with the red block clear, it can be lifted and stacked securely on the clear blue block. Next, the yellow block, which was previously set down, is picked up and stacked on top of the red block.

Initially, the yellow block is on top of the stack, making it the first clear block that needs to be unstacked and placed aside to clear the blue block underneath. We start by unstacking the yellow block from the blue block and put it down on the table. Next, we focus on the blue block, which is now clear, and unstack it from the red block. At this point, we temporarily stack the blue block on top of the yellow block to manage space.\n\nFollowing this, we move to the red block by unstacking it from the orange block, and put it down.

The goal is to rearrange the blocks, so the yellow block is on top of the red block. Here's how the task unfolds:\n\n1. **Unstack the Yellow Block from on top of the Orange Block:** First, the yellow block needs to be separated from the block below it to make subsequent steps possible. This action makes the yellow block independent and unheld.\n\n2. **Put Down the Yellow Block:** After unstacking it, you place the yellow block temporarily on the table to free your hands for more actions.\n\n3. **Unstack the Orange Block from on top of the Red Block:** Next, remove the orange block from the red block, since it needs to be clear to later place the yellow block on red.\n\n4. **Put Down the Orange Block:** Similar to the yellow block, set the orange block down once it\u2019s separated to keep it aside.\n\n5. **Pick Up the Yellow Block:** With the red block clear, you need to have the yellow block in hand to stack it accurately.\n\n6. **Stack the Yellow Block on top of the Red Block:** To achieve the goal, finally position the yellow block on top of the red block.\n\nFollowing these steps ensures the blocks are arranged with minimal time taken for each action, optimizing the task within the given constraints.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack orange red)\n(put-down orange)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)",

First, unstack the blue block from the top of the red block, freeing the red block and allowing the blue block to be held.\n2. Next, stack the blue block onto the yellow block. This ensures an important part of the arrangement is complete, with the blue block now on the yellow block.\n3.

        "answer": "Given the initial conditions and goals outlined, I need to rearrange the blocks by following a series of actions while minimizing the time taken. Here is a detailed step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Unstack the Blue Block from the Red Block**: The blue block is currently on top of the red block, and my goal requires the red block to be on top of the blue block. Therefore, the first action is to unstack the blue block from the red block. This will take 1 minute.\n\n2. **Put Down the Blue Block**: After unstacking the blue block, I will need to put it down on the table, as my hand needs to be empty to manipulate the red block. This action takes another minute.\n\n3. **Pick Up the Red Block**: With the blue block now on the table and my hand free, I can pick up the red block to position it as required. This action costs another minute.\n\n4. **Stack the Red Block on the Blue Block**: With the red block in hand, I can now stack it on top of the blue block as per the goal. This move also consumes 1 minute.\n\n5. **Unstack the Orange Block from the Yellow Block**: The orange block needs to be placed on top of the red block, so I must first unstack it from the yellow block. This will take another 1 minute.\n\n6. **Stack the Orange Block on the Red Block**: Finally, I will stack the orange block on top of the red block to achieve the desired configuration. This will require an additional 1 minute.\n\nFollowing these steps, I will have arranged the blocks to meet the goal while minimizing time. The plan executed uses 6 actions, each taking 1 minute, totaling 6 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(stack orange red)",

        "answer": "To accomplish the desired stacking of blocks while adhering to the given rules and minimizing the time, the process is as follows:\n\n1. Start by unstacking the orange block, which is currently on top of the red block. This frees the orange block for further repositioning.\n\n2. Once the orange block is unstacked, put it down on the table to make your hand empty for the next operation.\n\n3. Now, unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block. This makes the red block available for the first stack in the final desired configuration.\n\n4. With the red block in your hand, put it down temporarily to free your hand for subsequent actions.\n\n5. Proceed to unstack the yellow block, which is on top of the blue block. This action prepares the yellow block for its final placement.\n\n6. Put the yellow block down on the table to keep your hand empty.\n\n7.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of stacking the blocks in the desired configuration, we start by recognizing the initial conditions where the red block and orange block are both clear, the hand is empty, and the current stacks have the red block on the blue block and the orange block on the yellow block. Our objective is to rearrange these blocks so that the blue block ends up on top of the yellow block, with the orange block on top of the red block, and the yellow block on top of the orange block. Here's how we proceed:\n\n1. **Unstack the red block from the blue block:** This step clears the blue block, making it accessible for future stacking.\n2. **Put down the red block:** We place the red block back on the table to free up our hand.\n3. **Unstack the orange block from the yellow block:** This action prepares the orange block to be relocated.\n4. **Stack the orange block on top of the red block:** The red block, now on the table and clear, can have the orange block stacked on top of it, aligning the new structure with part of our goal.\n5. **Pick up the yellow block:** Now that it's clear, we lift the yellow block to allow for its repositioning in the desired configuration.\n6. **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block:** This action begins forming the new stack structure required by the goal.\n7. **Pick up the blue block:** Finally, the now-clear blue block is picked up for the last step in the rearrangement.\n8. **Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block:** Completing the sequence, the blue block is stacked on the yellow, concluding the process and achieving the final goal.\n\nBy following this plan, each step is executed efficiently to achieve the goal configuration in the minimum time.

The task involves manipulating the blocks to reach the desired outcome in the shortest time possible. \n\n1. First, unstack the red block from the blue block. This step leaves the blue block clear and takes 1 minute.\n2. Next, put down the red block on the table. This makes your hand empty, preparing you for the next move, and takes another minute.\n3. Unstack the blue block from the orange block, making the blue block free to be moved. This step takes 1 minute.\n4. Stack the blue block on top of the red block. This step starts forming the desired configuration and takes 1 minute.\n5. Pick up the yellow block from the table. This block will be moved next, taking another minute.\n6. Finally, stack the yellow block on top of the blue block. This completes the arrangement in 1 minute.\n\nThe total time taken for these actions, considering each action takes 1 minute, is 6 minutes.

With the red block now placed down, pick up the blue block and stack it on top of the orange block. The blue block now held by the hand is being strategically moved to part of the goal arrangement.

This allows the blue block to become clear and ensures that the orange block can be repositioned without obstructing the blue block movement.\n\n2. **Put down the orange block**: Place the orange block onto the table, freeing up your hand and making the orange block available for later use.\n\n3. **Pick up the blue block**: With the blue block now clear, you can pick it up. This is a necessary step to move the blue block to its new position.\n\n4. **Stack the blue block on top of the red block**: Position the blue block on the red block as part of the goal configuration. Once this is done, leave your hand free for the next moves.\n\n5. **Pick up the yellow block**: Next, grab the yellow block from the table, preparing to position it in its new location.\n\n6. **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block**: Place the yellow block onto the blue block, setting up the next part of your configuration. Now, your hand is free to continue arranging the final pieces.\n\n7. **Pick up the orange block**: With your hand free, pick up the orange block again from the table.\n\n8. **Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block**: Finally, position the orange block on top of the yellow block to complete the desired arrangement.\n\nFollowing this plan of actions will minimize the time to achieve the goal, as each step uses the actions efficiently to reach the target configuration. \n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)",

        "answer": "To achieve the desired arrangement of blocks with the given initial conditions, the following sequence of actions should be performed:\n\n1. Begin by unstacking the yellow block from on top of the red block. Since the yellow block is currently on top of the red block, this action is possible and will take 1 minute.\n2. After unstacking the yellow block, put it down on the table. This action will take an additional minute and will free up your hand.\n3. Next, the red block should be unstacked from on top of the blue block. This action is possible because the red block is clear once the yellow block is put down, and it will take 1 minute.\n4. Place the red block on the table, taking 1 more minute to do so.\n5. Pick up the orange block, which is currently clear on the table. This action requires 1 minute.\n6. Stack the orange block on the red block, which is now clear and on the table. This action will take an additional minute.\n7. After that, pick up the blue block from the table. It is clear and therefore can be picked up, taking 1 more minute.\n8. Stack the blue block on the orange block. This stack is valid since the orange block is now clear at the top, and this action takes 1 minute.\n9. Lastly, pick up the yellow block from the table. It is clear after being put down initially, and this action takes 1 minute.\n10. Finally, stack the yellow block on the blue block. The blue block is clear, allowing the yellow block to be stacked on top, taking the final minute.\n\nEach action takes precisely 1 minute, resulting in the complete sequence being executed efficiently, achieving the goal condition where the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the red block, and the yellow block is on top of the blue block.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack yellow red)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)",

        "answer": "In this block-stacking problem, the initial state has the yellow block on top of the orange block, which is on top of the blue block, and the blue block is on top of the red block. The red block sits directly on the table, and the hand is empty. The goal is to rearrange the blocks such that the red block is on top of the orange block and the orange block is on top of the yellow block. This arrangement must be achieved in the least amount of time possible.\n\nTo achieve this goal efficiently, here's how the actions will be undertaken:\n\nFirst, unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block, making it possible to set it down. By doing this, the orange block becomes clear and ready for subsequent moves.\n\nOnce the yellow block is removed, place it down on the table, which will leave the hand empty and allow for further actions on the now-clear orange block.\n\nNext, unstack the orange block from the blue block. This action makes the blue block clear while maintaining the orange block held in hand.\n\nStack the orange block on top of the yellow block that was previously placed on the table. This step helps in partially achieving the intended stacking goal by reusing the now-clear yellow block.\n\nFollowing that, unstack the blue block from on top of the red block, freeing the red block for further manipulation.\n\nAfter unstacking, place the blue block down on the table, ensuring it won\u2019t interfere with subsequent actions involving the red block.\n\nWith a clear red block, pick it up so that it can be moved to complete the desired stacking arrangement onto the clear orange block.\n\nFinally, stack the red block on top of the orange block.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal with the given initial conditions, we start with all blocks clear and the hand empty. We want to rearrange them to match the desired configuration while minimizing the time.\n\nFirstly, we need to address the position of the red block. Since the red block is clear and on the table, we can easily pick it up. Then, we place the red block on top of the blue block, ensuring that both the red and blue blocks are properly stacked and aligned with our end goal, where the red block needs to be on top of the blue block.\n\nNext, we move on to the orange and yellow blocks. Since the orange block is on top of the yellow block, we need to unstack the orange block from the yellow block. This allows us to manipulate the blocks further. After unstacking, we put the orange block down on the table to ensure it does not interfere as we work with the yellow block.\n\nWith the orange block out of the way, we can pick up the yellow block. Then, we stack the yellow block on top of the red block, aligning with the requirement that the yellow block needs to be on top of the red block.\n\nFinally, we turn our attention back to the orange block.

Initially, the red, blue, and orange blocks are clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, and the red, orange, and yellow blocks are on the table. The goal is to have the yellow block on top of the orange block, and it should be achieved in the least amount of time. Here's the step-by-step strategy:\n\n1. Unstack the blue block from the yellow block. Since both the blue and yellow blocks are initially clear, you can unstack them, which takes 1 minute.\n2. Put down the blue block onto the table. This action takes 1 minute.\n3. Pick up the yellow block, which is now clear, from the table. This action takes another minute.\n4. Stack the yellow block onto the orange block, which is also clear. This action takes an additional minute.\n\nFollowing this sequence, you will successfully achieve the goal in 4 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the blue block and the orange block on top of the red block, we start by addressing the current arrangement. Initially, the blue block is on top of the orange block, and the yellow block is on top of the red block. The red and orange blocks are directly on the table. The first step is to unstack the blue block from the orange block, which clears the orange block. Next, we put down the blue block on the table to free our hand. Then, we unstack the yellow block from the red block, making the red block clear. After placing the yellow block on the table, the red block becomes accessible. We pick up the red block and stack it on top of the blue block. With the red and blue blocks now in their desired relationship, we then pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the red block, completing the necessary arrangement. The sequence of actions ensures a minimal time of 8 minutes by efficiently managing the movements:\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack yellow red)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)",

This removes it from its current position, allowing access and clearance to the orange block.\n\nOnce the red block is unstacked from the orange block, it should be put down on the table.

The goal is to place the blue block on top of the orange block, forming the first part of the desired end state.\n\nAfter picking up the blue block, the next move is to stack it on top of the orange block. This completes the first part of achieving the condition with the blue block directly atop the orange block.\n\nNext, ensure your hand is empty again, allowing you to proceed by picking up the yellow block from where it initially is on the table.\n\nFinally, stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.

        "answer": "Based on the initial conditions, we need to rearrange the blocks to meet the goal: the red block should be on top of the blue block, and the blue block should be on top of the orange block, minimizing the time taken. \n\nInitially, the orange block is on top of the red block, and the red block is on top of the yellow block, which is on top of the blue block on the table. Our approach should focus on freeing up the blue block because it needs to end up at the bottom of the stack.\n\nHere\u2019s the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Unstack the orange block from the red block:** Orange is on top of red, so the first step is to unstack orange from red. This takes 1 minute.\n2. **Put down the orange block:** After unstacking, put the orange block down to free your hand. This takes another 1 minute.\n3. **Unstack the red block from the yellow block:** The red block is currently on top of the yellow block, so unstack the red block from the yellow. This takes 1 minute.\n4. **Put down the red block:** Put down the red block to free your hand. This also takes 1 minute.\n5. **Unstack the yellow block from the blue block:** The yellow block is on top of the blue block, freeing the yellow block by unstacking it. This takes 1 minute.\n6. **Put down the yellow block:** Put the yellow block down to free your hand for the next action. This step takes 1 minute.\n7. **Pick up the blue block:** After unstacking all the blocks above it, pick up the blue block from the table. This takes 1 minute.\n8. **Stack the blue block on top of the orange block:** Place the blue block on the now clear orange block. This step takes 1 minute.\n9. **Pick up the red block:** Now that the blue block is correctly placed, pick up the red block. This takes 1 minute.\n10. **Stack the red block on top of the blue block:** Finally, stack the red block on top of the blue to complete the goal. This takes 1 minute.\n\nBy following these steps, we efficiently rearrange the blocks to achieve the desired configuration in 10 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack orange red)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of arranging the blocks such that the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, and the yellow block is on top of the orange block, here's a detailed description of the steps needed:\n\n1. **Unstack the red block from on top of the blue block:** Since the red block is initially clear, this action will take 1 minute. This leaves the red block in your hand, and the blue block becomes clear.\n\n2. **Put down the red block:** Place the red block on the table. This step takes 1 minute and will leave your hand empty.\n\n3. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block:** With the hand now empty, unstack the blue block from the clear orange block. This requires another 1 minute.\n\n4. **Stack the blue block on top of the red block:** With the blue block in hand, stack it on the clear red block, taking 1 minute. The blue block is now resting on the red block.\n\n5. **Pick up the orange block:** Since the orange block is clear (and on the table), picking it up takes 1 minute.\n\n6. **Stack the orange block on top of the blue block:** Now stack the orange block on the clear blue block, taking another minute. This makes the orange block sit on top of the blue block.\n\n7. **Pick up the yellow block:** Since the yellow block is clear and on the table, you pick it up, taking 1 minute.\n\n8. **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block:** Finally, stack the yellow block on the clear orange block, completing the desired stack in 1 minute.\n\nEach action follows the constraints and ensures the hand is used efficiently to reach the goal arrangement in a minimal time. \n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of stacking the blocks such that the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, and the yellow block is on top of the blue block, we need to carefully execute a series of actions while adhering to the rules provided. Initially, we begin with the red block being clear and on top of the orange block. The orange block is on top of the blue block, which is on the table, and the yellow block is also on the table.\n\n1. Begin by unstacking the red block from the orange block, as it is clear and can be picked up.\n2. Place the red block on the table, freeing up your hand and the orange block.\n3. Since the orange block is now clear, unstack it from the blue block beneath.\n4. Put down the orange block on the table, again freeing up your hand.\n5. With the hand free, pick up the blue block from the table.\n6. Stack the blue block on top of the orange block to achieve the desired position.\n7. Now, pick up the yellow block from the table as it is clear.\n8. Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block, achieving the second part of the goal.\n9. Lastly, with your hand free once more, pick up the red block.\n10. Stack the red block on top of the yellow block to complete the goal.\n\nFollowing these steps will ensure the blocks are arranged as needed, all while adhering to the rules set out in the problem statement.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack red orange)  \n(put-down red)  \n(unstack orange blue)  \n(put-down orange)  \n(pick-up blue)  \n(stack blue orange)  \n(pick-up yellow)  \n(stack yellow blue)  \n(pick-up red)  \n(stack red yellow)  ",

        "answer": "To solve the problem and achieve the desired stack configuration, we'll follow a sequence of actions starting from the given initial conditions. The process involves manipulating blocks in a particular order to reassemble them according to the goal structure. Our objective is to efficiently rearrange the blocks while minimizing the time spent. Here's how we do it:\n\n1. We begin by unstacking the blue block from on top of the yellow block. This action takes 1 minute.\n2. Next, we put down the blue block onto the table, which also takes 1 minute.\n3. We then unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block, taking another minute.\n4. The yellow block is then placed on the table (put down), using another minute.\n5. We proceed by unstacking the orange block from on top of the red block. This takes us one more minute.\n6. The orange block is then put down, consuming another minute.\n7. Now, we pick up the red block, using 1 minute.\n8. We stack the red block on top of the orange block, taking another minute.\n9. Following this, we pick up the blue block once again, using 1 minute.\n10. We stack the blue block on top of the red block, spending another minute.\n11. Finally, we pick up the yellow block and stack it on top of the blue block, rounding up with one last minute.\n\nBy precisely following this plan, starting from the initial conditions, we are able to rearrange the blocks as required in the minimal possible time.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack orange red)\n(put-down orange)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)",
