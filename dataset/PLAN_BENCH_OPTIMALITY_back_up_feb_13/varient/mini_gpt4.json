        "answer": "To achieve the goal of placing the orange block on top of the red block, we will need to perform several actions while adhering to the restrictions of unstacking and stacking.\n\n1. The first step is to unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block. This is necessary because the yellow block is currently blocking access to the orange block, which we need to pick up later.\n\n2. Once the yellow block is unstacked, we will need to put it down. This action clears our hand so we can pick up the orange block.\n\n3. After putting down the yellow block, we will pick up the orange block. This step is necessary so we can stack it onto the red block later.\n\n4. Finally, we will stack the orange block on top of the red block. This completes our goal.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total time required for these actions:\n- Unstacking the yellow block from the orange block: 1 minute\n- Putting down the yellow block: 1 minute\n- Picking up the orange block: 1 minute\n- Stacking the orange block on the red block: 1 minute\n\nTotal time: 4 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)",

        "answer": "To achieve your goal of having the red block on top of the orange block and the yellow block on top of the red block, we need to carefully follow the given constraints and perform the necessary actions to rearrange the blocks. \n\n1. Start with the initial configuration where the blue block is on top of the orange block, which is on top of the yellow block, that is on top of the red block. The red block is clear but the blue block needs to be moved first.\n\n2. The first action is to unstack the blue block from the orange block. This step takes 1 minute.\n\n3. Next, we need to put down the blue block. This also takes 1 minute, bringing the total time to 2 minutes.\n\n4. Now, we can unstack the orange block from the yellow block. This action takes 1 minute, resulting in a total of 3 minutes.\n\n5. We then put down the orange block, bringing our total time to 4 minutes.\n\n6. Next, we unstack the yellow block from the red block, which takes 1 minute, bringing the total to 5 minutes.\n\n7. After that, we stack the yellow block on top of the blue block. This step takes 1 minute, increasing the total time to 6 minutes.\n\n8. We pick up the red block next, which takes 1 minute, leading the total time to 7 minutes.\n\n9. We then stack the red block on top of the orange block. This will take another minute so our total is now 8 minutes.\n\n10. Now we unstack the yellow block from the blue block, which costs another minute, increasing the total to 9 minutes.\n\n11.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of placing the red block on top of the blue block, we need to follow the restrictions and conditions provided. \n\n1. Initially, the orange block is clear and is sitting on the blue block, which means we need to unstack the orange block from the blue block first. \n2. After unstacking the orange block, we will put it down so we can manipulate the arrangement.\n3. Next, we need to unstack the yellow block from the red block. This requires that we first put down the orange block and then pick up the yellow block.\n4. Once the yellow block is unstacked, we put it down, then pick up the red block, and finally stack the red block on top of the blue block.\n\nFollowing this logical sequence of steps ensures we adhere to the rules about picking up, unstacking, putting down, and stacking blocks.\n\nNow for the final plan:\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange blue)  \n(put-down orange)  \n(unstack yellow red)  \n(put-down yellow)  \n(pick-up red)  \n(stack red blue)",

We need to ensure that we can manipulate the blocks without violating the restrictions, focusing on how to unstack and stack the blocks appropriately.\n\n**Plan Breakdown:**\n1. **Unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block.** - This is necessary because we want the red block to be available to stack later.\n2. **Put down the red block.** - After unstacking, we will place the red block back on the table so it can be stacked on later.\n3. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block.** - We will need to free the orange block to eventually stack it on the yellow block.\n4. **Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block.** - This helps set up the final configuration where the yellow block should eventually be underneath the orange block.\n5. **Pick up the blue block.** - We need to place the blue block in a position to stack it on the red block.\n6. **Stack the blue block on top of the red block.** - Now we have the blue block on top of the red block as required by the goal state.\n7. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block.** - We will now need to free the orange block again.\n8. **Stack the orange block on top of the blue block.** - This moves the orange block into the final position on top of the blue block.\n9. **Pick up the yellow block.** - This prepares the yellow block to be placed on top of the orange block.\n10. **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block.** - This completes the goal state.\n\nThe execution of this plan totals 10 minutes, considering each action takes 1 minute.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack red yellow) \n(put-down red) \n(unstack orange blue) \n(stack orange yellow) \n(pick-up blue) \n(stack blue red) \n(unstack orange yellow) \n(stack orange blue) \n(pick-up yellow) \n(stack yellow orange) ",

Initially, the red block is on top of the orange block, and the blue block is on top of the red block. Since we want the red block to eventually be on top of the blue block, we first need to unstack the blue block from the red block.\n\n2. Next, after unstacking the blue block, we need to put it down on the table to make it clear so that we can later stack it on top of the yellow block.\n\n3. Now that we have put down the blue block, we need to unstack the red block from the orange block and put it down on the table, as we need to move it.\n\n4. With the red block now on the table, we can pick up the yellow block, which is clear, and stack it on top of the orange block.\n\n5.

Our goal is to rearrange the blocks so that the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the red block, and the yellow block is on top of the orange block.\n\n1.

Since the yellow block is currently on top of the blue block and needs to be removed first, we start with unstacking the yellow block from the blue block to make the blue block clear. \n2. After unstacking the yellow block, we need to put it down to free our hands.\n3.

This action is valid as the yellow block is clear and it\u2019s on top of the red block.\n  \n2. **Put down the yellow block**: After unstacking, we need to put down the yellow block since it\u2019s no longer stacked on the red.\n\n3. **Unstack the red block from the blue block**: Here, we are now holding the red block, which allows us to unstack it from the blue block.\n\n4. **Stack the red block on top of the yellow block**: We can then stack the red block on the yellow block, which at this point is on the table.\n\n5. **Unstack the blue block from the orange block**: Now, we unstack the blue block from the orange block.\n\n6. **Put down the blue block**: With the blue block in hand, we put it down as we will stack the red on the orange next.\n\n7. **Unstack the red block from the yellow block**: Since we just put down the blue block, we need to release the yellow block first by unstacking the red from her.\n\n8. **Stack the red block on the orange block**: Finally, we stack the red block on top of the orange block, achieving part of our goal.\n\n9. **Pick up the yellow block**: After organizing that, we need to get yellow back in hand so we can position it next.\n\n10. **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block**: Finally, we stack the yellow block on the blue block to achieve the second part of our goal.\n\nNow, by following the outlined steps, we can determine that the overall execution time equals 9 minutes based on the individual time requirements for each action. \n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack yellow red)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack red blue)\n(stack red yellow)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(stack red orange)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)",

This removes the red block from the current stack it's part of.\n- Then, **put down the red block** on the table.\n- Now, **unstack the blue block** from the orange block. This requires that the blue block is clear, which it should be since it is above the orange block.\n- **Stack the blue block** on top of the yellow block.\n- Finally, **pick up the red block** and **stack the red block** on top of the orange block.\n\nNow, every action noted takes one minute, and following this plan should allow us to reach the goal of the arrangement as specified. \n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow red)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the red block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is on top of the blue block, we need to follow these steps logically given the initial conditions.\n\n1. The `orange` block is on top of the `red` block which means we need to unstack `orange` from `red`. Before that, we need to ensure that `red` is clear after moving `orange`.\n\n2. We will `unstack` the `orange` block from the `red` block, which takes 1 minute. Now we can put down `orange`, taking another minute.\n\n3. Then, we'll need to `unstack` the `red` block from the `blue` block, taking another minute. After this, we'll put down the `red` block on the table which takes 1 minute.\n\n4. Next, we pick up the `yellow` block (1 minute) and stack it on the `blue` block (1 minute). Now the `yellow` block is on top of the `blue` block.\n\n5. Now we will pick up the `orange` block (1 minute) and stack it on the `yellow` block (1 minute) to fulfill part of our goal.\n\n6. Finally, we can pick up the `red` block (1 minute) and stack it on top of the `orange` block (1 minute).\n\nCounting the time taken:\n- Unstack `orange` from `red` (1 min)\n- Put down `orange` (1 min)\n- Unstack `red` from `blue` (1 min)\n- Put down `red` (1 min)\n- Pick up `yellow` (1 min)\n- Stack `yellow` on `blue` (1 min)\n- Pick up `orange` (1 min)\n- Stack `orange` on `yellow` (1 min)\n- Pick up `red` (1 min)\n- Stack `red` on `orange` (1 min)\n\nTotal time taken is 10 minutes.\n\nThus, the correct and final plan we would execute is as follows:\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange red)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the red block is on top of the yellow block and the orange block is on top of the blue block, I will analyze the initial conditions and plan the sequence of actions accordingly. \n\nInitially, the following conditions apply:\n- The blue block is clear and on top of the red block.\n- The red block is on top of the yellow block.\n- The yellow block is on top of the orange block.\n- The orange block is on the table, and my hand is empty.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. To get the red block on top of the yellow block, I need to clear the blue block as it is currently not clear.\n2. Therefore, I should first unstack the blue block from the red block.\n3. Next, I will put the blue block down to make it clear again and free my hands for other actions.\n4. After that, I will unstack the red block from the yellow block.\n5. I can now stack the red block on top of the blue block.\n6. Next, I need to unstack the yellow block from the orange block.\n7. Put down the yellow block to keep my hand free and prepare for future stacking.\n8. I will then unstack the red block from the blue block (which now will have to be placed back to its original position).\n9. Stack the red block back on the yellow block.\n10. After this, I can pick up the orange block and finally stack the orange block on top of the blue block.\n\n### Execution of the Actions:\nThe steps derived above lead us to the following sequence of actions, which ensures that I achieve the goal in a minimal time:\n\n1. Unstack the blue block from the red block (1 min).\n2. Put down the blue block (1 min).\n3. Unstack the red block from the yellow block (1 min).\n4. Stack the red block on the blue block (1 min).\n5. Unstack the yellow block from the orange block (1 min).\n6. Put down the yellow block (1 min).\n7. Unstack the red block from the blue block (1 min).\n8. Stack the red block on the yellow block (1 min).\n9. Pick up the orange block (1 min).\n10. Stack the orange block on top of the blue block (1 min).\n\nAfter analyzing, it turns out that the sequence provided in the \"Final Plan\" above successfully matches the intended actions to achieve the goal.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(stack red blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack red blue)\n(stack red yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the blue block is on top of the red block and the yellow block is on top of the orange block, we start with the given conditions. \n\n1. The blue block is clear and on top of the yellow block.\n2. The yellow block is on top of the red block.\n3. The red block is on top of the orange block.\n\nTo reach the goal efficiently, we need to manipulate the blocks as follows:\n\n- First, we need to unstack the blue block from the yellow block, which allows the yellow block to be handled separately.\n- After putting down the blue block, we can then unstack the yellow block from the red block.\n- Once the yellow block is down and the red block is clear, we can stack the yellow block on top of the orange block.\n- Next, we can pick up the blue block again and stack it on top of the newly positioned red block.\n\nBy evaluating each action based on the restrictions and the initial state, we derive the following steps:\n\n1. Unstack blue from yellow (requires that yellow is cleared).\n2. Put down blue (blue is now on the table).\n3. Unstack yellow from red (now yellow is on the table).\n4. Stack yellow on orange (this satisfies the requirement that yellow is now on the orange block).\n5. Pick up blue again (blue is clear and on the table).\n6. Stack blue on red (completing the goal state).\n\nThus, each of these steps corresponds to actions of unstacking, putting down, picking up, and stacking, respecting the restrictions provided.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack yellow red)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue red)",

This means now the red block is in our hand and the orange block is clear.\n   \n2. **Put down the red block**: After unstacking it, we can put down the red block on the table, making our hand empty again. Now, the red block is clear on the table. \n\n3. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block**: The orange block is on top of the yellow block, and since the orange block is clear now, we can unstack it. After this step, we will hold the orange block, and the yellow block will also become clear.\n\n4. **Put down the orange block**: We will now put down the orange block on the table, which makes our hand empty again. \n\n5. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block**: Now, the yellow block is on the blue block, and since the yellow block is clear, we can unstack it. Now, we will hold the yellow block and the blue block will remain clear.\n\n6. **Put down the yellow block**: We put down the yellow block, and it is now on the table.\n\n7. **Pick up the blue block**: Now, we will pick up the blue block again since it is clear.\n\n8. **Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block**: Next, we stack the blue block on top of the yellow block to fulfill part of our goal. The yellow block now has the blue block on top and is thus no longer clear.\n\n9. **Pick up the red block**: We pick up the red block from the table again.\n\n10. **Stack the red block on top of the blue block**: Finally, we stack the red block on top of the blue block to meet the final goal.\n\nThus, after following the steps and ensuring all conditions are met, we arrive at the following plan:\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)",

        "answer": "To reach the goal of having the orange block on top of the yellow block, we need to analyze the current conditions and the movement of blocks.\n\n1. The yellow block is currently on top of the orange block. To free the orange block so that we can eventually place it on the yellow block, we'll need to unstack the yellow block from the orange block first.\n2. After unstacking the yellow block, we will need to put it down, which allows us to then pick up the orange block.\n3. Finally, we can stack the orange block on top of the yellow block.\n\nLet\u2019s break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block**: This is necessary to expose the orange block.\n2. **Put down the yellow block**: This action allows the yellow block to be placed on the table, making our hands free to deal with the orange block.\n3. **Pick up the orange block**: Now we are ready to pick up the orange block that we previously unstacked.\n4. **Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block**: This final action achieves the goal of having the orange block on top of the yellow block.\n\nThe actions reflect the plan accurately per the rules stated and respect the conditions of block interaction.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the yellow block, we need to arrange the blocks according to the restrictions provided. Here's how the inference proceeds:\n\n1. Initially, the yellow block is clear and can be put down.\n2. The blue block is on top of the red block, and the orange block is on top of the blue block. Therefore, we can unstack the orange block from the blue block, as it is clear.\n3. After unstacking orange, we put it down. Now, we will unstack the blue block from the red block.\n4. With the blue block unstacked, we then put it down. Next, we can pick up the red block.\n5. Now that we have the red block, we can stack it on top of the yellow block.\n\nFollowing this logic, the plan is:\n\n(unstack yellow from orange): Allows yellow to be put down and clear for stacking later.\n(put-down yellow): Now yellow is on the table.\n(unstack orange from blue): Gets orange off the blue block.\n(put-down orange): Places orange on the table again.\n(unstack blue from red): Releases blue from above red.\n(put-down blue): Now blue is on the table.\n(pick-up red): We can now pick up the red block.\n(stack red on yellow): Finally, place red on top of yellow.\n\nThis entire process follows the restrictions and achieves the desired goal in the minimum time.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red yellow)",

With the orange block in my hand, I can stack it on top of the blue block, making the blue block no longer clear and fulfilling part of the goal.\n5. Next, I can pick up the yellow block, which is also clear on the table.\n6. I will stack the yellow block on top of the orange block. This places the yellow block on top of the orange block, making the orange block below it.\n7. Finally, I can pick up the red block again, and since the yellow block is now clear, I can stack the red block on the yellow block.\n\nThis sequence of actions results in the desired arrangement while also adhering to the restrictions placed on the actions. \n\nCalculating the time taken:\n- Unstack red from blue (1 minute)\n- Put down red (1 minute)\n- Pick up orange (1 minute)\n- Stack orange on blue (1 minute)\n- Pick up yellow (1 minute)\n- Stack yellow on orange (1 minute)\n- Pick up red (1 minute)\n- Stack red on yellow (1 minute)\n\nTotal time is 8 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red yellow)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the orange block on top of the red block and the yellow block on top of the orange block, we can follow these steps by reasoning through the actions allowed and the initial conditions:\n\n1. **Initial conditions**:\n   - The red block is clear and on top of the blue block.\n   - The blue block is on top of the yellow block.\n   - The yellow block is on top of the orange block.\n   - The orange block is on the table.\n   - The hand is empty.\n\n2. **Goal states**:\n   - Orange block on top of red block.\n   - Yellow block on top of orange block.\n\n3. **Action plan**:\n   - **Unstack the red block from the blue block**: \n     - This is possible because the red block is clear and I can unstack it. The hand will now hold the red block.\n   - **Put down the red block**: \n     - This puts the red block down and now the hand is empty.\n   - **Unstack the blue block from the yellow block**: \n     - This is possible because the blue block is on top of the yellow block and the blue block is clear.\n   - **Put down the blue block**: \n     - The blue block is now on the table and the hand is empty.\n   - **Unstack the yellow block from the orange block**: \n     - This can be done because yellow is clear on top of orange.\n   - **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block**: \n     - Now the yellow block is on the blue block. The hand is empty again after this action.\n   - **Pick up the orange block**: \n     - The hand is empty and I can pick up the orange block from the table.\n   - **Stack the orange block on top of the red block**: \n     - Now the orange block is on top of the red block.

Start with the initial conditions: \n   - The red block is clear. \n   - The blue block is clear. \n   - The orange block is clear. \n   - The hand is empty. \n   - The orange block is stacked on the yellow block.\n   - The red block is on the table.\n   - The blue block is on the table.\n   - The yellow block is on the table.\n\n2. My goal is to have the red block on top of the yellow block and the orange block on top of the red block.\n\n3. Given that the red block is clear, I can pick it up from the table directly. \n\n4. To place the red block on the yellow block, I first need to ensure the yellow block is clear. The yellow block is currently not clear because the orange block is on top of it. Therefore, the first step must be to unstack the orange block from the yellow block.\n\n5. Once the orange block is unstacked and the yellow block is clear, I can put the orange block down.\n\n6. The next step is to pick up the red block and stack it on the now-clear yellow block.\n\n7. After placing the red block on the yellow block, the final goal requires stacking the orange block on top of the red block. Before I can do this, I need to ensure the orange block is moved off the table. I will need to unstack the orange block from the yellow block (if it's still there) and then stack it on the red block.\n\n8. Finally, stack the orange block on top of the red block.\n\nThus, the detailed actions would be:\n\n1. Unstack the orange block from the yellow block.\n2. Put down the orange block (now not on the yellow block).\n3. Pick up the red block.\n4. Stack the red block on the yellow block.\n5. Unstack the orange block from wherever it is.\n6. Stack the orange block on the red block.\n\nThese maneuvers provide a clear sequence to reach the desired configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange yellow)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red yellow)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(stack orange red)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of placing the orange block on top of the blue block, we need to follow the constraints provided and execute actions based on the current conditions.\n\n1. From the initial conditions, the blue block is clear and the hand is empty. However, the orange block is not directly accessible since it's currently on top of the red block, which itself is on top of the yellow block.\n\n2. To proceed, we first need to make the orange block accessible. Therefore, we will unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block. This allows us to keep the blue block clear, as removing the blue block (if it's on the orange block) makes both the blue and orange blocks available for further actions.\n\n3. Next, we can put down the blue block since we have unstacked it. The blue block will now be on the table, keeping it clear.\n\n4. Now, we need to access the orange block, which remains on top of the red block. To do this, we can unstack the orange block from the red block.\n\n5. After unstacking the orange block, we can then stack it on the blue block, achieving the goal.\n\nThus, the complete plan becomes:\n\n1. Unstack the blue block from the orange block (this is conceptual, as there may need to be further executions based on the layout).\n2. Put down the blue block onto the table.\n3. Unstack the orange block from the red block.\n4. Stack the orange block on top of the blue block.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack orange red)\n(stack orange blue)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal state where the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is on top of the red block, we need to analyze the current block positions and the available actions based on the given restrictions.\n\n1. **Initial Position**: \n   - Red block is on top of the blue block (so the red block is **not** clear).\n   - Orange block is on top of the yellow block (so the orange block is **not** clear).\n   - Both blue and yellow blocks are on the table (**clear**).\n   - The hand is empty.\n\n2. **Goal State**:\n   - Red block on orange block.\n   - Blue block on yellow block.\n   - Yellow block on red block.\n\nFollowing the steps to achieve the goal:\n\n- **Step 1**: Unstack the orange block from the yellow block. This unstack action is valid since the orange block is on top of the yellow block. We go from (orange is clear, yellow is clear) to (orange is now held, yellow is still clear). This action will take 1 minute.\n\n- **Step 2**: Put down the orange block. Now the orange block is back on the table and clear again. This action takes an additional 1 minute.\n\n- **Step 3**: Unstack the red block from the blue block. Now the red block is held and clear, while the blue block is still on the table (now is also clear). This action takes another 1 minute.\n\n- **Step 4**: Stack the red block on the orange block. Both the red block is held and the orange block is clear, so this action takes another 1 minute.\n\n- **Step 5**: Now we need to put the yellow block on the red block. First, we need to pick up the yellow block. This action takes 1 minute.\n\n- **Step 6**: Stack the yellow block on the red block. This action takes 1 minute.\n\n- **Step 7**: Now we can complete the setup by picking up the blue block from the table. This step takes another minute.\n\n- **Step 8**: Finally, stack the blue block on the yellow block. This action takes the last minute.\n\nThe sequence total is 8 actions, each taking 1 minute, making it 8 minutes in total.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack red blue)\n(stack red orange)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue yellow)",

This takes another minute, now totaling 3 minutes.\n4. **Put down the blue block:** Place the blue block back on the table, which takes an additional minute (4 minutes total).\n5. **Pick up the red block:** Now, we will pick up the red block. This takes another minute (5 minutes total).\n6. **Stack the red block on top of the orange block:** After picking up the red block, we will stack it onto the orange block, which takes a minute, bringing our total to 6 minutes.\n7. **Pick up the yellow block:** Next, we will pick up the yellow block (7 minutes total).\n8. **Stack the yellow block on top of the red block:** Now, we stack the yellow block onto the red block (8 minutes total).\n9. **Pick up the blue block:** Finally, we pick up the blue block (9 minutes total).\n10. **Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block:** We stack the blue block on top of the yellow block (10 minutes total).\n\nBy following through all these steps with careful consideration of what blocks are clear and available for stacking and unstacking, we accomplish our goal.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow blue)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue yellow)",

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the inference process:\n\n1. The red block is clear and on the table. The yellow block is also clear but it is on the table, so we can directly stack blocks on it.\n2. We want to stack the red block on top of the yellow block. Currently, the yellow block is on the table, and to stack the red block on it, we need to ensure that the yellow block remains clear.\n3. The blue block is on top of the orange block, and both are currently stable (not moving).\n4. To make the yellow block the base for the red block while maintaining clear conditions, we will first unstack the blue block from the orange block.\n5. After unstacking and putting down the blue block, the orange block becomes clear, allowing us to then unstack the yellow block from it.\n6. Once the yellow block is clear and on the table, we can pick up the red block and place it on the yellow block.\n\nLet's summarize the required actions:\n\n1. Unstack the blue block from the orange block (this takes 1 minute).\n2. Put down the blue block on the table (this takes 1 minute).\n3. Unstack the orange block from the yellow block (this takes 1 minute).\n4. Put down the orange block on the table (this takes 1 minute).\n5.

This means it must be placed on a clear surface, such as the table.\n3. **Pick up the yellow block**: Now that the blue block is on the table, we can pick up the yellow block, since it's clear.\n4. **Stack the yellow block on top of the red block**: Now that we are holding the yellow block, we can stack it onto the red block, which is clear and on the table.\n5. **Pick up the orange block**: Next, we need to pick up the orange block, which is also clear and on the table.\n6. **Stack the orange block on top of the newly stacked yellow block**: Now we can stack the orange block on top of the yellow block, completing the required order.\n7. **Pick up the blue block again**: Finally, we can pick up the blue block that is on the table, as it's clear.\n8. **Stack the blue block on top of the orange block**: With the blue block in hand, we can now stack it on top of the orange block.\n\nThus, the complete order of actions is:\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the blue block, the blue block on top of the yellow block, and the orange block on top of the red block, we need to consider the initial conditions and restrictions provided.\n\n1. **Initial conditions:**\n   - The orange block is clear.\n   - The yellow block is clear.\n   - The hand is empty.\n   - The blue block is on top of the red block.\n   - The yellow block is on top of the blue block.\n   - The red block is on the table.\n   - The orange block is on the table.\n\n2. **Current stacking situation:**\n   - `Yellow` is on top of `Blue`, and `Blue` is on top of `Red`.\n   - `Red` is clear, and `Yellow` is holding `Blue`, making `Blue` not clear as it is stacked with another block.\n\n3. **Goal:**\n   - Achieve the stack: \n     1. Red on top of Blue\n     2. Blue on top of Yellow\n     3. Orange on top of Red\n\nTo execute this plan, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Unstack yellow from blue:**\n   - This can be done since yellow is on top of blue and clear.\n\n2. **Put down yellow:**\n   - The yellow block can be put down since I am holding it now.\n\n3. **Unstack blue from red:**\n   - This unstacking is possible because blue is clear now with the red block on the table.\n\n4. **Stack blue on yellow:**\n   - Once blue is unstacked and in hand, we can put it on yellow, which is clear on the table.\n\n5. **Pick up red:**\n   - After stacking blue, I will pick up red, which is now clear (since blue has been unstacked).\n\n6. **Stack red on blue:**\n   - Stack red onto blue, which is now clear after it has been stacked with yellow.\n\n7. **Pick up orange:**\n   - The orange block is clear on the table.\n\n8. **Stack orange on red:**\n   - Finally, stack orange on red, completing the goal structure.\n\nBy analyzing these steps, the process and total time taken would add up as follows:\n\n1. Unstack yellow from blue - 1 minute\n2. Put down yellow - 1 minute\n3. Unstack blue from red - 1 minute\n4. Stack blue on yellow - 1 minute\n5. Pick up red - 1 minute\n6. Stack red on blue - 1 minute\n7. Pick up orange - 1 minute\n8. Stack orange on red - 1 minute\n\nTotal time taken would be 8 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow blue)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack blue red)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)",

After that, we will need to unstack the yellow block from the orange block, allowing us to manipulate the red and yellow blocks.\n5. Next, we need to pick up the red block and stack it on top of the yellow block.\n6.

This action will take 1 minute.\n   \n2. **Stack Yellow on Red:** After unstacking, we can put down the yellow block back onto the red block. Since the red block is on the table and clear, this action takes another minute.\n\n3. **Unstack Blue on Orange:** Next, we unstack the blue block from the orange block. The blue block is currently on top of the orange block, and it is clear. This action takes another minute.\n\n4. **Put Down Blue:** After unstacking, we put down the blue block. This takes an additional minute.\n\n5. **Pick Up Orange:** We then pick up the orange block, which is still on the table and clear. This action takes 1 minute.\n\n6. **Stack Orange on Yellow:** Now we stack the orange block onto the yellow block, which is now on top of the red block. This action takes 1 minute.\n\n7. **Pick Up Blue:** Finally, we pick up the blue block again.

Yellow block on top of the red block.\n\nStep-by-step inference:\n1. **Unstack yellow from blue**: This is our initial action since the yellow block is clear and can be unstacked from the blue block. (1 minute)\n2. **Put down yellow**: Now that we have unstacked the yellow block, we can put it down on the table, and our hand becomes empty again. (2 minutes)\n3. **Unstack red from orange**: The red block is on top of the orange block. Now we can unstack the red block since it is clear. (3 minutes)\n4. **Stack red on yellow**: Now we stack the red block on top of where we put down the yellow block.

(5 minutes)\n6. **Stack blue on orange**: We stack the blue block on the orange block, which is also on the table.

(7 minutes)\n8. **Stack red on blue**: The red block, now in our hand, can be stacked on top of the blue block.

This step also makes it clear for the next action.\n3. **Unstack the red block from yellow**: The red block is currently on top of the yellow block. We need to unstack the red block so that we can stack it on top of the orange block. \n4. **Stack the red block on the orange block**: After unstacking the red block, stack it on top of the orange block. Now the orange block is no longer clear.\n5. **Pick up the blue block**: With the orange block occupied, pick up the blue block, which is now clear on the table.\n6. **Stack the blue block on the red block**: Finally, stack the blue block on the red block, achieving the desired configuration.\n\nNow checking the plan:\n\n- Process 1 (unstack orange from blue): 1 minute\n- Process 2 (put down orange): 1 minute\n- Process 3 (unstack red from yellow): 1 minute\n- Process 4 (stack red on orange): 1 minute\n- Process 5 (pick up blue): 1 minute\n- Process 6 (stack blue on red): 1 minute\n\nTotal time: 6 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(stack red orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue red)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is on top of the red block, we will first note the initial conditions. \n\nInitially:\n- The red block is clear.\n- The blue block is clear.\n- The hand is empty.\n- The red block is on top of the orange block.\n- The blue block is on top of the yellow block.\n- The orange block is on the table.\n- The yellow block is on the table.\n\nThe goal arrangement requires:\n1. Blue block on top of orange block.\n2. Orange block on top of yellow block.\n3. Yellow block on top of red block.\n\nAnalyzing the actions needed:\n1. To place the yellow block on top of the red block, we first need to unstack the blue block from the yellow block since we are currently restricted by the blue block being on top of the yellow.\n2. Once the blue block is unstacked and put down, we can pick up the yellow block and stack it on the red block.\n3. Next, we will pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the yellow block.\n4. Finally, we can pick up the blue block and stack it on top of the orange block.\n\nCalculating the time:\n- Each action, including unstacking, putting down, picking up, and stacking, costs 1 minute.\nFollowing the sequence of actions detailed in the plan:\n1. Unstack blue from yellow (1 minute)\n2. Put down blue (1 minute)\n3. Unstack yellow from red (1 minute)\n4. Put down yellow (1 minute)\n5. Pick up red (1 minute)\n6. Stack red on yellow (1 minute)\n7. Pick up orange (1 minute)\n8. Stack orange on yellow (1 minute)\n9. Pick up blue (1 minute)\n10. Stack blue on orange (1 minute)\n\nTotal time = 10 minutes\n\nTherefore, the sequence of movements in the plan will successfully achieve the goal configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)",

Blue is stacked on Red.\n   - **(put-down blue)**: This action is invalid as I am not holding blue (the previous action did not occur).\n   - **(unstack red orange)**: Invalid as R is not on the table; it is on O.\n   - **(put-down red)**: Invalid action as R is not picked up.\n   - **(unstack orange yellow)**: Valid, as O is on Y.\n   - **(put-down orange)**: Valid after unstacking O.\n   - **(pick-up yellow)**: Valid, as Y is on the table.\n   - **(stack yellow blue)**: This is invalid, cannot stack Y onto B since Y will be on top of B (which violates clear status) and B must be clear. \n   - Following this, actions related to R and O stacking again become invalid due to the sequence not starting correctly.\n\nBased on the restrictions and initial setup, the proposed actions do not correctly follow the constraints and will not yield the intended outcome. \n\nGiven the logic laid out, a refined strategy should be structured as follows:\n\n1.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, and the yellow block is on top of the orange block, we need to carefully consider the current arrangement and the actions allowed. \n\nInitially, we have the following configuration: \n- The red block is clear and on the table.\n- The orange block is clear and on the table.\n- The yellow block is on the table.\n- The blue block is on top of the yellow block.\n- The orange block is on top of the blue block.\n\nNow, let\u2019s break down the necessary steps:\n\n1. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block.**\n   - The orange block is currently on the blue block, so we can unstack it.\n   - This action will take 1 minute.\n\n2. **Put down the orange block.**\n   - After unstacking, we must put down the orange block on the table.\n   - This will take another 1 minute.\n\n3. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block.**\n   - With the orange block now off of the blue block, we can unstack the blue block which is on top of the yellow block.\n   - This will take 1 minute.\n\n4. **Stack the blue block on the red block.**\n   - Now, we can stack the blue block that we just unstacked on top of the clear red block.\n   - This action will take 1 minute.\n\n5. **Pick up the orange block.**\n   - With our hand now empty, we can pick up the orange block that we just put down.\n   - This will also take 1 minute.\n\n6. **Stack the orange block on top of the blue block.**\n   - Now, we stack the orange block that we picked up on the blue block.\n   - This will take 1 minute.\n\n7. **Pick up the yellow block.**\n   - Finally, we can pick up the yellow block which is still on the table.\n   - This will take 1 minute.\n\n8. **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block.**\n   - We stack the yellow block on top of the orange block to complete the arrangement.\n   - This will take 1 minute.\n\nCalculating the total time taken:\n1. Unstack orange (1 minute)\n2. Put down orange (1 minute)\n3. Unstack blue (1 minute)\n4. Stack blue on red (1 minute)\n5. Pick up orange (1 minute)\n6. Stack orange on blue (1 minute)\n7.

Stack the orange block on top of the blue block (the blue block is on the table so it will not affect the stacking).\n7. Pick up the yellow block (as it is now available on the table).\n8.

This takes 1 minute.\n   \n2. **Put down the red block**: \n   - Now, we put the red block down on the table. This takes 1 minute.\n\n3. **Unstack the blue block from the orange block**: \n   - We now need to make the blue block clear to put the yellow block on it. The blue block is on top of the orange block, so we can unstack the blue block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n4. **Put down the blue block**: \n   - We will put the blue block down on the table. This takes 1 minute.\n\n5. **Pick up the yellow block**: \n   - Now that the blue block is down, we can pick up the yellow block to place it on top of the blue block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n6. **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block**: \n   - We stack the yellow block on top of the blue block. This takes 1 minute. \n\n7. **Pick up the red block**: \n   - After stacking the yellow block, we can now pick up the red block again. This takes 1 minute.\n\n8. **Stack the red block on top of the yellow block**: \n   - We stack the red block on top of the yellow block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n9. **Pick up the orange block**: \n   - Next, we pick up the orange block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n10. **Stack the orange block on top of the red block**: \n    - Finally, we stack the orange block on top of the red block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n### Total Time Calculation\nThe total time to execute this plan is:\n1 (unstack red blue) + 1 (put-down red) + 1 (unstack blue orange) + 1 (put-down blue) + 1 (pick-up yellow) + 1 (stack yellow blue) + 1 (pick-up red) + 1 (stack red yellow) + 1 (pick-up orange) + 1 (stack orange red) = 10 minutes.\n\n### Final Answer\nFinal Answer: (unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)",

Next, we pick up the yellow block and stack it on top of the blue block, resulting in a configuration where the yellow block is now on top of the blue block. \n\nAfter this, we will need to unstack the orange block from on top of the red block, which takes another minute, and then put down the orange block (another minute). We then pick up the red block and stack it on top of the yellow block, completing the desired arrangement.\n\nIn total, the sequence of actions will take 8 minutes:\n1. Unstack blue from orange (1 minute)\n2. Put down blue (1 minute)\n3. Pick up yellow (1 minute)\n4. Stack yellow on blue (1 minute)\n5. Unstack orange from red (1 minute)\n6. Put down orange (1 minute)\n7. Pick up red (1 minute)\n8. Stack red on yellow (1 minute)\n\nThus, the planned actions are as follows:\n1. Unstack the blue block from the orange block.\n2.

Currently, the red block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on the table. The blue block is on top of the red block, and the orange block is on top of the blue block.\n2. The goal arrangement cannot be achieved directly because the blocks are currently stacked in a way that limits access to the yellow and red blocks.\n3.

We pick up Orange and stack it on Yellow, while ensuring to stack Yellow on Blue earlier so that we maintain the three conditions for successful stacking.\n\nIn sequence, this means:\n\n1.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the blue block and the orange block on top of the red block, we analyze the initial conditions and the actions available.\n\nInitially, the conditions state that:\n- The red block is clear (meaning no blocks are on top of it).\n- The yellow block is on top of the orange block, which means it cannot be put down or stacked until it is unstacked.\n- The blue block is clear and on the table.\n- The orange block is also on the table but has the yellow block on top of it, making it not clear for picking up.\n\nTo stack the blocks in the desired order, the following logical steps must be taken:\n\n1. **Unstack the yellow block from the orange block**: The yellow block must be unstacked first since it is currently on the orange block.\n2. **Put down the yellow block**: After unstacking, the yellow block needs to be placed on the table to free the orange block.\n3. **Pick up the orange block**: Once the yellow block is put down, you can pick up the orange block.\n4. **Stack the orange block on top of the red block**: With the orange block in hand, you can now stack it on top of the red block.\n5. **Finally, stack the red block on top of the blue block**: With the red block on top of the orange block, you can finish by stacking the red block on the blue block.\n\nThe detailed steps with timing would be:\n\n1. Unstack yellow from orange (1 minute).\n2. Put down yellow (1 minute).\n3. Pick up orange (1 minute).\n4. Stack orange on red (1 minute).\n5. Stack red on blue (1 minute).\n\nNow calculating the total time:\n- **Total time = 1 (unstack yellow) + 1 (put down yellow) + 1 (pick up orange) + 1 (stack orange on red) + 1 (stack red on blue) = 5 minutes.**\n\nNow, documenting the selected actions in the specified format:\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)",

This takes 1 minute.\n2. **Put down the red block**: To create space for stacking, we need to put down the red block. This takes 1 minute.\n3. **Unstack the yellow block from the blue block**: Now we can unstack the yellow block from the blue block. This takes 1 minute.\n4. **Put down the yellow block**: After unstacking, we put down the yellow block. This takes 1 minute.\n5. **Unstack the blue block from the orange block**: Next, we unstack the blue block from the orange block. This takes 1 minute.\n6. **Put down the blue block**: Now that we have unstacked the blue block, we put it down. This takes 1 minute.\n7. **Pick up the orange block**: Next, we need to pick up the orange block from the table. This takes 1 minute.\n8. **Stack the orange block on top of the red block**: Now, we can stack the orange block on top of the red block. This takes 1 minute.\n9. **Pick up the yellow block**: After stacking the orange block, we need to pick up the yellow block.

We need to unstack the blue block from the yellow block since the blue block is currently resting on the yellow block, which is against our goal. This action is valid as the blue block is clear.\n2. Put the blue block down, allowing us to manage the next steps without interference.\n3. Then we need to unstack the red block from the orange block so we can rearrange them.\n4.

The red block is currently clear and on top of the blue block.\n\n2. To get the blue block onto the yellow block, we first need to unstack the blue block from the orange block since we cannot stack the blue block directly onto the yellow block while it is still on top of the red and orange blocks.\n\n3. The next step would involve putting down the blue block onto the table, freeing the orange block.\n\n4. Then we would unstack the orange block from the yellow block, which ensures that the orange block is clear and can be put down.\n\n5. After that, we can pick up the yellow block to place it on top of the red block.\n\n6. Subsequently, we will pick up the blue block and stack it on top of the yellow block, which now sits on the red block.\n\n7.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the blue block on top of the red block, the orange block on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block on top of the blue block, we need to follow a logical sequence of actions based on the initial conditions and the restrictions provided.\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current setup:\n- The yellow block is clear.\n- The hand is empty.\n- The red block is on top of the orange block.\n- The orange block is on top of the blue block.\n- The yellow block is on top of the red block.\n- The blue block is on the table.\n\nFrom this setup, we observe that:\n1. To place the blue block on top of the red block, we need to first remove the yellow block from the red block because the yellow block is currently blocking access to the red block.\n2. Once the yellow block is removed, we can then unstack the red block from the orange block to move it to the desired position.\n3. Next, we need to unstack the orange block from the blue block in order to place the blue block on top of the red block.\n4. Finally, we will need to stack the yellow block back on top of the blue block and then the orange block on top of the yellow block in order to finish the required stacking arrangement.\n\nNow, we can execute the plan step-by-step:\n1. (unstack yellow red) - Remove the yellow block from the top of the red block.\n2. (put-down yellow) - Put the yellow block down, so it is clear again.\n3. (unstack red orange) - Remove the red block from the top of the orange block.\n4. (put-down red) - Put the red block down on the table.\n5. (unstack orange blue) - Remove the orange block from the top of the blue block.\n6. (put-down orange) - Put the orange block down so it\u2019s clear.\n7. (pick-up blue) - Pick up the blue block.\n8. (stack blue red) - Stack the blue block on top of the red block.\n9. (pick-up yellow) - Pick up the yellow block again.\n10. (stack yellow blue) - Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n11. (pick-up orange) - Pick up the orange block.\n12.

The orange block is currently on top of the red block.\n2. **(put-down orange)**: This is possible since I can put the orange block down since my hand is empty and the orange block is clear.\n3. **(unstack blue yellow)**: This involves unstacking the blue block from the yellow block. The blue block is on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is clear, so this is possible.\n4. **(stack blue orange)**: This involves stacking the blue block on the orange block. Since I am holding the blue block and the orange block is clear after the previous actions, this is also possible.\n5. **(pick-up red)**: This involves picking up the red block from the table, which is possible as the hand is empty and the red block is clear.\n6. **(stack red yellow)**: This involves stacking the now held red block on top of the yellow block. The yellow block is clear, so this is possible.\n\n### Time Calculation for Proposed Actions:\n1. Unstack blue from yellow (1 minute)\n2. Put down blue (1 minute)\n3. Unstack orange from red (not feasible initially)\n4. Put down orange (1 minute)\n5. Unstack blue from yellow (1 minute)\n6. Stack blue on orange (1 minute)\n7. Pick up red (1 minute)\n8. Stack red on yellow (1 minute)\n\nIn total, this amounts to 1 minute for each step, but I see my errors in the sequence, as I need to ensure the operations flow well with the constraints.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the blue block and the blue block on top of the orange block, we need to follow the rules about stacking and unstacking blocks carefully.\n\n1. The initial setup has the red block on top of the yellow block, the orange block on top of the red block, and the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n2. The blue block is on the table and is clear, but we cannot directly place the red block on it yet because the blue block is currently under the yellow block.\n3. First, we need to unstack the orange block from the red block, which is on top of the orange, requiring us to temporarily put down the red block on the table.\n4. After successfully putting down the orange block, we can unstack the red block from the yellow block.\n5. Next, we put down the red block on the table.\n6. Now the yellow block will be unstacked from the blue block so that we can free the blue block.\n7. After unstacking the yellow block, we put it down.\n8. We can then pick up the blue block and stack it on the orange block.\n9.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the orange block and the orange block on top of the blue block, we need to analyze the current arrangement of the blocks and the required actions.\n\nCurrently, we have:\n- Red block on top of the orange block.\n- Blue block on top of the yellow block.\n- Orange and yellow blocks on the table.\n- The blue block is clear.\n\nThe goal arrangement requires:\n1. Orange block must be on top of the blue block.\n2. Red block must remain on top of the orange block.\n\nThe steps in the provided plan need careful execution based on the constraints and available actions:\n\n1. **Unstack the Red Block from Orange Block**: Since the red block is currently on the orange block and is not clear, we can unstack it. This takes 1 minute.\n2. **Put Down the Red Block**: After unstacking, we need to put the red block down, which takes another minute. Now the red block is on the table, and we are free to pick it up or do other actions.\n3. **Pick Up the Orange Block**: At this point, the orange block is clear since it is not under anything, allowing us to pick it up. This also takes 1 minute.\n4. **Stack the Orange Block on the Blue Block**: The blue block is clear, permitting us to stack the orange block on top of it. This action also takes 1 minute.\n5. **Pick Up the Red Block**: Now we need to pick up the red block once again, which takes 1 minute.\n6. **Stack the Red Block on the Orange Block**: Finally, we stack the red block on the new stack of the orange block on the blue block. This takes 1 minute.\n\nCalculating the total time for these actions:\n1. Unstack red from orange: 1 minute\n2. Put down red: 1 minute\n3. Pick up orange: 1 minute\n4. Stack orange on blue: 1 minute\n5. Pick up red: 1 minute\n6. Stack red on orange: 1 minute\n\nTotal time = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 minutes.\n\nThe provided plan seems to confirm this sequence efficiently while adhering to the constraints.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the orange block is on top of the red block and the yellow block is on top of the orange block, the following steps must be considered based on the current conditions and constraints:\n\n1. The blue block is currently on top of the orange block, blocking it from being stacked on the red block. \n2. The yellow block is on top of the red block, which means it must be removed first to access the red block.\n3. The goal state is to have the orange block on the red block, which requires unstacking the yellow block from the red block, placing the yellow block down, then unstacking the blue block from the orange block, putting that down, unstacking the orange block, and finally stacking it on the red block. The last steps involve picking up the yellow block and stacking it on top of the orange block.\n\nFollowing these logical deductions, here is the breakdown of the plan:\n\n1. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block** (makes blue clear to manipulate next).\n2. **Put down the blue block** (the blue block is placed down, hand empty again).\n3. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block** (to access the red block below).\n4. **Put down the yellow block** (now the red block is clear).\n5. **Pick up the orange block** (after putting down the yellow, we can now pick up orange).\n6. **Stack the orange block on top of the red block** (achieves part of goal as orange sits on red now).\n7. **Pick up the yellow block again** (now we need to move it to the newly placed orange).\n8. **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block** (finalizes the goal condition).\n\nThis results in the following concise plan:\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack yellow red)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(stack yellow orange)",

Unstack the orange block from red - this will take 1 minute. \n2. Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block - this will take 1 minute. \n3. Unstack the red block from yellow - this will take 1 minute.\n4. Put down the red block - this will take 1 minute.\n5. Unstack the orange block from blue - this is unnecessary since it\u2019s already on yellow; hence ignored.\n6. Stack the orange block on yellow - this action is already completed.\n7. Pick up the blue block - this will take 1 minute.\n8. Stack the blue block on orange - this will take 1 minute.\n\nThese actions lead to the desired configuration. The unnecessary unstacking action of the orange block from blue can be ignored, reducing action complexity.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange red)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)",
        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the blue block on top of the orange block and the orange block on top of the yellow block, we need to consider the current state of the blocks and the actions available to us.\n\n1. The red block is currently on top of the yellow block and cannot be stacked on the orange block until it is unstacked.\n2. The orange block is on top of the red block, meaning we need to unstack the orange block first to clear the red block.\n3. After ensuring the orange block and red block are managed correctly, we can stack the blocks in the correct order to achieve the goal.\n\nFollowing the plan you provided:\n\n1. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the red block** - This makes the red block clear and allows us to pick it up later.\n2. **Stack the orange block on the blue block** - Now the orange block is on top of the blue block.\n3. **Unstack the red block from the yellow block** - We will put the red block down to make it clear.\n4. **Put down the red block** - Red block is now on the table.\n5. **Unstack the orange block from the blue block** - This allows us to stack the orange block on the yellow block.\n6. **Stack the orange block on the yellow block** - Now, the orange block is correctly placed on the yellow block.\n7. **Pick up the blue block** - We need to stack the blue block on the orange block next.\n8. **Stack the blue block on the orange block** - Now the blue block is correctly placed on the orange block.\n\nThrough these steps, we complete the arrangement in 8 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange red)\n(stack orange blue)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of arranging the blocks with the blue block on top of the red block, the orange block on top of the blue block, and the yellow block on top of the orange block, we need to consider the initial conditions and how to manipulate the blocks step by step while adhering to the restrictions.\n\n1. The red block is on top of the blue block and is not clear because the blue block is beneath it.\n2. The first step will be to unstack the red block from the blue block. This will take 1 minute.\n3. After unstacking, we need to put the red block down. This takes an additional minute, totaling 2 minutes so far.\n4. Next, we need to unstack the blue block from the orange block. Since the blue block is currently held in hand (after unstacking the red block), we will unstack the blue block from the orange block. This step takes another minute, reaching 3 minutes in total.\n5. Now, we stack the blue block on top of the red block. This takes another minute, totaling 4 minutes.\n6. Next, we need to pick up the orange block, which takes 1 minute, bringing us to 5 minutes in total.\n7. We stack the orange block on top of the blue block, adding another minute and bringing the total to 6 minutes.\n8. Finally, we pick up the yellow block and stack it on top of the orange block, which takes another minute, culminating in a total of 7 minutes.\n\nHowever, after reevaluating the order, we realize we could optimize this plan. Instead of unstacking the blue from orange, we could unstack red and then directly manipulate the blocks more efficiently.\n\nHere is the optimized plan:\n1. Unstack the red block from the blue block (1 min).\n2. Put down the red block (1 min).\n3. Unstack the blue block from the orange block (1 min).\n4. Stack the blue block on top of the red block (1 min).\n5. Pick up the orange block (1 min).\n6. Stack the orange block on top of the blue block (1 min).\n7. Pick up the yellow block (1 min).\n8. Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block (1 min).\n\nEach step has been executed sequentially ensuring that the blocks maintain a clear state according to the rules provided.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the orange block on top of the blue block and the yellow block on top of the orange block, we need to rearrange the current stack configuration. Starting with the following arrangement:\n\n- red block (clear)\n- blue block (on top of red block)\n- yellow block (on top of blue block)\n- orange block (on top of yellow block)\n\nOur intended end state is:\n\n- blue block (on top of red block)\n- orange block (on top of blue block)\n- yellow block (on top of orange block)\n\n**Steps to analyze:**\n\n1. First, we need to unstack the red block from the blue block, making blue clear so that we can manipulate the blocks further.\n2. Once we have the red block down, we can proceed to unstack the blue block from the yellow block to free up the yellow block.\n3. We will then need to put down the blue block to be able to rearrange the yellow and orange blocks.\n4. Next, we can unstack the yellow block from the orange block and put it down on the now free red block.\n5. After this, we pick up the orange block and stack it on the blue block.\n6.
