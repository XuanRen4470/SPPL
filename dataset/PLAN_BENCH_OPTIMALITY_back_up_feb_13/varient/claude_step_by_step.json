To achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the orange block, we need to remove all blocks above the orange block and then place the red block on it.\n\n3. We start by unstacking the red block from the yellow block, as it's the topmost block and is clear.\n\n4. After unstacking, we need to put down the red block to free our hand.\n\n5. Next, we unstack the yellow block from the blue block.\n\n6. We put down the yellow block to free our hand again.\n\n7. Now we unstack the blue block from the orange block.\n\n8. We put down the blue block, leaving the orange block clear on the table.\n\n9. With the orange block clear, we can now pick up the red block.\n\n10.

To achieve the goal state (red on yellow, blue on red, yellow on orange), we need to rearrange the blocks completely.\n\n3. First, we need to free up the red and yellow blocks. This means we must unstack the orange block from the red block.\n\n4. After unstacking orange from red, we need to put orange down on the table to free our hand.\n\n5. Now we can unstack the red block from the yellow block.\n\n6. We want the blue block at the top of the stack, so we'll stack the red block on the blue block temporarily.\n\n7.

        "answer": "Step-by-step inference:\n\n1. The initial state has orange on top of blue, which is on top of yellow. Red is on the table.\n\n2. To achieve the goal, we need red on yellow, and orange on red.\n\n3. We can't directly move red onto yellow because yellow is not clear.\n\n4. We need to clear yellow first by removing the blocks on top of it.\n\n5. The topmost block is orange, so we start by unstacking orange from blue.\n\n6. After unstacking orange, we need to put it down to free our hand.\n\n7. Now blue is the top block, so we unstack blue from yellow.\n\n8. We put down blue to free our hand again.\n\n9. Now yellow is clear, and we can proceed with the goal state construction.\n\n10. We pick up red from the table.\n\n11. We stack red on top of yellow as per the goal.\n\n12.

To achieve the goal state of red on orange, blue on yellow, and orange on blue, we need to completely rearrange the blocks.\n\n3. We start by unstacking red from yellow, as it's the topmost block and needs to be moved.\n\n4. After putting down red, we unstack yellow from orange and put it down.\n\n5. Next, we unstack orange from blue to free up the blue block.\n\n6. We stack orange on red temporarily to clear the table.\n\n7. Now we can pick up blue and stack it on yellow, achieving one part of our goal state.\n\n8. We then unstack orange from red to prepare for the next step.\n\n9. Orange is stacked on blue, achieving another part of the goal state.\n\n10. Finally, we pick up red and stack it on orange to complete the goal state.\n\n11.

        "answer": "Step 1: Analyze the initial conditions\n- Yellow block is clear and on top of the orange block\n- Orange block is on top of the blue block\n- Blue block is on top of the red block\n- Red block is on the table\n- Hand is empty\n\nStep 2: Identify the goal\n- Orange block needs to be on top of the yellow block\n\nStep 3: Determine the necessary actions\n1. We need to move the yellow block first as it's blocking the orange block\n2. We need to unstack the orange block from the blue block\n3. We need to stack the orange block on top of the yellow block\n\nStep 4: Develop the plan\n1. Unstack the yellow block from the orange block\n2. Put down the yellow block on the table\n3. Unstack the orange block from the blue block\n4. Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block\n\nStep 5: Verify the plan\n- This plan achieves the goal with minimal steps\n- It follows all the given restrictions and rules\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(stack orange yellow)",
