        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE\n\n- Initial conditions: \n  - Red block is clear\n  - Yellow block is clear\n  - Hand is empty\n  - Red block is on top of the blue block\n  - Yellow block is on top of the orange block\n  - Blue block is on the table\n  - Orange block is on the table\n\n- Goal: Orange block must be on top of the red block.\n\n1. Since the yellow block is on top of the orange block, and the orange block cannot be picked up or moved while it's not clear, the first step should be to unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block. This makes the orange block clear.\n\n2. After unstacking, the yellow block is being held. The next action is to put down the yellow block, making the hand empty and allowing the orange block to be picked up.\n\n3. Now that the orange block is clear and the hand is empty, the orange block can be picked up.\n\n4. To achieve the goal, the orange block should be stacked on top of the red block. Since the red block is clear (it's on top of the blue block and no other blocks are on top of it), we can stack the orange block directly onto the red block.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)",

        "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to achieve the goal where the red block is on top of the orange block and the yellow block is on top of the red block, starting from the given initial conditions. Below is my thought process broken down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition Evaluation:**\n    - Blue block is on top of the orange block, which is on top of the yellow block, which is on top of the red block, and the red block is on the table.\n    - Goal: Red block needs to be on top of the orange block, and the yellow block needs to be on top of the red block.\n\n2. **Unstack Blue from Orange:**\n    - First, we have to clear the orange block to eventually place the red block on it. \n    - **Action**: Unstack the blue block from the orange block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n3. **Put Down Blue:**\n    - Once the blue block is unstacked, we need to place it on the table to free our hand.\n    - **Action**: Put down the blue block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n4. **Unstack Orange from Yellow:**\n    - Now, the goal is to clear the yellow block.\n    - **Action**: Unstack the orange block from the yellow block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n5. **Put Down Orange:**\n    - Again, place the orange block on the table to free our hand.\n    - **Action**: Put down the orange block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n6. **Unstack Yellow from Red:**\n    - The yellow block needs to be moved to complete the goal. \n    - **Action**: Unstack the yellow block from the red block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n7. **Stack Yellow on Blue:**\n    - Temporarily place the yellow block on the blue block to free the red block.\n    - **Action**: Stack the yellow block on the blue block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n8. **Pick Up Red:**\n    - Now that the red block is clear, we pick it up.\n    - **Action**: Pick up the red block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n9. **Stack Red on Orange:**\n    - We achieve part of the goal by placing the red block on top of the orange block.\n    - **Action**: Stack the red block on the orange block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n10. **Unstack Yellow from Blue:**\n    - We need to pick up the yellow block to place on the red block.\n    - **Action**: Unstack the yellow block from the blue block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n11. **Stack Yellow on Red:**\n    - Finish the goal by stacking the yellow block on top of the red block.\n    - **Action**: Stack the yellow block on the red block. This takes 1 minute.\n\nThe total time for the plan is 11 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack yellow red)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(stack yellow red)",

To do this, we need to unstack and reposition the blocks as follows:\n\n- **Unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block:** This action clears the red block, assuming it is clear, and leaves the yellow block clear.\n- **Put down the red block:** This action requires putting the red block temporarily aside on the table.\n- **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block:** The yellow block is now clear after moving the red block, so unstack it from the blue block.\n- **Put down the yellow block:** Place the yellow block on the table to clear the blue block.\n- **Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block:** The blue block is now clear after moving the yellow block, so unstack it.\n- **Put down the blue block:** Place the blue block on the table, leaving the orange block clear.\n- **Pick up the red block:** With the red block clear and on the table, it is now picked up.\n- **Stack the red block on top of the orange block:** Finally, stack the red block onto the now-clear orange block.\n\nThis sequence of actions achieves the goal of having the red block on top of the orange block with minimal actions, considering direct manipulation and requirements for clearing blocks.\n\nFinal Answer: ((unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)\n)",

The blue block is on top of the orange block, and the other blocks (red, orange, and yellow) are on the table.\n\n- Objective: To stack the blocks such that the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is on top of the orange block.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Unstack blue from orange**: Since blue is clear and on top of orange, we can unstack blue, freeing up orange.\n   \n   (Result: blue is held, orange is clear)\n\n2. **Stack blue on red**: Stack the held blue block onto the clear red block.\n   \n   (Result: red is now not clear, blue block on red block, hand is empty)\n\n3. **Pick up yellow**: Pick up the clear yellow block from the table.\n\n   (Result: yellow is held)\n\n4. **Stack yellow on orange**: Stack the yellow block onto the clear orange block.\n\n   (Result: orange is not clear, yellow block on orange block, hand is empty)\n\n5. **Unstack blue from red**: Unstack blue from red. Since the red is not clear due to the blue block on top of it as per intermediate steps (it is not physically clear, but as per stated steps, we assume this instruction was reached independently).\n\n   (Result: blue is held)\n\n6. **Stack blue on yellow**: Stack the blue block onto the clear yellow block.\n\n   (Result: yellow is not clear, blue block on yellow block, hand is empty)\n\n7. **Pick up red**: Pick up the clear red block from the table.\n\n   (Result: red is held)\n\n8. **Stack red on blue**: Stack the red block onto the clear blue block, completing the desired stack sequence.\n\n   (Result: red, blue, yellow, orange stacked, hand is empty)\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(unstack blue red)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)",

This takes 1 minute.\n\n2. **Put down Yellow:** After unstacking, the hand holds Yellow. We put Yellow down to make the hand empty again. This takes 1 minute.\n\n3. **Unstack Red from Orange:** Unstack Red from the top of Orange, which is also clear now. This takes 1 minute.\n\n4. **Put down Red:** Put down the Red block to make the hand empty. This takes 1 minute.\n\n5. **Pick up Blue:** Blue is initially on the table and clear, so it can be picked up. This takes 1 minute.\n\n6. **Stack Blue on Yellow:** After picking up the Blue block, it can be stacked on top of the clear Yellow. This takes 1 minute.\n\n7. **Pick up Yellow:** Yellow (now with Blue on top of it) is the next focal point but needs to be picked up first. This takes 1 minute.\n\n8. **Stack Yellow on Red:** Stack Yellow on top of the Red block. The Yellow block is free to be placed since Red is clear on the table.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal given the initial conditions, we'll follow the specific actions allowed and consider the order to minimize time. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Unstack the red block** from on top of the blue block. This operation clears the blue block and allows the red block to be moved. Time: 1 minute.\n\n2. **Put down the red block** on the table since we need to handle other blocks to rearrange them into the desired configuration. Time: 1 minute.\n\n3. **Unstack the blue block** from on top of the yellow block. Now, the yellow block is clear and can be moved. Time: 1 minute.\n\n4. **Put down the blue block** on the table. This action prepares the way for stacking the yellow block on top of it. Time: 1 minute.\n\n5. **Unstack the yellow block** from on top of the orange block. The orange block is now clear and can also be manipulated. Time: 1 minute.\n\n6. **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block**. This partially completes the goal state where the yellow needs to be on the blue. Time: 1 minute.\n\n7. **Pick up the orange block** from the table, as it is clear now, to position it appropriately. Time: 1 minute.\n\n8. **Stack the orange block on top of the red block**. This completes the other part of the goal where the orange is on top of the red. Time: 1 minute.\n\nOur plan uses each action allowed effectively while ensuring blocks are manipulated only when clear, as rules dictate. The completed stack order matches the goal state: orange on red, yellow on blue, the hand is empty.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)",

        "answer": "In this blocks world scenario, we want to move the blue block to the top of the yellow block. The initial conditions are such that the orange and yellow blocks are clear, the hand is empty, and the yellow block is on top of the blue block, which is on top of the red block, with the red and orange blocks on the table.\n\nTo achieve our goal, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block**: Since the yellow block is clear and the hand is empty, we can unstack it. This takes 1 minute.\n2. **Put down the yellow block**: After unstacking the yellow block, we are holding it, so we can put it down, making our hand empty again. This takes another 1 minute.\n3. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the red block**: With an empty hand and the blue block now being clear (since the yellow block was moved), we can unstack the blue block from the red block. This takes 1 minute.\n4. **Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block**: Finally, while holding the blue block, we can stack it on top of the yellow block since the yellow block is clear on the table.

        "answer": "In this task, we need to achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the orange block and the yellow block on top of the red block, starting from the initial conditions. Here's how we can infer the correct sequence of actions:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions:**\n   - The blue block is clear and on top of the yellow block.\n   - The orange block is clear and on top of the red block (red is on the table).\n   - The hand is empty.\n   - The goal is to have the red on top of the orange and the yellow on top of the red.\n\n2. **Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n   - **Unstack the orange block from on top of the red block:** Since the orange block is clear, we can unstack it. This will leave the red block clear, which is necessary for stacking it later.\n   \n   - **Put down the orange block on the table:** To free the hand, we put down the orange block.\n\n   - **Pick up the red block:** With the hand empty, pick up the red block, which is now clear.\n   \n   - **Stack the red block on top of the orange block:** This completes the part of the goal where the red is on top of the orange.\n\n   - **Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block:** The blue block is clear, so we can unstack it to clear the yellow block.\n\n   - **Put down the blue block on the table:** This frees up the hand to manipulate the yellow block.\n   \n   - **Pick up the yellow block:** Now that the blue block is put down, and the yellow block is clear, we can pick up the yellow block.\n   \n   - **Stack the yellow block on top of the red block:** This achieves the final arrangement with the yellow block on top of the red block.\n\nFollowing these steps minimizes the time taken to achieve the goal.

We can achieve this by following these steps:\n\n1. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block:** This will take 1 minute.\n2. **Stack the blue block on top of the red block:** After unstacking the blue block, it is now clear and can be stacked onto the clear red block. This will take an additional 1 minute.\n3. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block:** This step frees up the orange block by removing the yellow block, taking 1 minute.\n4. **Put down the yellow block:** Since we can't hold the yellow block while dealing with the orange block, we put it down, taking 1 more minute.\n5. **Pick up the orange block:** The orange block is now free to be picked up, taking 1 minute.\n6. **Stack the orange block on top of the blue block:** Now we can complete the goal by placing the orange block on the clear blue block, taking the final 1 minute.\n\nThe entire sequence consists of six actions, and each takes 1 minute, totaling 6 minutes to complete the plan.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue yellow) (stack blue red) (unstack yellow orange) (put-down yellow) (pick-up orange) (stack orange blue)",

Put down the yellow block on the table to free up the hand.\n   - Time: 1 minute\n\n3. Unstack the red block from the orange block in order to place the orange block correctly later.\n   - Time: 1 minute\n\n4. Put down the red block temporarily to keep the hand free.\n   - Time: 1 minute\n\n5. Pick up the orange block from the table so it can be placed correctly on the yellow block.\n   - Time: 1 minute\n\n6. Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block, which is part of the final goal configuration.\n   - Time: 1 minute\n\n7. Pick up the blue block, which is clear, from the table so that it can be placed on the orange block.\n   - Time: 1 minute\n\n8. Stack the blue block on top of the orange block, bringing us closer to the final configuration.\n   - Time: 1 minute\n\n9. Finally, pick up the red block and place it on top of the blue block, achieving the goal state.\n   - Time: 1 minute\n\nThe total time taken for these actions is 9 minutes.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the yellow block on top of the red block, we start from the initial condition where the red block is clear, and the hand is empty. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Unstack the Red Block**: The red block is currently on top of the blue block. We unstack the red block from the blue block, which takes 1 minute. Our hand is now holding the red block.\n   \n2. **Put Down the Red Block**: Now that we are holding the red block, we put it down on the table, making it clear. This takes 1 minute.\n\n3. **Unstack the Blue Block**: With our hand empty again, we now unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block, which takes 1 minute. Our hand is holding the blue block.\n   \n4. **Put Down the Blue Block**: We put down the blue block on the table, which takes 1 minute. The blue block becomes clear, and our hand is empty.\n\n5. **Unstack the Yellow Block**: Next, we unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block, freeing it up and making our hand hold the yellow block. This takes another minute.\n\n6. **Stack the Yellow Block on Red Block**: Finally, while holding the yellow block, we stack it on top of the clear red block, achieving the goal. This operation takes 1 minute.\n\nFollowing this plan takes a total of 6 operations, each taking 1 minute, resulting in a total time of 6 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow red)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal, we need to rearrange the blocks following the restrictions provided. Let's analyze the steps:\n\n1. Initially, the blue block is on top of the orange block, which is on top of the yellow block. The red block is clear and on the table. The hand is empty.\n\n2. We need to place the yellow block on the orange block, the red block on the yellow block, and the blue block on top of the red block while ensuring all actions follow the defined restrictions.\n\n3. To do this, first, we need the yellow block to be clear so that we can place it correctly on the orange block.\n\n4. Unstack the blue block from the orange block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n5. Put down the blue block on the table, ensuring it remains clear. This takes another minute.\n\n6. Next, unstack the orange block from the yellow block so that the yellow block is clear. This takes 1 minute.\n\n7. Put down the orange block so that it is on the table and clear. This takes 1 minute.\n\n8. Next, pick up the yellow block, which is now clear and place it on top of the orange block as required. This takes 1 minute for pickup and 1 minute for stacking.\n\n9.

Since the blue block is already on top of the red block, we do not need to move these blocks. Thus, we do not waste time manipulating the blue and red blocks further.\n2. Currently, the orange block is on top of the yellow block. Our goal specifies that the yellow must be on top of the orange, so we need to reverse their positions.\n\nSteps to achieve the goal:\n- First, we should unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block. This frees the yellow block so it can later be moved on top of the orange block. Time taken: 1 minute.\n- Next, put down the orange block onto the table. This frees our hand and makes room on the yellow block for stacking. Time taken: 1 minute.\n- Pick up the yellow block. Time taken: 1 minute.\n- Finally, stack the yellow block on top of the orange block. This completes our goal arrangement.

This will take 1 minute.\n\n6. **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block** - We are holding the yellow block, and since the blue block is now on top of the red, it's also clear. We stack the yellow block on the blue. This will take 1 minute.\n\n7. **Pick up the orange block** - Return to the table to pick up the orange block, which is clear. This will take 1 minute.\n\n8. **Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block** - Now that we are holding the orange block, we stack it on the yellow block. The yellow block is on the blue, and is clear. This will ensure the orange block is on top of the yellow.

Now the red block is no longer clear, and the blue block is on top of it. This takes 1 minute.\n5. **(pick-up yellow):** The yellow block is on the table and clear, so we pick it up into our hand. This takes 1 minute.\n6. **(stack yellow orange):** We stack the yellow block on top of the orange block, achieving the second part of our goal. The orange block is no longer clear, and we are now done. This takes 1 minute.\n\nTotal time = 6 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)",

The time taken is 1 minute.\n   \n2. **Put down the orange block** - After putting the orange block down, it is clear, and the hand is empty again. The time taken is 1 minute.\n\n3. **Unstack the red block from on top of the blue block** - The red block is now held, and the blue block is clear. This takes 1 minute.\n\n4. **Put down the red block** - The red block is placed on the table, making the hand empty. This action also takes 1 minute.\n\n5. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block** - You hold the blue block, and the yellow block becomes clear. This takes 1 minute.\n\n6. **Stack the blue block on top of the red block** - The red block is chosen to provide stability for the blue block temporarily. This action takes 1 minute.\n\n7. **Pick up the yellow block** - The yellow block is picked up from the table, for stacking later. This takes 1 minute.\n\n8. **Stack the yellow block on the orange block** - The yellow block is stacked onto the orange block to satisfy the final condition where it is below the blue block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n9. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the red block** - The blue block is held again for final stacking, taking another 1 minute.\n\n10. **Stack the blue block on the yellow block** - Finally, stack the blue block on top of the yellow block.

        "answer": "We need to achieve the goal where the red block is on top of the orange block and the blue block is on top of the red block, starting from the initial conditions where the blue block is on top of the orange block, and the yellow block is on top of the red block. Followed by a breakdown of the steps below:\n\n1. **Unstack Yellow from Red:**\n   - The yellow block is clear and on top of the red block, which allows us to unstack it. This takes 1 minute.\n\n2. **Put Down Yellow:**\n   - Once we have unstacked the yellow block, we hold it in the hand. We put it down to clear the hand. This takes 1 minute.\n\n3. **Unstack Blue from Orange:**\n   - Now, the blue block is clear and on top of the orange block. Unstack the blue block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n4. **Stack Blue on Yellow:**\n   - Our hand is holding the blue block, and the yellow block is clear since it is on the table. Stack blue on yellow. This takes 1 minute.\n\n5. **Pick Up Red:**\n   - The red block is clear since we unstacked the yellow block from it earlier. Pick up the red block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n6. **Stack Red on Orange:**\n   - Our hand is holding the red block. The orange block is clear on the table. Stack the red block on the orange block. This takes 1 minute.\n   \n7. **Unstack Blue from Yellow:**\n   - The blue block is on top of the yellow block and is clear. Unstack the blue block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n8. **Stack Blue on Red:**\n   - Our hand is holding the blue block. The red block is on top of the orange block, which is clear. Stack the blue block on top of the red block. This takes 1 minute.\n\nFollowing these steps achieves the goal where the red block is on top of the orange block, and the blue block is on top of the red block. The sequence respects all constraints and minimizes time by using 8 steps, each taking 1 minute, totaling 8 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow red)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(stack blue red)",

Unstack it to clear the path for the orange block:\n   - (unstack blue orange): The blue block is now removed from the top of the orange block. Time taken: 1 minute.\n\n6. Put down the blue block so your hand is free to pick up the orange block:\n   - (put-down blue): The blue block is now on the table. Time taken: 1 minute.\n\n7.

Now, with the orange block clear, unstack the orange block from the blue block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n6. Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block. This will take another 1 minute. Now the orange block is no longer clear.\n\n7. Pick up the blue block from the table. This takes 1 minute.\n\n8. Finally, stack the blue block on top of the orange block. This takes 1 minute, completing the final configuration where the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is on top of the red block.\n\nThe entire process involves a careful sequence of actions that ensures the blocks are moved according to the rules and restrictions given, and each step takes 1 minute. The entire plan execution totals 8 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)",

Both blue and orange blocks are on the table. The red and yellow blocks are clear.\n\n2. **Action 1:** Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block. This requires 1 minute.\n\n3. **Action 2:** Put down the yellow block. My hand becomes empty. This takes 1 minute.\n\n4. **Action 3:** Unstack the red block from on top of the blue block. Now the red block is in my hand, and the blue block becomes clear. This takes 1 minute.\n\n5. **Action 4:** Stack the red block on top of the yellow block. After this step, the red block is no longer clear, but the yellow block is on the table and clear. This takes 1 minute.\n\n6. **Action 5:** Pick up the orange block. With this action, the orange block is in my hand, and it was clear before picking it up. This takes 1 minute.\n\n7. **Action 6:** Stack the orange block on top of the red block. After performing this action, the orange block is no longer clear. The red block is also not clear because the orange block is now on top of it. This takes 1 minute.\n\n8. **Action 7:** Pick up the blue block. The blue block can be picked up since it is clear and on the table. This takes 1 minute.\n\n9. **Action 8:** Stack the blue block on top of the orange block. Now the blue block is no longer clear, and the orange block is also not clear.

The hand is empty.\n   Goal: The blue block should end up on top of the red block.\n\n2. Actions:\n   1. Unstack the yellow block from the blue block: The yellow block is currently on top of the blue block and is clear, so it can be unstacked. This takes 1 minute.\n\n   2. Put down the yellow block: Now that the yellow block has been picked up, it can be put down on the table. This takes 1 minute.\n\n   3. Unstack the blue block from the orange block: With the yellow block out of the way, the blue block is now clear and can be unstacked from the orange block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n   4. Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block: The blue block can be temporarily stacked on top of the yellow block, which is now on the table and clear. This takes 1 minute.\n\n   5. Unstack the orange block from the red block: The orange block is now clear, and we need to move it to eventually place the blue block on the red block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n   6. Put down the orange block: After unstacking, the orange block is held and can be put down on the table, thus clearing the red block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n   7. Unstack the blue block from the yellow block: The blue block is clear and can be moved for its final placement. This takes 1 minute.\n\n   8.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the blue block on top of the red block, the orange block on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block on top of the blue block, we need the following steps:\n\n1. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block.** This action is necessary because I need to move both the orange and yellow blocks, and the orange block currently obstructs access to the yellow block and the blue block under it. This action takes 1 minute. The orange block becomes in hand, and the blue block is clear.\n\n2. **Put down the orange block on the table.** I must place the orange block somewhere to free up my hand, and the table is the only available option right now. This takes 1 minute. The orange block is now on the table, and my hand is empty.\n\n3. **Pick up the yellow block.** I want to stack the yellow block on top of the blue block first, so I need to pick it up. The yellow block is currently clear and on the table, so it's available for this action. It takes 1 minute to pick up the yellow block.\n\n4. **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.** I can now place the yellow block onto the blue block, as both are clear and my hand is holding the yellow block. This action also takes 1 minute. The blue block is no longer clear, and the yellow block is on top of it.\n\n5. **Pick up the orange block again.** I intend to stack the orange block on top of the yellow block, so I need to pick it up. This takes 1 minute, resulting in the orange block being in hand.\n\n6. **Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block.** With the orange block in hand and the yellow block clear, I can stack the orange block onto the yellow block.

        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to rearrange the blocks such that the red block is on top of the orange block and the blue block is on top of the red block. Here's the step-by-step inference using the given conditions and constraints:\n\n1. The red block is currently on top of the yellow block, which is on top of the blue block. The blue block is on top of the orange block, and the orange block is on the table.\n\n2. We want the red block to end up on top of the orange block and the blue block on top of the red block.\n\nLet's proceed with the plan:\n\n- **unstack red from yellow**: First, we unstack the red block from the yellow block. This takes 1 minute, and we'll hold the red block.\n\n- **put down red block**: Put the red block on the table to free the hand and also make the yellow block clear. This takes 1 minute.\n\n- **unstack yellow from blue**: Next, unstack the yellow block from the blue block. This takes 1 minute, and we'll hold the yellow block.\n\n- **put down yellow block**: Put down the yellow block on the table to free the hand. This takes 1 minute.\n\n- **unstack blue from orange**: Then, unstack the blue block from the orange block. This takes 1 minute, and we'll hold the blue block.\n\n- **stack blue onto yellow**: Temporarily stack the blue block onto the yellow block to make the orange block clear. This takes 1 minute.\n\n- **pick up red block**: Pick up the red block, which is on the table. This takes 1 minute.\n\n- **stack red onto orange**: Stack the red block onto the clear orange block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n- **unstack blue from yellow**: Unstack the blue block from the yellow block.

Blue block on top of the red block.\n2. Orange block on top of the blue block.\n\nSteps and reasoning:\n1. **Unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block**: \n   - Since the red block is clear and the hand is empty, we can unstack it from the yellow block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n2. **Put down the red block**:\n   - Now that we are holding the red block, we can put it down onto the table. This clears our hand and takes 1 minute.\n\n3. **Pick up the blue block**:\n   - With the hand empty and the blue block being clear on the table, we pick up the blue block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n4. **Stack the blue block on top of the red block**:\n   - Now that we're holding the blue block, we can stack it on top of the red block, which is on the table. This action takes 1 minute.\n\n5. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block**:\n   - The yellow block becomes clear after the red block is removed. We unstack it from the orange block, which takes 1 minute.\n\n6. **Put down the yellow block**:\n   - After unstacking, we put the yellow block down on the table. This action clears our hand and takes 1 minute.\n\n7. **Pick up the orange block**:\n   - With the hand empty and the orange block being clear (since the yellow is removed), we pick up the orange block.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal with minimal time, we need to consider the steps to rearrange the blocks from their initial state to the desired final state. The initial condition is that the blue block is on top of the yellow block, and both the red and orange blocks are on the table with all blocks being clear except for the yellow block. We need the red block on top of the yellow block, with the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n\nSteps to achieve the desired configuration:\n\n1. **Unstack the blue block from the yellow block:** This makes the yellow block clear and allows us to stack other blocks on it.\n\n2. **Put down the blue block:** This frees up our hand to pick up other blocks.\n\n3. **Pick up the yellow block:** Now that it is clear, we can pick it up to stack on top of the blue block.\n\n4. **Stack yellow block on top of the blue block:** This satisfies part of the goal\u2019s condition where the yellow block is on top of the blue block.\n\n5. **Pick up the red block:** Now that the yellow block is partway into the goal position, we can move the red block.\n\n6. **Stack the red block on top of the yellow block:** This final action completes the formation of the goal since the red block is on top of the yellow block, which is now on top of the blue block.\n\nTotal time for each action (1 minute per action) results in 6 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red yellow)",

        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE\n\nTo solve the problem and achieve the goal state, we start with the given initial conditions and perform the following actions step by step:\n\n1. The initial state has the red block on top of the blue block and the yellow block on top of the red block, with both the blue and orange blocks on the table. The orange block is clear.\n\n2. We need to get the yellow block to its final position on top of the red block. To do this, we first unstack the yellow block from the red block.\n\n3. After unstacking, we put down the yellow block, which frees the red block for manipulation.\n\n4. Next, we unstack the red block from the blue block since we eventually need to place the red block on top of the orange block.\n\n5. We put the red block on the yellow block temporarily by stacking it on top, which sets up for later operations.\n\n6. We then pick up the orange block, making it ready for stacking operations.\n\n7. Next, we stack the orange block on top of the blue block, thereby achieving one part of our goal state where the orange block is on the blue block.\n\n8. We unstack the red block from the yellow block to move it to its final position on top of the orange block.\n\n9. We then stack the red block on top of the orange block, achieving the state where the red block is on the orange block.\n\n10.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the yellow block on top of the blue block, starting with the provided initial conditions, the following steps and inferences are made, considering the actions allowed and the need to minimize time:\n\n1. **Identify the Initial State and Goal:**\n   - Initial: Blue on red, red on table, orange on table, yellow on table.\n   - Goal: Yellow on top of blue.\n\n2. **Determine Necessary Actions:**\n   - The blue block is currently not clear as it is sitting on top of the red block.\n   - In order to put the yellow block on top of the blue, no other block should be on top of blue, however, blue is currently on red. So we will directly stack yellow on blue.\n   - The yellow block is clear and on the table, which allows picking it up directly.\n\n3. **Plan Execution:**\n   - The hand is currently empty, and the yellow block is clear and on the table, so we can directly pick up the yellow block.\n   - With the yellow block picked up, we can stack it directly on the blue block, completing the goal.\n\n**Total Time Cost:**\n   - Picking up the yellow block: 1 minute.\n   - Stacking the yellow block on the blue block: 1 minute.\n\nThe above actions lead us to achieve the goal with the minimum possible actions and time, utilizing only 2 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the blue block, I will analyze the initial conditions and derive a sequence of actions that accomplishes this goal in the minimal time. \n\nInitially, the conditions are:\n- The orange block is clear and on top of the red block.\n- The yellow block is clear and on top of the blue block.\n- The hand is empty.\n- The red block is on the table.\n- The blue block is on the table.\n\nThe goal condition is:\n- The red block is on top of the blue block.\n\nTo achieve this, we need to clear the path so the red block can be placed on top of the blue block.

Plan Steps:\n   - **Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block.** This action takes 1 minute, leaving the blue block in your hand and the orange block clear.\n\n   - **Put down the blue block on the table.** This takes another minute. Now, the blue block is on the table and your hand is empty.\n\n   - **Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block.** This takes 1 minute, leaving the orange block in your hand and the yellow block clear.\n\n   - **Put down the orange block on the table.** This takes 1 minute.

This makes the red block clear, allowing us to move it into position later.\n\n   - **Step 2**: Pick up the red block and stack it on top of the blue block, aligning with our goal where the red needs to be on the blue.\n\n   - **Step 3**: Unstack the yellow block from the orange block as the yellow block needs to be on top of the red block, and the orange needs to be on top of the yellow. Then stack the yellow block on top of the red block.\n\n   - **Step 4**: Finally, pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the yellow block because the yellow is now on top of the red, satisfying all conditions of our goal.\n\n4. **Total Time**: Each action takes one minute, so the total plan would take 7 actions or 7 minutes.\n\n**Plan Execution**:\n\n- Unstack the blue block from the red block.\n- Put down the blue block.\n- Pick up the red block.\n- Stack the red block on top of the blue block.\n- Unstack the yellow block from the orange block.\n- Stack the yellow block on top of the red block.\n- Pick up the orange block.\n- Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the yellow block and the blue block on top of the orange block, we must first consider the initial conditions and then plan the necessary steps while minimizing the time taken.\n\n**Initial Conditions:**\n- Orange block is clear.\n- Hand is empty.\n- Red block is on top of the yellow block.\n- Blue block is on top of the red block.\n- Orange block is on top of the blue block.\n- Yellow block is on the table.\n\n**Goal:**\n- Red block on top of the yellow block.\n- Blue block on top of the orange block.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Currently, the red block is already on top of the yellow block, so this part of the goal is achieved.\n- We need the blue block to be on top of the orange block. Currently, the blue block is underneath the orange block, so we need to swap their positions.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n\n1. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block:** \n   - The orange block is currently on top of the blue block. Since the orange block is clear, we can unstack it.\n   - This action takes 1 minute.\n\n2. **Put down the orange block:** \n   - After unstacking, we need to put down the orange block to free our hand.\n   - This action takes 1 minute.\n\n3. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the red block:** \n   - Now the blue block is clear, since we removed the orange block. We can unstack it from the red block.\n   - This action takes 1 minute.\n\n4. **Stack the blue block on top of the orange block:**\n   - Finally, we achieve the goal by stacking the blue block onto the orange block.\n   - This action takes 1 minute.\n\nThus, these steps achieve our goal in the minimum time.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack blue red)\n(stack blue orange)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the orange block on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block on top of the red block, while minimizing time and adhering to the rules provided, we can follow these detailed steps:\n\n1. **Initial setup**: \n   - Orange block is clear.\n   - Red block is on top of the yellow block.\n   - Blue block is on top of the red block.\n   - Orange block is on top of the blue block.\n   - Yellow block is on the table.\n   - Hand is empty.\n\n2. **Plan Execution**:\n\n   - **Unstack orange from blue**: Since the orange block is clear and the hand is empty, we can unstack the orange block from the blue block. This takes 1 minute.\n   \n   - **Put down orange**: With the orange block in hand, we put it down. This takes another minute, making it 2 minutes in total.\n\n   - **Unstack blue from red**: Now with the hand empty and the blue block clear, we unstack the blue block from the red block. This takes another minute, accumulating to 3 minutes total.\n\n   - **Put down blue**: While holding the blue block, we put it down. Another minute passes, bringing us to 4 minutes total.\n\n   - **Unstack red from yellow**: With the hand empty again, and the red block now clear, we unstack the red block from the yellow block. This step takes 1 minute, totaling 5 minutes.\n\n   - **Put down red**: We then put down the red block, which takes another minute, bringing the total to 6 minutes.\n\n   - **Pick up yellow**: With the hand empty, we pick up the yellow block. This action requires 1 minute, making it 7 minutes in total.\n\n   - **Stack yellow on red**: The yellow block is held and the red block is clear on the table. We stack the yellow block on top of the red block. This takes an additional minute, totaling 8 minutes.\n\n   - **Pick up orange**: Moving forward, we pick up the orange block since the hand is empty and the orange block is clear, which requires 1 minute, bringing us to 9 minutes.\n\n   - **Stack orange on yellow**: Finally, we stack the orange block on top of the yellow block, which requires another minute, making the total time 10 minutes.\n\nBy following these steps, we achieve the desired configuration while meeting all constraints and minimizing time.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)",

This takes 1 minute.\n\n2. **Put Down the Orange Block:** Since you're holding the orange block, put it down. This takes another 1 minute.\n\n3. **Unstack the Yellow Block from the Blue Block:** The yellow block is now clear, so unstack it from the blue block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n4. **Stack the Yellow Block on Top of the Orange Block:** Now stack the yellow block on top of the orange block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n5. **Unstack the Blue Block From the Red Block:** The blue block is on top and can be unstacked. This takes 1 minute.\n\n6. **Put Down the Blue Block:** Put down the blue block; this action will take another minute.\n\n7. **Unstack the Yellow Block from the Orange Block:** Once again, the yellow block is clear, so unstack it from the orange block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n8. **Stack the Yellow Block on Top of the Red Block:** Stack the yellow block on top of the red block as required by the goal condition. This takes 1 minute.\n\n9. **Pick Up the Blue Block:** Now, pick up the blue block. This action takes 1 minute.\n\n10. **Stack the Blue Block on Top of the Yellow Block:** Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block aligned with the goal. This takes 1 minute.\n\n11. **Pick Up the Orange Block:** Pick up the orange block, requiring 1 minute.\n\n12. **Stack the Orange Block on Top of the Blue Block:** Finally, stack the orange block on top of the blue block to meet the goal conditions.

Initially, the blue block is on the red block, and the orange block is on the yellow block. \n\n3. To place the red block on top of the blue block, we first need to remove the blue block from the red block by unstacking it. This will make the red block clear.\n\n4. After unstacking the blue block, we need to put it down, as we need to pick up the red block afterward. This will set the blue block on the table, cleared for future stacking if needed.\n\n5. Next, we pick up the red block. \n\n6. We then stack the red block on top of the blue block, which aligns with part of our final goal configuration.\n\n7.

You are now holding the yellow block, and the red block is clear.\n\n4. **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block**\n   - The orange block is clear. Stack the yellow block (which you are holding) on top of the orange block. Now the yellow block is not clear, but the hand is empty again.\n\n5. **Pick up the blue block**\n   - With the hand empty and the blue block clear, pick up the blue block to move it.\n\n6. **Stack the blue block on top of the red block**\n   - The red block is clear on the table. Stack the blue block (which you are holding) on top of the red block.

Initial condition: All blocks are on the table and clear, and the hand is empty. Therefore, we can initially move any block we desire.\n\n2. Step 1: Pick up the blue block from the table. \n   - This takes 1 minute and results in the blue block being held in the hand.\n\n3. Step 2: Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block. \n   - Since the yellow block is on the table and clear, we can stack the blue block onto it.\n   - This takes 1 minute.\n\n4. Step 3: Pick up the red block from the table.\n   - This takes 1 minute and results in the red block being held in the hand.\n\n5. Step 4: Stack the red block on top of the blue block.\n   - The blue block is now on top of the yellow block and clear, so we can stack the red block onto it.\n   - This takes 1 minute.\n\n6. Step 5: Pick up the orange block from the table.\n   - This takes 1 minute and results in the orange block being held in the hand.\n\n7. Step 6: Stack the orange block on top of the red block.\n   - The red block is currently on top of the blue block and clear, so we can stack the orange block onto it.\n   - This takes 1 minute.\n\nAfter these steps, we have achieved the desired configuration with the red block on the blue block, the blue block on the yellow block, and the orange block on the red block, within a total time of 6 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)",

This action takes 1 minute.\n\n3. **Pick up the red block:** Next, we pick up the red block from the table to stack it on top of the blue block. This action takes 1 minute.\n\n4. **Stack the red block on top of the blue block:** We now stack the red block onto the blue block. This action takes 1 minute.

        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE\n\nTo achieve the goal state, let's evaluate the steps:\n\n1. The initial condition is that the yellow block is on top of the red block. To make the red block clear so that it can be moved on top of the orange block, we need to first unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n2. Next, we put down the yellow block on the table to free up our hand. This takes another 1 minute.\n\n3. Now that the hand is empty and the orange block is clear, we pick up the orange block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n4. We then stack the orange block on top of the yellow block. This consumes another minute.\n\n5. With the orange block now on the yellow block, and the red block on the table and clear because we moved the yellow earlier, we pick up the red block. This task takes 1 minute.\n\n6. We then stack the red block on top of the orange block. This stacking task takes 1 minute.\n\n7. Next, we need to move the blue block. We pick up the blue block from the table, spending 1 minute on this action.\n\n8. Finally, we stack the blue block on top of the red block, which takes 1 minute.\n\nThe total time taken for this plan is 8 minutes. This sequence achieves the desired ending configuration efficiently by utilizing legal moves and minimizing redundant actions.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack yellow red)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue red)",

        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE\n\n1. Given the initial conditions, the first step is to make the yellow block clear to enable rearrangement. Since the blue block is on top of the yellow block and the blue block is clear, we can unstack the blue block from the top of the yellow block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n2. Now, we need to position the blue block according to the goal. We stack the blue block on top of the red block because it is clear. This takes another 1 minute.\n\n3. To achieve the final configuration, we need to start building the foundation from the table up. The next step is to move the orange block onto the yellow block, as specified in the desired configuration. We pick up the orange block, which is clear, from the table. This takes 1 minute.\n\n4. Next, we stack the orange block on top of the yellow block. This takes another 1 minute.\n\n5. To finalize the configuration, we need to stack the red block on top of the blue block and ensure all blocks are correctly aligned. First, we need to remove the blue block from the top of the red block by unstacking it. This takes 1 minute.\n\n6. Then, we stack the blue block onto the orange block because the orange block is clear. This move aligns the blue block with the desired stack configuration. This takes another 1 minute.\n\n7. We pick up the red block as it's now clear and on the table and stack it on top of the blue block. This ensures the final goal state is achieved with the red block sitting on top of the blue block, which is on top of the orange block sitting on top of the yellow block. Picking up the red block takes 1 minute.\n\n8. Finally, stacking the red block on top of the blue block completes the desired stack.

Here is a step-by-step inference for the plan:\n\n1. The blue block is on top of the yellow block. To reach the goal where the yellow block is on top of the blue block, we first need to free the yellow block from its position under the blue block.\n\n2. Begin by unstacking the blue block from on top of the yellow block. \n   - This takes 1 minute. \n   - Now the blue block is in hand, and the yellow block is clear.\n\n3. Next, put down the blue block. \n   - This clears the hand and places the blue block on the table.\n   - The hand is now empty again, and the yellow block is clear with the orange block on the table.\n\n4. Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block. \n   - This takes 1 minute. \n   - Now the yellow block is in hand, and the orange block is clear.\n\n5. Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block. \n   - This takes 1 minute. \n   - The yellow block is now on the blue block, making it not clear. \n   - The blue block is no longer clear since it has the yellow block on top of it.\n   - The hand is now empty. \n\n6. Lastly, for the goal condition `the orange block is on top of the red block`, pick up the orange block. \n   - This takes 1 minute. \n   - The hand now holds the orange block.\n\n7. Stack the orange block on top of the red block. \n   - This takes 1 minute. \n   - The orange block is now on top of the red block. \n   - The red block is no longer clear since it has the orange block on top of it.\n   - The hand becomes empty again.\n\nThe sequence is complete in 6 minutes and meets all the goal conditions.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)",

        "answer": "To solve the block stacking problem, we need to reach the final goal state by performing valid actions while minimizing the time taken. The initial setup and restrictions give us the following situational analysis and action planning:\n\n1. **Initial Condition Analysis:**\n   - The yellow block is initially on top of the orange block, and the orange block is on top of the blue block.\n   - The red block is clear and on the table, and the blue block is clear and on the table.\n\n2. **Goal States:**\n   - The blue block should be on top of the orange block.\n   - The yellow block should be on top of the red block.\n\n3. **Planning Steps & Inference:**\n   - The yellow block needs to be moved from the orange block and placed on top of the red block. This can be done by unstacking yellow from orange and then stacking yellow onto red.\n   - The orange block, which is under yellow and above blue initially, needs to be clear to move the blue block. Thus, unstack orange from blue, and place the orange block down on the table to free the blue block.\n   - Then, pick up the blue block and put it onto the orange block to achieve the desired stack order for blue.\n\n4. **Actions:**\n   - Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block (takes 1 minute).\n   - Stack the yellow block on top of the red block (takes 1 minute).\n   - Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block (takes 1 minute).\n   - Put down the orange block on the table (takes 1 minute).\n   - Pick up the blue block (takes 1 minute).\n   - Stack the blue block on top of the orange block (takes 1 minute).\n\nEach action takes 1 minute, and the correct sequence of actions should achieve the goal state in minimal time.\n\nFinal Answer: \n```\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow red)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)\n```",

        "answer": "To solve the problem, we need to arrange the blocks according to the specified goal. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to achieve this:\n\n1. **Initial conditions**: \n    - Orange is clear.\n    - Red is on top of blue.\n    - Orange is on top of yellow.\n    - Yellow is on top of red.\n    - Blue is on the table.\n\n2. **Goal**: \n    - Blue block on top of orange block.\n    - Orange block on top of red block.\n\n3. **Plan**:\n   - Start by addressing the relationship between the orange, yellow, and red blocks. Currently, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, which is on top of the red block. The blue block must eventually be on top of the orange block. Our first step is to clear the orange block and make it free to move.\n\n4. **Steps**:\n   - **Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block.** Since the orange block is initially clear, we can unstack it.\n   - **Put down the orange block on the table.** We now have our hands free again.\n   - **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block.** Now that the orange block is no longer on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is clear and can be unstacked.\n   - **Put down the yellow block on the table.** This action gives us more freedom and clears the red block.\n   - **Unstack the red block from on top of the blue block.** With the yellow block put down, the red block becomes clear. We unstack it.\n   - **Put down the red block on the table.** The red block will serve as our support for the orange block.\n   - **Pick up the orange block.** From its resting place on the table, we can now use it in our stacking process.\n   - **Stack the orange block on top of the red block.** This achieves part of our goal.\n   - **Pick up the blue block.** Finally, we pick up the blue block from the table, ready to stack it.\n   - **Stack the blue block on top of the orange block.** This completes the goal of having the blue block on top of the orange block, which is already on top of the red block.\n\nEach of these actions takes 1 minute, and the plan is efficient given the constraints.\n\nFinal Answer: ((unstack orange yellow) (put-down orange) (unstack yellow red) (put-down yellow) (unstack red blue) (put-down red) (pick-up orange) (stack orange red) (pick-up blue) (stack blue orange))",

        "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to rearrange the blocks according to the goal while following the actions and constraints. Let's start by analyzing the given initial conditions and the desired final arrangement:\n\nInitial Conditions:\n1. Blue block is clear, and it's on top of the orange block.\n2. The hand is empty.\n3. The red block is on top of the yellow block.\n4. The yellow block is on the table.\n5. The orange block is on top of the red block.\n\nGoal Conditions:\n1. The blue block is on top of the orange block.\n2. The yellow block is on top of the blue block.\n\nSteps:\n1. **Clear the Path for Repositioning:**\n   - Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block. This allows the blue block to be moved.\n\n2. **Move the Blue Block Aside:**\n   - Put down the blue block somewhere else on the table to free up the orange block.\n\n3. **Access the Red Block:**\n   - Unstack the orange block from on top of the red block.\n\n4. **Reposition the Orange Block:**\n   - Put down the orange block somewhere else on the table to free up the red block.\n\n5. **Prepare the Blue Block to be Stacked Properly:**\n   - Pick up the blue block.\n\n6. **Re-stack the Blue Block:**\n   - Stack the blue block on top of the orange block.\n\n7. **Free the Yellow Block:**\n   - Unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block.\n\n8. **Move the Red Block Aside:**\n   - Put down the red block on the table.\n\n9. **Position the Yellow Block:**\n   - Pick up the yellow block.\n\n10. **Final Goal Achievement:**\n    - Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n\nEach action respects the rules regarding when a block is clear and when the hand is empty. The sequence ensures minimal moves and adheres to the constraints given for picking, putting, stacking, and unstacking blocks.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack orange red)\n(put-down orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the yellow block and the blue block on top of the red block, we need to follow these steps according to the rules and initial conditions:\n\n1. **Unstack Blue from Red:** Currently, the blue block is on top of the red block, and the blue block is clear. We can unstack the blue block from the red block first to make the red block clear and available to be picked up. This action takes 1 minute and involves holding the blue block.\n\n2. **Put Down Blue:** After unstacking it, we put down the blue block on the table. By placing it down, our hand becomes free to pick up other blocks. This action takes 1 minute.\n\n3. **Pick Up Red:** With the red block now clear (since the blue block has been unstacked from it), we pick up the red block. This action takes 1 minute.\n\n4. **Stack Red on Yellow:** With the red block picked up, and since the yellow block is currently on top of the orange block and is clear, we stack the red block on top of the yellow block as needed for the goal. This action takes 1 minute.\n\n5. **Pick Up Blue:** Once the red block is on the yellow block, the next step is to pick up the blue block (which had been put down earlier on the table and is clear). This action takes 1 minute.\n\n6. **Stack Blue on Red:** Finally, with the blue block picked up, we stack it on top of the red block (which is already on top of yelllow as needed). This action takes 1 minute.\n\nOverall, the process takes 6 actions, totaling 6 minutes, respecting all restrictions and achieving the desired final arrangement.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\n(unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue red)\n```",

(1 minute)\n\n5. **Pick up orange**: Pick up the orange block from the table for the next stacking action. (1 minute)\n\n6. **Stack orange on yellow**: Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block, as desired in the final configuration.

        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE\n\nTo achieve the goal starting from the initial conditions, we follow these logical steps:\n\n1. **Unstack blue from yellow:** The blue block is clear, and it's necessary to remove it to access the yellow block underneath.\n2. **Put down blue:** Once blue is unstacked, it should be put down to free up the hand.\n3. **Unstack yellow from red:** Now that the blue block is out of the way, unstack the yellow block from the red block to make the yellow block accessible for rearrangement.\n4. **Stack yellow on blue:** With the yellow block now free, stack yellow on the blue block. The blue block is already put down and is clear.\n5. **Unstack red from orange:** Freeing up the red block requires unstacking it from the orange block.\n6. **Put down red:** Place it on the table so you can handle it later when forming the desired structure.\n7. **Unstack yellow from blue:** Rearranging further requires unstacking yellow from blue so they can be correctly ordered.\n8. **Stack yellow on red:** Arrange yellow on red according to the goal.\n9. **Pick up blue:** The goal is to stack blue on yellow, so pick up the blue block.\n10. **Stack blue on yellow:** Arrange blue on yellow, which is already on red.\n11. **Pick up orange:** The final step is to place the orange block.\n12. **Stack orange on blue:** Complete the stack by placing orange on blue.\n\nThis sequence adjusts the blocks to match the desired final order by managing each move efficiently.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack yellow red)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)",

The time taken is 1 minute.\n2. **Stack yellow on red:** The red block is clear on the table, so we can stack yellow on it. The time taken is 1 minute.\n3. **Pick up the blue block:** Blue is on the table and clear, so we can pick it up. The time taken is 1 minute.\n4. **Stack blue on orange:** The orange block is clear, so blue can be stacked on it. The time taken is 1 minute.\n5. **Unstack yellow from red:** Unstack yellow from red, ensuring the setup allows us to proceed to the next sequence. The time taken is 1 minute.\n6. **Stack yellow on blue:** Now blue is on orange, so we can stack yellow on blue. The time taken is 1 minute.\n7. **Pick up the red block:** Red, which is on the table, can be picked up.

This takes 1 minute.\n5. **Unstack orange from blue**: Orange is clear, and the hand is empty, permitting us to unstack orange from blue. This takes 1 minute.\n6. **Put down orange onto the table**: Holding orange, we put it down on the table. This takes 1 minute.\n7. **Pick up blue**: Blue is on the table and clear, so we can pick it up. This requires the hand to be empty. This takes 1 minute.\n8. **Stack blue on red**: Red is clear on the table, and the hand is holding blue, so we stack blue on red. This takes 1 minute.\n9. **Pick up yellow**: Yellow is clear on the table after having been put down earlier, so we pick it up. This requires the hand to be empty. This takes 1 minute.\n10. **Stack yellow on blue**: With blue now part of a stack on red, yellow can be stacked on top of blue as blue is clear. This takes 1 minute.\n11. **Pick up orange**: Orange is still clear on the table, so we pick it up. The hand needs to be empty to do this.

The red block is on top of the blue block, so this aligns with the goal:\n     - **(stack yellow red)**: Stack the yellow block on top of the red block.\n\n   - Pick up the orange block again, as it needs to be placed on top of the yellow block:\n     - **(pick-up orange)**: Pick up the orange block.\n\n   - Finally, stack the orange block on top of the yellow block to complete the goal arrangement:\n     - **(stack orange yellow)**: Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block.\n\nThis sequence of actions achieves the desired goal configuration.

Initially, the orange block is on top of the red block, which is on the blue block, and the blue block is on the yellow block. The orange block is clear, meaning it can be unstacked first.\n\n2. To move the orange block to its desired location on top of the blue block, I first need to make sure the blue block is clear. However, since the current configuration has the red block between the orange and blue, this implies the red must be moved first to clear the blue.\n\n3. Start by unstacking the orange block from the red block to access the red block directly.\n\n4. Put down the orange block to ensure both the hand is free and the red block becomes clear.\n\n5. Now, unstack the red block from the blue block since the red is clear and the hand is free.\n\n6. Put down the red block to make it a base for the final required configuration above the orange block later.\n\n7. Pick up the orange block again to start positioning it in its final location.\n\n8. Stack the orange block on top of the blue block, which is clear now since the red was unstacked from it.\n\n9. Pick up the previously put down red block, which is now available on the table.\n\n10. Finally, stack the red block on top of the orange block, completing the goal configuration.\n\nThe necessary sequence of actions accounting for clear conditions and hand availability adherence, while achieving the goal optimally, is detailed. \n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack orange red)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)",

The initial configuration places the red block on the yellow block, the orange block on the blue block, and the yellow block on the orange block, with the blue block on the table.\n\n2. To achieve the desired configuration, we need the red block on top of the blue block, the blue block on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block on top of the orange block.\n\n3. The current setup creates a cycle that must be broken down to achieve a clear stack. \n\n4. Start by unstacking the red block from the yellow block, since it's a clear block and our ultimate goal is to place the red block on top of the blue.\n\n5. Once the red block is unstacked, put it down on the table to free your hand.\n\n6. Next, unstack the yellow block from the orange block. This frees up the yellow block, which needs to eventually go on top of the orange block.\n\n7. Stack the yellow block onto the red block, which is currently on the table. This temporarily keeps the yellow block out of the way as it's needed later.\n\n8. Then unstack the orange block from the blue block, making the blue block the base of our desired configuration.\n\n9. Place the orange block down to clear your hand and proceed with other operations.\n\n10. Unstack the yellow block from the red block. The yellow block will need to be placed on the orange block to form part of the new stack.\n\n11.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the blue block and the orange block on top of the red block, I will work through the steps logically, considering the constraints of block manipulation.\n\n1. The initial state has the red block, yellow block, and blue block clear. The blue block is on top of the orange block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, and the red block is on the table. The blue and orange blocks are both on the table.\n\n2. To free the blue block, which is needed to stack things correctly, we must unstack it from the orange block. So, the first step is:\n   - (unstack blue orange) [1 minute]\n   \n3. We need to place the blue block on the table to free our hand:\n   - (put-down blue) [1 minute]\n\n4. The next step is to free the red block so that we can stack the red block on the blue block later. The yellow block is on top of the red block, therefore, we need to:\n   - (unstack yellow red) [1 minute]\n\n5. Put down the yellow block on the table to free our hand:\n   - (put-down yellow) [1 minute]\n\n6. Now, with the red block clear and the blue block free and clear, pick up the red block:\n   - (pick-up red) [1 minute]\n\n7. And stack the red block onto the blue block:\n   - (stack red blue) [1 minute]\n\n8. Finally, we need to move the orange block and place it on top of the red block. So, first pick up the orange block:\n   - (pick-up orange) [1 minute]\n\n9. Stack the orange block on top of the red block:\n   - (stack orange red) [1 minute]\n\nThese steps ensure that all constraints are met, and the goal state is achieved in the minimum total time.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack yellow red)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)",

Unstack the blue block from the yellow block. (Unstacking requires the blue block to be clear, which it is.)\n2. Put down the blue block on the table (to clear the hand).\n3. Pick up the yellow block (which is now clear).\n4. Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block (achieving part of the desired goal configuration).\n5. Unstack the orange block from the red block (orange is clear).\n6. Put down the orange block on the table (to clear the hand).\n7. Pick up the red block (now clear) from the table.\n8. Stack the red block on top of the yellow block (accomplishing another part of the goal).\n9. Pick up the orange block (which was put down, and is now clear).\n10.

(This makes yellow and blue blocks individually clear.)\n   - **Step 2:** Stack yellow block on top of the red block. (Temporarily stack yellow to free orange for positioning later.)\n   - **Step 3:** Pick up the orange block. (Clear step, since orange is clear and independent on the table.)\n   - **Step 4:** Stack orange block on top of the blue block. (Achieves the goal for orange and blue.)\n   - **Step 5:** Unstack yellow block from on top of the red block. (Clears the temporary arrangement for yellow.)\n   - **Step 6:** Stack yellow block on top of the orange block. (Position yellow correctly over orange.)\n   - **Step 7:** Pick up the red block.

        "answer": "Given the initial state and the goal, let's deconstruct this step-by-step:\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- Red block is clear.\n- Yellow block is clear.\n- Hand is empty.\n- Red block is on top of the blue block.\n- Blue block is on top of the orange block.\n- Orange block is on the table.\n- Yellow block is on the table.\n\nGoal:\n- Blue block is on top of the red block.\n- Orange block is on top of the blue block.\n- Yellow block is on top of the orange block.\n\nSteps to Reach the Goal:\n\n1. **Unstack the Red Block from the Blue Block:**\n   - The red block is clear and can be unstacked from the blue block. This takes 1 minute.\n   \n2. **Put Down the Red Block:**\n   - Once the red block is held, we put it down somewhere on the table. This takes 1 minute.\n\n3. **Unstack the Blue Block from the Orange Block:**\n   - The hand is empty now, and since the blue block is clear after red is removed, we can unstack it from the orange block. This takes 1 minute.\n\n4. **Stack the Blue Block on the Red Block:**\n   - We now want to place the blue block on the red block to match the goal. This gets the first part of our goal, blue on red. This takes 1 minute.\n\n5. **Pick Up the Orange Block:**\n   - The orange block is now clear as the blue block was unstacked. Our hand is empty after completing the previous stack operation, so we can pick up the orange block to position it next. This takes 1 minute.\n\n6. **Stack the Orange Block on the Blue Block:**\n   - After we have picked up the orange block, we need to place it on the blue block to achieve part of our goal. The blue block is clear after step 4. This takes 1 minute.\n\n7. **Pick Up the Yellow Block:**\n   - The yellow block is clear and on the table, allowing us to pick it up. Our hand is empty after stacking orange on blue. This takes 1 minute.\n\n8. **Stack the Yellow Block on the Orange Block:**\n   - Lastly, we place the yellow block on the orange block. The orange block is clear as a result of our positioning in step 6. This accomplishes the final part of the goal. This takes 1 minute.\n\nThe complete plan that satisfies the goal with minimal time:\n\nFinal Answer: \n((unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange))",

        "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to rearrange the blocks to achieve the goal as efficiently as possible following the stated restrictions on actions.\n\n1. **Initial Conditions:**\n   - Yellow block is clear.\n   - Hand is empty.\n   - Blue block is on top of the red block.\n   - Orange block is on top of the blue block.\n   - Yellow block is on top of the orange block.\n   - Red block is on the table.\n\n2. **Goal:**\n   - Orange block on top of the yellow block.\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - We need to move the orange block to be on top of the yellow one. \n   - The yellow block is currently the topmost and clear, so we start by dealing with the yellow block first.\n\n4. **Steps to Achieve Goal:**\n   - **Unstack** the yellow block from on top of the orange block. (The yellow block is clear and the hand is initially empty, so we can do this.)\n   - **Put down** the yellow block on the table. (After unstacking, we are holding the yellow block, so we need to put it down to clear our hand.)\n   - The orange block is now clear (since we removed the yellow block), so we proceed to unstack it:\n   - **Unstack** the orange block from on top of the blue block.\n   - **Stack** the orange block on top of the yellow block. (The orange block is now being held, and the yellow block is clear after having been put down.)\n\nFollowing these steps will efficiently rearrange the blocks as required to reach our goal, using the minimum possible time of 4 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(stack orange yellow)",
