Next, I unstack the yellow block from the red block and put it down, making the red block clear. I then pick up the red block and stack it onto the orange block. With the red block stacked, I move on to the blue block, which starts clear. I pick up the blue block and stack it onto the red block as required. Lastly, I pick up the yellow block and stack it onto the blue block to complete the goal.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange yellow) (put-down orange) (unstack yellow red) (put-down yellow) (pick-up red) (stack red orange) (pick-up blue) (stack blue red) (pick-up yellow) (stack yellow blue)",

My goal is to position the red block on top of the blue block, the orange block on top of the red block, and the yellow block on top of the orange block. To achieve this, I will follow a series of actions: I start by unstacking the yellow block from the blue block and putting it down, making the blue block clear. Next, I unstack the blue block from the orange block and put it down, clearing the orange block. Then, I unstack the orange block from the red block, making the red block clear. I stack the orange block on the yellow block to temporarily free up the red block. Now, I pick up the red block and stack it on the blue block.

We then put down the blue block. Next, we unstack the orange block from the red block. The orange block must be stacked on the yellow block, since it needs to be on the red block at the goal state, and the yellow block eventually on top of the orange block.

        "answer": "INFERENCE: Initially, the orange and yellow blocks are clear, while the hand is empty. The red block sits atop the blue, the yellow rests on the red, and both the blue and the orange are on the table. The aim is to sequence the blocks such that the blue block is positioned above the yellow, the orange is above the blue, and the yellow sits atop the red without violating the movement restrictions.\n\nFirst, unstack the yellow block from the red, making the yellow block available for subsequent stacking actions. Proceed to stack the yellow on the orange block, thus freeing the red block to be unstacked from the blue. Next, the red block is put down, allowing the unstacking of the yellow block from the orange. To achieve the goal, now stack the yellow on the red. Subsequently, utilize the clear blue block to stack it atop the newly arranged yellow. Finally, pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the blue block, thus completing the desired configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow red) (stack yellow orange) (unstack red blue) (put-down red) (unstack yellow orange) (stack yellow red) (pick-up blue) (stack blue yellow) (pick-up orange) (stack orange blue)",

First, unstack the orange block from the yellow block and put the orange block down. This action clears yellow, enabling the next step. Next, unstack the yellow block from the blue block and stack it on top of the orange block, making orange not clear and moving towards the goal. After that, unstack the blue block from the red block and put it down; this action clears the red block and ensures blue is not obscured by any other block. Then, unstack the yellow block from the orange block and stack it on the red block, achieving that yellow is on red, as part of the goal. Pick up the blue block and stack it on the yellow block, satisfying the requirement that blue is on yellow. Finally, pick up the orange block and stack it on the blue block, thus meeting the condition that orange is on blue.
