Unstack the blue block from on top of the red block: Since the blue block is clear and the hand is empty, we can do this action.\n2. Put down the blue block: After unstacking, our hand won't be empty, so we need to put down the blue block to proceed with other actions.\n3. Unstack the red block from on top of the orange block: Now that the blue block is out of the way, we can unstack the red from the orange.\n4. Stack the red block on top of the blue block: This step is unnecessary as our goal requires the red block to be on the orange block, so we'll omit it.\n5. Pick up the orange block: The orange block is currently on the table, and our hand is empty.\n6. Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block: Since the yellow block is clear and on the table, we can stack the orange on it.\n7. Unstack the red block from on top of the blue block: We correct the misplaced step and focus on placing the red block according to our goal.\n8. Stack the red block on the orange block: Now, we are aligning with the goal stated.\n\nFollowing through the steps and adjustments, here's the valid plan:\n\n1. Unstack blue block from red\n2. Put down the blue block\n3. Unstack red block from orange\n4. Pick up the orange block\n5. Stack orange on yellow\n6.

Thus, we can pick it up.\n   \n4. **Stack the red block on top of the yellow block:** \n   - The yellow block is clear, and since we are holding the red block, we can stack it there, partially achieving our goal by placing the red block on top of the yellow block.\n\n5. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block:** \n   - The orange block is on top of the blue block, is clear, and we can unstack it because the hand becomes empty after stacking the red block.\n\n6. **Stack the orange block on top of the red block:**\n   - Now, we can complete the goal by stacking the orange block on top of the red block, as we are holding the orange block and the red block is clear.\n\n### Justification:\n- Each move follows the constraints of being able to only manipulate one block at a time, ensuring blocks are clear before stacking, and having an empty hand before picking up or unstacking.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange yellow)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red yellow)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(stack orange red)",

Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block: The yellow block is held, and the blue block is clear, so we can stack it there.\n3. Unstack the red block from on top of the orange block: The red block is clear, and we have a free hand by putting down yellow in the previous steps.\n4. Put down the red block: Now, place the red block on the table.\n5. Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block: To prepare for the next step, we need our hand empty, and thus clear the yellow block.\n6. Stack the yellow block on top of the red block: Now, the red block is clear on the table, and the yellow block can be stacked upon it.\n7. Pick up the blue block: With the hand empty and the blue block clear, we can pick it up.\n8. Stack the blue block on top of the orange block: Finally, with the orange block clear, stack the blue block on it.\n\nThese steps ensure we achieve the specified goal while adhering to all rules and restrictions provided in the problem statement.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow red)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)",

The yellow block will then be clear, allowing us to unstack it from the blue block. Let's proceed with a detailed plan to achieve the goal:\n\n1. Unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block: Since the red block is on top and clear, we can safely unstack it.\n2. Put down the red block: This clears it from our hands, allowing further operations.\n3. Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block: The yellow block is now clear.\n4. Stack the yellow block on top of the red block: This helps achieve part of the goal with yellow and red stacking.\n5. Pick up the blue block: With the yellow block moved, the blue block is clear and can be picked.\n6. Stack the blue block on top of the orange block: This satisfies the goal part of blue stacking on top of orange.\n7. Unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block: This preps the yellow block for final stacking.\n8. Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block: Now completes the goal structure with yellow on blue, which is on orange.\n9. Pick up the red block: With yellow finally moved, red becomes clear for final action.\n10. Stack the red block on top of the yellow block: Completion of the desired stack sequence.\n\nBy following these logical steps, the conditions will end up satisfying the goal configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)\n(unstack yellow red)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red yellow)",

Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block: The yellow block is clear and can be unstacked.\n6. Put down the yellow block: This puts the yellow block on the table, freeing up the orange block.\n7. Unstack the blue block from the red block: Moving the blue block back to stack later.\n8.

        "answer": "Let's start by analyzing the initial conditions and the goal.\n\nInitial conditions:\n- The blue block is clear\n- The hand is empty\n- The blue block is on top of the yellow block\n- The orange block is on top of the red block\n- The yellow block is on top of the orange block\n- The red block is on the table\n\nGoal:\n- The red block is on top of the orange block\n- The blue block is on top of the red block\n- The yellow block is on top of the blue block\n\nTo achieve the goal, we can follow this sequence of steps:\n\n1. Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block: Since the blue block is clear and the hand is empty, this action is valid.\n2. Put down the blue block: This action frees the hand for the next pick-up.\n3. Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block: Now that the blue block is out of the way, the yellow block is clear.\n4. Put down the yellow block: Again, this frees the hand.\n5. Unstack the orange block from on top of the red block: The orange block is clear because we just moved the yellow block.\n6. Put down the orange block: This action clears the way for stacking operations.\n7. Pick up the red block: The red block is on the table and clear, so we can pick it up.\n8. Stack the red block on top of the orange block: This action achieves part of the goal.\n9. Pick up the blue block: Now the blue block is on the table and clear again.\n10. Stack the blue block on top of the red block: This achieves another part of the goal.\n11. Pick up the yellow block: The yellow block is now clear on the table.\n12.

        "answer": "Let's go through the problem with the given initial conditions and goal.\n\nInitial conditions:\n\n- Red block is clear\n- Yellow block is clear\n- Hand is empty\n- Blue block is on top of the orange block\n- Yellow block is on top of the blue block\n- Red block is on the table\n- Orange block is on the table\n\nGoal:\n\n- Blue block is on top of the orange block\n- Orange block is on top of the red block\n- Yellow block is on top of the blue block\n\nInference:\n\nGiven the initial conditions, the first appropriate step would be to clear the path for stacking the blocks as per the goal. We proceed with the plan as follows:\n\n1. With the hand empty, unstack the yellow block from the blue block.\n2. With the hand holding the yellow block, put it down to free the hand.\n3. With the hand empty, unstack the blue block from the orange block.\n4. With the goal in mind, stack the blue block onto the yellow block.\n5. With the hand empty again, pick up the orange block.\n6. Now, stack the orange block onto the red block since the red block is on the table.\n7. Unstack the blue block from the yellow block, freeing the blue block.\n8. Stack the blue block onto the previously stacked orange block.\n9. Finally, with the hand empty, pick up the yellow block.\n10. Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n\nThis plan should order the blocks to meet the goal by ensuring each step follows the rules and empty hand logic provided in the problem.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow blue)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(stack blue orange)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)",
