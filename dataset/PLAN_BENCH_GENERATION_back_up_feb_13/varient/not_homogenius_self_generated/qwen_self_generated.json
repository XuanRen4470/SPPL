        "answer": "Initially, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, and the hand is empty. The orange block is on top of the blue block, and the yellow block is on top of the red block. The red block is on the table, and the blue block is on the table. The goal is to move the red block on top of the blue block.\n\nLet's break down the plan step-by-step to achieve this final configuration:\n\n1. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block**: \n   - The orange block is clear, allowing this step.\n   - The hand now holds the orange block.\n\n2. **Put down the orange block**:\n   - Place the orange block back onto the table. \n   - The hand is now empty.\n\n3. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block**:\n   - The yellow block is clear.\n   - The hand now holds the yellow block.\n\n4. **Put down the yellow block**:\n   - Place the yellow block on the table.\n   - The hand is now empty.\n\n5. **Pick up the red block**:\n   - The red block is clear and on the table.\n   - The hand now holds the red block.\n\n6. **Stack the red block on top of the blue block**:\n   - The blue block is clear.\n   - The red block is placed above the blue block.\n   - The hand is now empty.\n\nThe plan is successful, as it aligns with achieving the goal that the red block is on top of the blue block.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack yellow red)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)",
