Next, we need to put the silver block on top of the orange block. The silver block is clear and our hand is empty:\n   - Pick up the silver block.\n   - Stack the silver block on top of the orange block.\n4. Now, the magenta block is placed on top of the silver block. The magenta block is clear and our hand is empty:\n   - Pick up the magenta block.\n   - Stack the magenta block on top of the silver block.\n5. The red block needs to go on top of the magenta block. Our hand is free and the red block is clear:\n   - Pick up the red block.\n   - Stack the red block on top of the magenta block.\n6. Lastly, we need to place the violet block on top of the red block.

        "answer": "Certainly, let's work through the plan based on the goal and initial conditions given:\n\n1. The initial condition states that the cyan block is clear and on the table. According to the goal, the cyan block needs to be on top of the magenta block. Hence, the first action will be to pick up the cyan block and then stack it on the magenta block.\n\n2. Next, since the black block is clear and needs to be on top of the cyan block (which is now on the magenta block), pick up the black block and stack it on top of the cyan block.\n\n3. From the conditions, the green block is initially clear and needs to be on top of the black block. Thus, pick up the green block and stack it on the black block.\n\n4. The yellow block needs to be on top of the green block. So, pick up the yellow block and stack it on the green block.\n\n5. The white block is clear and needs to go on top of the yellow block. Hence, pick up the white block and stack it on the yellow block.\n\n6. The next condition is to have the silver block on top of the white block. So, pick up the silver block and stack it on the white block.\n\n7. The blue block should be on top of the silver block, which is clear. Pick up the blue block and stack it on the silver block.\n\n8. The violet block must be placed on top of the blue block. Consequently, pick up the violet block and stack it on the blue block.\n\n9. Finally, the gold block should be atop the violet block.

Step-by-step Execution:\n   a. **Pick up the silver block**: Available because the silver block is clear and on the table, and my hand is empty.\n   b. **Stack the silver block on top of the black block**: Valid since I'm holding the silver block and the black block is clear.\n   \n   c. **Pick up the yellow block**: Allowed since the yellow block is clear (no blocks on top of it and it's on the table), and my hand is empty.\n   d. **Stack the yellow block on top of the silver block**: Valid since the silver block is now supporting the yellow block and is clear.\n   \n   e. **Pick up the orange block**: Possible because the orange block is clear and on the table, and my hand is available.\n   f. **Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block**: Valid as the yellow block is clear, enabling the orange block to be stacked on it.\n   \n5. Each step progresses toward achieving the goal, taking advantage of the constraints and properties provided initially.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up silver)\n(stack silver black)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow silver)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal as outlined in the problem, we need to stack the blocks in a specific order according to their required end positions. Here's the reasoning based on the initial conditions and the desired stack order:\n\n1. **Blue block**: Needs to be on top of the magenta block. Since the blue block is clear and initially on the table, we first pick up the blue block and then stack it on top of the magenta block, which is also clear.\n\n2. **Orange block**: Needs to be on top of the blue block, which is now on top of the magenta block. The orange block is clear and on the table, so we pick it up and stack it on the blue block.\n\n3. **Green block**: Needs to be on top of the orange block. The green block is clear and on the table, so we pick it up and stack it on the orange block.\n\n4. **White block**: Needs to be on top of the green block. The white block is clear and on the table, so we pick it up and stack it on the green block.\n\n5. **Violet block**: Needs to be on top of the white block. The violet block is clear and on the table, so we pick it up and stack it on the white block.\n\n6. **Red block**: Needs to be on top of the violet block. The red block is clear and on the table, so we pick it up and stack it on the violet block.\n\nFollowing this order will properly achieve the goal state with all blocks positioned correctly according to the initial and constraints provided.\n\nFinal Answer: \n```\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue magenta)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green orange)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white green)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet white)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red violet)\n```",

        "answer": "To achieve the desired final configuration of blocks, we need to follow a sequence of picking up and stacking actions while adhering to the given rules and constraints. We start with all the blocks clear and on the table, and the hand is empty.\n\n1. We need to build two separate stacks that will eventually be combined:\n   - One stack with the sequence: silver, gold, green, cyan, white, blue, red, black, magenta.\n   - Another stack derived from the sequence with the arrangement requirements.\n\n2. Following the stacking order of identifying which blocks can sit on others according to the goal, we notice:\n\n   - The lowest clear stack involves positioning the silver block at the bottom, followed by the gold block, then the green block, following with the cyan block in sequence, done sequentially from bottom up.\n\n   - Another clear stack involves starting with magenta starting at the top, then the black block beneath, red block, blue block and finally white under depending on necessity. This keeps green, silver base stack clear from others when combining objectives.\n\n3. Logical order dictates establishing foundation stacks individually, then moving:\n   - Form mini stack involving (magenta, then black, red, blue, white) enabling base foundation before sidebar sepation.\n   - Form mini stacking (cyan, then green, gold, silver) transitioning finishes anticipated base. \n\n4. Overlaid, ensure that new base stack follows through with combined requirements from stacks, creates requirement: red on blue, blue on white, white on cyan, with magenta stacking over black, black over red, cyan across green, gold cartridge atop base, and gold sitting on silver.\n\nWith this in mind, here are the steps executed in order:\n\nINFERENCE HERE\n\nFinal Answer: \n(pick-up gold)\n(stack gold silver)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green gold)\n(pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan green)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white cyan)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue white)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black red)\n(pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta black)",

This gives us a base to stack the magenta block.\n3. Pick up the magenta block and stack it on the green block, as we need magenta to be on green.\n4. Pick up the black block and stack it on the magenta block to achieve the positioning of black on magenta.\n5. Pick up the red block and stack it on the black block, fulfilling the condition of red on black.\n6. Pick up the yellow block and stack it on the red block, as yellow should be on red.\n7. Pick up the blue block and stack it on the yellow block, with blue needing to be on yellow.\n8. Since violet is next needed on blue, pick up the violet block and stack it on the blue block.\n9. Pick up the white block and stack it on the violet block, which positions white on violet.\n10. The cyan block needs to be on white, so pick it up and stack it on the white block.\n11.

The final configuration indicates that the silver block should be at the bottom, and the red block should be placed on top of it. So, first, we pick up the red block and stack it on the silver block.\n\n2. Next, the yellow block is supposed to be stacked on top of the red block. So, we pick up the yellow block and stack it on the red block.\n\n3. Then, the magenta block needs to be on top of the yellow block. Thus, we pick up the magenta block and stack it on top of the yellow block.\n\n4. Moving to the stack with orange, since the orange block needs to be on top of the magenta block, we pick up the orange block and stack it on the magenta block.\n\n5. Now, we place the black block on top of the orange block, so we pick up the black block and stack it on the orange block.\n\n6. The green block comes next, being stacked on top of the black block. We pick up the green block and stack it on the black block.\n\n7. The final structure requires the gold block on top of the green block. We pick up the gold block and stack it on the green block.\n\n8.

        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE\n\nTo achieve the stated goal with the given actions and constraints, we must create the desired stack configurations as outlined in the statement. We will start by placing the green block on top of the magenta block. As the green block and magenta block are already clear, we perform the actions: pick up the green block and then stack it on the magenta block. Next, the silver block needs to be placed on top of the green block. Given the silver block is clear and on the table, we pick up the silver block and place it on top of the green block. Continuing in this manner, we pick up the white block and stack it on top of the silver block. Then we take the red block and stack it upon the white block. Next, the violet block needs to be placed on top of the red block, so we clear the violet block from the table, pick it up, and stack it onto the red block. Subsequently, we need the black block on the violet block, so we clear and stack it accordingly.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of stacking the blocks in the specified order, we need to follow these steps while adhering to the constraints given. The plan should follow a logical order, ensuring that each block is placed correctly while maintaining the clarity necessary for subsequent actions.\n\n1. First, stack the violet block on top of the yellow block because the violet block needs to be underneath the orange block later in the sequence, and the yellow block needs to stay clear for this action.\n\n   Actions: \n   - Pick up the violet block.\n   - Stack the violet block on top of the yellow block.\n\n2. Next, stack the orange block on top of the violet block. This action places the orange block at the correct location for the final configuration, and the violet-orange configuration starts forming the base for the upper blocks.\n\n   Actions:\n   - Pick up the orange block.\n   - Stack the orange block on top of the violet block.\n\n3. Stack the blue block on top of the orange block. The blue block needs to be between the red and orange blocks in the final stacking.\n\n   Actions:\n   - Pick up the blue block.\n   - Stack the blue block on top of the orange block.\n\n4. Now, stack the red block on top of the blue block. By doing this, we are placing the red block correctly on top of the blue block as per the goal configuration.\n\n   Actions:\n   - Pick up the red block.\n   - Stack the red block on top of the blue block.\n\n5. Stack the white block on top of the red block. The white block must end up on top of the red block in the final configuration.\n\n   Actions:\n   - Pick up the white block.\n   - Stack the white block on top of the red block.\n\n6. Finally, stack the silver block on top of the white block. This completes the stack with the silver block at the topmost position according to the goal.\n\n   Actions:\n   - Pick up the silver block.\n   - Stack the silver block on top of the white block.\n\nThis sequence of actions correctly arranges the blocks into the desired final configuration while respecting the constraints of block manipulation.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(pick-up violet) \n(stack violet yellow) \n(pick-up orange) \n(stack orange violet) \n(pick-up blue) \n(stack blue orange) \n(pick-up red) \n(stack red blue) \n(pick-up white) \n(stack white red) \n(pick-up silver) \n(stack silver white)",

        "answer": "To achieve the desired stack configuration, we need to consider the goal state and the initial conditions, following the actions and restrictions provided. The aim is to transform multiple blocks from their initial positions on the table to a complex stack structure by picking them up and stacking them one by one. The sequence of actions involves making sure each block is clear before picking it up, stacking blocks one on top of another as specified in the goal, and ensuring the hand is empty after each stack action.\n\nHere's the inference that leads to the solution:\n\n1. Start with the magenta block, which needs to be stacked on the green block.\n   - Pick up the magenta block (it is clear).\n   - Stack the magenta block on the green block (the green block is clear).\n\n2. Move to the orange block, which should go on top of the magenta block.\n   - Pick up the orange block (it is clear).\n   - Stack the orange block on the magenta block (the magenta block is clear after the previous step).\n\n3. The yellow block should be on top of the orange block.\n   - Pick up the yellow block (it is clear).\n   - Stack the yellow block on the orange block (the orange block is clear after it gets stacked).\n\n4. Next, stack the silver block on the yellow block.\n   - Pick up the silver block (it is clear).\n   - Stack the silver block on the yellow block.\n\n5. Stack the black block on the silver block.\n   - Pick up the black block (it is clear).\n   - Stack the black block on the silver block.\n\n6. Stack the white block on the black block.\n   - Pick up the white block (it is clear).\n   - Stack the white block on the black block.\n\n7. Stack the red block on the white block.\n   - Pick up the red block (it is clear).\n   - Stack the red block on the white block.\n\n8. The gold block is to be placed on top of the red block.\n   - Pick up the gold block (it is clear).\n   - Stack the gold block on the red block.\n\n9. Next, place the cyan block on top of the gold block.\n   - Pick up the cyan block (it is clear).\n   - Stack the cyan block on the gold block.\n\n10.

Here's the step-by-step inference to achieve the goal, considering the rules:\n\n1. We can pick up the white block because it is clear and on the table.\n2. We then stack the white block on top of the black block. This results in the white block no longer being clear, but the hand becomes empty again.\n3. Next, we pick up the yellow block. Since it is still clear, this action is valid.\n4. We stack the yellow block on top of the white block. As a result, the yellow block is no longer clear.\n5. Moving forward, we pick up the blue block, as it was initially clear and remains so, because we haven't altered its position.\n6. Finally, we stack the blue block on top of the yellow block.

Initially, as all blocks are clear and on the table, the hand is empty, which allows us to begin manipulating the blocks.\n\n2. We need to create two main stacks:\n   - Stack 1: Red on top of Yellow, Yellow on top of Green.\n   - Stack 2: White on top of Silver, Black on top of White, and Silver on top of Red from Stack 1.\n\n3. Start by addressing Stack 1:\n   - Pick up the Yellow block.\n   - Stack the Yellow block on top of the Green block.\n\n4. Next, place the Red block onto the Yellow block:\n   - Pick up the Red block.\n   - Stack the Red block on top of the Yellow block.\n\n5. Begin forming Stack 2 by placing Silver on the Red block:\n   - Pick up the Silver block.\n   - Stack the Silver block on top of the Red block.\n\n6. Proceed with forming the rest of Stack 2:\n   - Pick up the White block.\n   - Stack the White block on top of the Silver block.\n\n7. Finally, place the Black block:\n   - Pick up the Black block.\n   - Stack the Black block on top of the White block.\n\nFollowing these steps ensures the achievement of the specified final block configuration efficiently within the given rules.\n\nFinal Answer: ((pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow green)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red yellow)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver red)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white silver)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black white)\n)",

Now, the blue block is not clear.\n\n3. **Pick up the black block:** The hand is empty, and the black block is clear and on the table, so we can pick it up.\n\n4. **Stack the black block on top of the blue block:** We hold the black block, and since we previously stacked the blue block on the silver block, the blue block is now underneath the black block. We can stack the black block on top of the blue block, which is now clear. The blue block will no longer be clear after this.\n\nBy following these steps, our final configuration matches the goal state, where the blue block is on top of the silver block, and the black block is on top of the blue block.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue silver)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black blue)",

Let's stack the white block on top of the green block as required in the goal state:\n   - Pick up the white block (hand becomes holding white block).\n   - Stack the white block on top of the green block (hand becomes empty).\n   \n2. Next, stack the black block on top of the white block:\n   - Pick up the black block (hand becomes holding black block).\n   - Stack the black block on top of the white block (hand becomes empty).\n\n3. Then stack the red block on top of the black block:\n   - Pick up the red block (hand becomes holding red block).\n   - Stack the red block on top of the black block (hand becomes empty).\n\n4. Now, stack the violet block on top of the red block:\n   - Pick up the violet block (hand becomes holding violet block).\n   - Stack the violet block on top of the red block (hand becomes empty).\n\n5. Finally, stack the silver block on top of the violet block:\n   - Pick up the silver block (hand becomes holding silver block).\n   - Stack the silver block on top of the violet block (hand becomes empty).\n\nNow the final stacked configuration satisfies the goal conditions:\n- The red block is on top of the black block.\n- The white block is on top of the green block.\n- The black block is on top of the white block.\n- The violet block is on top of the red block.\n- The silver block is on top of the violet block.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up white)\n(stack white green)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black white)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red black)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet red)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver violet)",

First, pick up the magenta block and then stack it on the blue block.\n3. Next, the orange block needs to be on top of the magenta block. Pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the magenta block.\n4. The cyan block should go on top of the orange block, so we pick up the cyan block and stack it on the orange block.\n5. The yellow block is to be stacked on top of the cyan block. Pick up the yellow block and stack it on the cyan block.\n6. The green block should be on top of the yellow block, so pick up the green block and stack it on the yellow block.\n7.

        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE\n\nGiven the initial conditions, each block is on the table and clear, meaning none have blocks on top of them. The task is to stack the blocks in a specific order according to the goal state. Here's how the inference might proceed:\n\n1. We need to stack the violet block on the green block. Since violet and green are clear and on the table, we:\n   - (pick-up violet)\n   - (stack violet green)\n\n2. Next, we need to stack the cyan block on the violet block. Violet is no longer clear after the first step as it is stacked on green, but cyan is clear and on the table, so we:\n   - (pick-up cyan)\n   - (stack cyan violet)\n\n3. Then, we need to place the blue block on the cyan block. Cyan is not clear after the previous step because the cyan is on violet, but blue is clear and on the table, so we:\n   - (pick-up blue)\n   - (stack blue cyan)\n\n4. The goal requires us to place the silver block on the blue block. Blue is not clear after being stacked on cyan, but silver is clear and on the table, so we:\n   - (pick-up silver)\n   - (stack silver blue)\n\n5. Now, the yellow block needs to be stacked on the silver block. Silver is not clear after stacking on blue, but yellow is on the table and clear, so we:\n   - (pick-up yellow)\n   - (stack yellow silver)\n\n6. Finally, we need to stack the white block on the yellow block. Yellow is not clear after stacking on silver, but white is clear and on the table, so we:\n   - (pick-up white)\n   - (stack white yellow)\n\nThis process organizes the blocks to match the goal state outlined.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet green)\n(pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan violet)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue cyan)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow silver)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white yellow)",

        "answer": "Based on the initial conditions and the requirements to achieve the final goal, I will break down the steps needed to reach the desired configuration using individual actions subject to the defined restrictions.\n\nInitial conditions provided:\n1. Blue, yellow, magenta, black, and violet blocks are clear and on the table.\n2. The hand is empty.\n\nFinal goal:\n1. Blue block on top of violet block.\n2. Magenta block on top of blue block.\n3. Black block on top of magenta block.\n4. Yellow block on top of black block.\n\nTo achieve these goals, let's outline the necessary steps:\n\n1. Pick up the blue block.\n   - This action can be performed directly as the blue block is clear and the hand is empty.\n\n2. Stack the blue block on top of the violet block.\n   - Violet block is clear, so the blue block can be stacked on it, making the violet no longer clear. \n\n3. Pick up the magenta block.\n   - The magenta block is clear and the hand is empty, so it can be picked up.\n\n4. Stack the magenta block on top of the blue block.\n   - Blue block is now clear since it was stacked, so the magenta block can be stacked on it.\n\n5. Pick up the black block.\n   - The black block is clear and the hand is empty, so it can be picked up.\n\n6. Stack the black block on top of the magenta block.\n   - Magenta block is now clear since it was stacked, allowing the black block to be stacked on it.\n\n7. Pick up the yellow block.\n   - The yellow block is clear and the hand is empty, so it can be picked up.\n\n8. Stack the yellow block on top of the black block.\n   - The black block is now clear since it was stacked, allowing the yellow block to be stacked on it.\n\nThus, these steps achieve the final configuration aimed by the problem statement.

        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE:\n\nGiven the initial conditions and actions you can perform, the method for reaching your goal state involves stacking blocks in steps. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Initial setup**:\n   - Blocks that need to be part of a stack: orange, white, magenta, black, violet, silver.\n   - All blocks are clear and on the table initially.\n\n2. **Plan Construction**:\n   - **Pick-up and Stack Actions**: You can only perform \"pick-up\" on a block that is clear and on the table, and you can only \"stack\" on another block that is clear. This means you need to plan the stacking order carefully:\n\n   - **Step 1**: Stack the block without dependencies first, building from the table.\n     - Pick up the violet block (which is clear).\n     - Stack the violet block on top of the blue block. \n\n   - **Step 2**: Build on the violet stack.\n     - Pick up the black block.\n     - Stack the black block on top of the violet block.\n\n   - **Step 3**: Build on the black stack.\n     - Pick up the orange block.\n     - Stack the orange block on top of the black block.\n\n   - **Step 4**: Start a new independent stack.\n     - Pick up the silver block.\n     - Stack the silver block on top of the orange block.\n\n   - **Step 5**: Stack the remaining blocks similarly.\n     - Pick up the magenta block.\n     - Stack the magenta block on top of the silver block.\n     - Pick up the white block.\n     - Stack the white block on top of the magenta block.\n\nThis will achieve the goal state since each block is stacked on the correct block as per the requirement, maintaining the rules of the clear block at each step.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up violet)  \n(stack violet blue)  \n(pick-up black)  \n(stack black violet)  \n(pick-up orange)  \n(stack orange black)  \n(pick-up silver)  \n(stack silver orange)  \n(pick-up magenta)  \n(stack magenta silver)  \n(pick-up white)  \n(stack white magenta)  ",

        "answer": "To achieve the stated goal, the blocks must be stacked in a specific sequence. Here's the reasoning process for how to place each block, starting from the base block and moving upwards:\n\n1. The **white block** is to be stacked below the **magenta block**. Thus, pick up the white block and stack it on the magenta block's location (without needing to stack magenta yet) to ensure the magenta block ultimately is on top.\n   \n2. **Black block** must be on top of the white block. Thus, pick up the black block and place it on the white block.\n   \n3. The **yellow block** should be stacked on top of the black block. So, pick up the yellow block and place it on the black block.\n   \n4. The **orange block** should stack on top of the yellow block. Pick up the orange block and place it on the yellow block.\n   \n5. The **cyan block** must go on top of the orange block. Pick up the cyan block and stack it there.\n   \n6. **Gold block** goes on top of the cyan block. So, pick up the gold block and stack it on the cyan block.\n   \n7. **Green block** should be on the gold block, so pick it up and stack it there.\n   \n8. **Violet block** must go on top of the green block. Thus, pick it up and stack it on the green block.\n   \n9. The **silver block** needs to be placed on top of the violet block. Pick up the silver block and stack it there.\n   \n10. **Red block** should be stacked on the silver block. Pick it up and place it on top of the silver block.\n   \n11. Finally, place the **blue block** on top of the red block. Pick it up and stack it on the red block.\n\nBy conducting the actions in this sequence, each block will be correctly placed according to the goal configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(pick-up white)\n(stack white magenta)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black white)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow black)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan orange)\n(pick-up gold)\n(stack gold cyan)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green gold)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet green)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver violet)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red silver)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue red)",

I have to stack the gold block on top of the green block to start creating the base for the stack involving the red block. The action sequence is:\n   - pick up the gold block\n   - stack the gold block on the green block\n\n2. Now, for the red block to be on top of the gold, I will proceed as follows:\n   - pick up the red block\n   - stack the red block on the gold block\n\n3. Next, the cyan block goes on top of the red block:\n   - pick up the cyan block\n   - stack the cyan block on the red block\n\n4. The violet block needs to be on top of the cyan block:\n   - pick up the violet block\n   - stack the violet block on the cyan block\n\n5.

The black block needs to be on the orange block:\n   - pick up the black block\n   - stack the black block on the orange block\n\n8. Next, the magenta block is stacked on the black block:\n   - pick up the magenta block\n   - stack the magenta block on the black block\n\n9. For the arrangement involving blue, it will be stacked on magenta:\n   - pick up the blue block\n   - stack the blue block on the magenta block\n\n10. The white block needs to be stacked on the blue block:\n    - pick up the white block\n    - stack the white block on the blue block\n\n11.

        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE\n\nThe underlying principles of stacking blocks require that a block can only be stacked on top of another block if the block being stacked upon is clear. Given the goal and initial conditions, we have five blocks to manage: orange, yellow, red, magenta, and blue.\n\n1. **Pick up the orange block:** \n   - The first step involves picking up the \"orange block\" when the hand is empty. Since the \"orange block\" is clear and placed on the table, it can be picked up as per the rules.\n\n2. **Stack orange on blue:**\n   - Next step, we stack the \"orange block\" on top of the \"blue block,\" which is clear. Post-stacking, the blue block is no longer clear, but this action fulfills one of the final conditions.\n\n3. **Pick up the yellow block:**\n   - Another action with a free hand is required for continuing with forming the stack. Therefore, \"yellow block,\" currently clear and placed on the table, can be picked up as the next step.\n\n4. **Stack yellow on orange:**\n   - After picking up the \"yellow block,\" the next goal is to stack it on top of the already placed \"orange block.\"\n\n5. **Pick up the red block:**\n   - Continuing in a free-handed sequence with clear blocks, the next step is to pick up the \"red block,\" which is currently clear.\n\n6. **Stack red on yellow:**\n   - The \"red block\" can be stacked onto the \"yellow block,\" which is currently on top of the \"orange block,\" to partially meet the stated goal.\n\n7. **Pick up the magenta block:**\n   - Finally, I will pick up the \"magenta block\" (clear and placed on the table) as the current goal requires us to stack it on another block.\n\n8. **Stack magenta on red:**\n   - The last step is to stack the \"magenta block\" on top of the \"red block\" to satisfy all the goal conditions.\n\nEach step in the plan ensures that blocks are clear and the hand is empty at the appropriate moments for successful execution.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red yellow)\n(pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta red)",

        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE\n\nGiven the initial conditions and the goal, the plan can be outlined as follows:\n\n1. Begin with the stack that allows the other stacks to be built. Since red block needs to be on top of white, pick up the red block and stack it on the white block.\n\n2. The gold block needs to be on top of the red block. Thus, pick up the gold block and stack it on the red block.\n\n3. The yellow block needs to be on top of the gold block. Therefore, pick up the yellow block and stack it on the gold block.\n\n4. The green block needs to be on top of the yellow block. As such, pick up the green block and stack it on the yellow block.\n\n5. The orange block needs to be on top of the green block. Hence, pick up the orange block and stack it on the green block.\n\n6. The violet block needs to be on top of the orange block. Thus, pick up the violet block and stack it on the orange block.\n\n7. Next, the black block needs to be on top of the violet block. So, pick up the black block and stack it on the violet block.\n\n8. Finally, the cyan block needs to be on top of the black block. Therefore, pick up the cyan block and stack it on the black block.\n\nThis strategy aligns with the goal conditions and respects the action restrictions provided.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up red)\n(stack red white)\n(pick-up gold)\n(stack gold red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow gold)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange green)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet orange)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black violet)\n(pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan black)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal configuration, we need to arrange the blocks such that each block is on top of another block in a specific order. We need to ensure that only one block is picked up or stacked at a time while maintaining the emptiness of the hand and the clearness of the blocks that need stacking.\n\n1. Begin by stacking the foundation, starting with the block that has no other block on top, which in this case involves beginning with the blue block and black block. Pick up the black block and stack it on the blue block because the black block is on top of the blue block in the goal configuration.\n\n2. Pick up the magenta block and stack it on the black block, since the magenta must eventually get on top of the black, following our goal.\n\n3. Pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the magenta, securing the chain orange \u2192 magenta \u2192 black \u2192 blue.\n\n4. Now, pick up the cyan block and stack it onto the orange, adhering to the cyan \u2192 orange part of the goal configuration.\n\n5. Pick up the yellow block and stack it onto the cyan block as yellow is on top of cyan.\n\n6. Pick up the violet block and stack it on yellow since violet is meant to be on top of the yellow block.\n\n7. For the next stack, start with the silver block and then stack it on the violet, following the chain up for the silver block.\n\n8. Pick up the gold block and stack it onto silver, completing the part of the stack where gold is on top of silver.\n\n9. Now, pick up the white block and stack it onto gold, following the goal.\n\n10. Pick up the red block and stack it on white, adhering to the red \u2192 white part of the goal stack.\n\n11. Finally, pick up the green block and stack it on the red, culminating in the green \u2192 red \u2192 white stack.\n\nIn this way, the initial block configuration is properly transitioned into the final configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up black)\n(stack black blue)\n(pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta black)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange magenta)\n(pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan orange)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow cyan)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet yellow)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver violet)\n(pick-up gold)\n(stack gold silver)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white gold)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red white)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green red)",

        "answer": "To solve the block stacking problem, we need to perform the actions in the correct sequence and adhere to the rules, ensuring the hand is empty before picking up a block and that we only stack clear blocks.

The violet block is clear, so the stacking is permitted.\n\nNext, we move on to the gold block:\n- (pick-up gold): The gold block is clear and on the table, thus it can be picked up.\n- (stack gold red): Stack the gold block on top of the red block. The red block is clear, satisfying the condition for stacking.\n\nThen the yellow block:\n- (pick-up yellow): The yellow block is clear and on the table, allowing it to be picked up.\n- (stack yellow gold): Stack the yellow block on top of the gold block. The gold block is clear.\n\nNext, the green block:\n- (pick-up green): The green block is clear and on the table, so it is picked up.\n- (stack green yellow): The yellow block is clear, stacking the green block is authorized.\n\nThe black block follows:\n- (pick-up black): The black block can be picked up as it is clear.\n- (stack black green): The green block is clear, so the black block can be stacked on top.\n\nNow the magenta block:\n- (pick-up magenta): The magenta block is clear and on the table.\n- (stack magenta black): Stack magenta on black as black is clear.\n\nThe silver block is next:\n- (pick-up silver): The silver block is clear and on the table.\n- (stack silver magenta): The magenta block is clear for stacking.\n\nNext is the cyan block:\n- (pick-up cyan): The cyan block is clear and on the table.\n- (stack cyan silver): The silver block is clear, allowing the action.\n\nThen the orange block:\n- (pick-up orange): The orange block is clear and on the table.\n- (stack orange cyan): Cyan is clear, permitting this stack.\n\nNow the blue block:\n- (pick-up blue): The blue block is clear and on the table.\n- (stack blue orange): The orange block is clear, hence stacking is allowed.\n\nFinally, the white block:\n- (pick-up white): The white block is clear and located on the table.\n- (stack white blue): The blue block is clear, so this stacking is valid.\n\nWith all actions executed according to the specified order, we attain the desired configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up red)\n(stack red violet)\n(pick-up gold)\n(stack gold red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow gold)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green yellow)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black green)\n(pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta black)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver magenta)\n(pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan silver)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange cyan)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white blue)",

(This fulfills the goal of having the gold block on top of the white block.)\n  - Pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the gold block. (This sets up the orange block on top of the gold block.)\n  - Pick up the violet block and stack it on top of the orange block. (This places the violet block on top of the orange block.)\n  - Pick up the cyan block and stack it on top of the violet block. (This positions the cyan block on top of the violet block.)\n  - Pick up the red block and stack it on top of the cyan block. (This places the red block on top of the cyan block.)\n  - Pick up the black block and stack it on top of the red block. (This establishes the black block on top of the red block.)\n  - Pick up the silver block and stack it on top of the black block. (This results in the silver block on top of the black block.)\n  - Pick up the blue block and stack it on top of the silver block. (This ensures the blue block is on top of the silver block.)\n  - Pick up the yellow block and stack it on top of the blue block. (This ensures the yellow block is on top of the blue block.)\n  - Pick up the green block and stack it on top of the yellow block.

        "answer": "To solve the block stacking problem, we need to follow the goal conditions in a logical order while adhering to the action restrictions provided. Starting with the initial conditions, we will need to form stacks in a specific order to ensure that all blocks end up in their required places.\n\n1. Begin by focusing on the stack's base, starting with what will end up at the bottom of any stack. Looking at the goals, the orange block needs the black block on top of it, so we start with the orange block:\n   - Pick up the black block.\n   - Stack the black block on top of the orange block.\n\n2. Next, we see from the goal that the blue block should be on top of the black block:\n   - Pick up the blue block.\n   - Stack the blue block on top of the black block.\n\n3. Now, looking at the base of the next part of the required stack, we see the blue block should be placed under the green block:\n   - Pick up the green block.\n   - Stack the green block on top of the blue block.\n\n4. Finally, we see that the red block needs to be on top of the green block:\n   - Pick up the red block.\n   - Stack the red block on top of the green block.\n\nBy following these steps, we've managed to achieve the final goal conditions stated.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(pick-up black)\n(stack black orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue black)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red green)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal, we need to arrange the blocks according to the specified stack sequence. I'll start by evaluating the given task and plan to ensure that it satisfies the goal with the provided constraints.\n\n1. **Pick up the yellow block:** The yellow block is clear and on the table, and the hand is empty. This satisfies the constraints, so it is a valid move.\n\n2. **Stack the yellow block on top of the green block:** The green block is clear because it's on the table with no blocks on top, and the hand holds the yellow block. This is a valid action.\n\n3. **Pick up the blue block:** The blue block is clear and on the table, and the hand is empty again after the previous action.\n\n4. **Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block:** The yellow block is clear because it's newly placed on top of the green block, and the hand is holding the blue block. This satisfies the conditions for stacking.\n\n5. **Pick up the silver block:** The silver block is clear and on the table, and the hand is empty. This action is valid.\n\n6. **Stack the silver block on top of the blue block:** The blue block is clear without any block on it, and the hand is holding the silver block. Thus, this action is valid.\n\n7. **Pick up the violet block:** The violet block is clear and on the table, with the hand empty, making this a valid action.\n\n8. **Stack the violet block on top of the silver block:** The silver block is clear, and the hand is holding the violet block, fulfilling the conditions for this action.\n\n9. **Pick up the orange block:** The orange block is clear and on the table, with the hand empty. This action is valid.\n\n10. **Stack the orange block on top of the violet block:** The violet block is clear, and the hand is holding the orange block, so this action is valid. This achieves the condition of the magenta block being on top of the orange block.\n\n11. **Pick up the magenta block:** The magenta block is clear and on the table, with the hand empty. This is a valid action.\n\n12. **Stack the magenta block on top of the orange block:** The orange block is clear, and the hand is holding the magenta block.

Since both magenta and green are clear on the table, we can directly pick up the magenta block and stack it on the green block.\n2. Next, the white block must be stacked on top of the magenta block. The white block is currently clear on the table, so we first pick up the white block and then stack it on the magenta block.\n3. We then stack the blue block on top of the white block. Since the blue block is clear and on the table, we pick it up and stack it on the white block.\n4. Following this, the black block goes on top of the blue block. The black block is clear and on the table, so we pick it up and stack it on the blue block.\n5. Next, the violet block should be on top of the black block.

Start with the given initial conditions where all blocks (red, blue, white, silver) are on the table and clear, and the hand is empty.\n\n2. The goal states that the blue block will be on top of the silver block. Thus, the first step is to pick up the blue block from the table. Since the blue block is clear and on the table, we can pick it up.\n\n3. Once the blue block is picked up, we stack it on top of the silver block. This configuration leaves the blue block on the silver block, achieving one part of the goal.\n\n4. Next, to achieve the configuration where the white block is on top of the blue block (which is now on top of the silver block), we pick up the white block from the table. Since the white block is clear, we can pick it up.\n\n5. After picking up the white block, we stack it on top of the blue block. This step achieves the second part of our goal, where the white block is on top of the blue block (and consequently on top of the silver block).\n\n6. Finally, the goal requires the red block to be on top of the white block, which is currently on top of the blue block. We pick up the red block from the table, as it is clear.\n\n7.

Since the red block is on the table and clear initially, we can pick up the white block and stack it on the red block.\n\n- Next, we need the orange block on top of the white block. After stacking the white block on the red block, the white block becomes clear. So, we pick up the orange block and stack it on the white block.\n\n- We need the green block on top of the orange block next. Since the orange block is on the white block now and is clear, we can pick up the green block and stack it on the orange block.\n\n- Then, we require the blue block on top of the green block. Since the green block is on the orange block and is clear, we pick up the blue block and stack it on the green block.\n\n- Finally, we need the yellow block on top of the blue block. As the blue block is on the green block and is clear, we pick up the yellow block and stack it on the blue block.\n\nThis sequence fulfills the requirements of making sure blocks are only stacked on clear blocks and arranging the blocks as per the goal.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up white)\n(stack white red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange white)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue green)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal, we need to stack the blocks in a particular sequence while following the given rules and initial conditions. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. The orange block needs to be on top of the white block. Since the orange block is clear and on the table, I can pick it up and stack it on the white block.\n2. The yellow block needs to be on top of the orange block. Since the yellow block is clear and on the table, I can pick it up and stack it on the orange block.\n3. The silver block needs to be on top of the yellow block. Since the silver block is clear and on the table, I can pick it up and stack it on the yellow block.\n4. The blue block needs to be on top of the silver block. Since the blue block is clear and on the table, I can pick it up and stack it on the silver block.\n5. Finally, the green block needs to be on top of the blue block. Since the green block is clear and on the table, I can pick it up and stack it on the blue block.\n\nFollowing these steps while ensuring each block placement maintains a clear bottom block allows us to comply with the rules and reach the goal configuration.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange white)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue silver)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green blue)\n```",
