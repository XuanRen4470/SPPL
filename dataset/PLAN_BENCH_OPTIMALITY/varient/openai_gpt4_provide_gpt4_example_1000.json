The **red block** is on top of the **orange block**, and the **yellow block** is on the top of the **red block**.\n3. The **orange block** is on the table, and the **hand is empty**.\n\n#### Goal:\nTo achieve the following configuration:\n- The **blue block** is on top of the **red block**.\n- The **yellow block** is on top of the **orange block**.\n\n#### Steps to Achieve the Goal:\n1. **Unstack the blue block from the yellow block**:\n   - Unstacking makes the yellow block clear.\n   \n2. **Put down the blue block**:\n   - This allows further manipulation of the underlying blocks.\n\n3. **Unstack the yellow block from the red block**:\n   - Necessary to free the red block for repositioning.\n\n4. **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block**:\n   - This moves the yellow block closer to the final position, but temporarily places it elsewhere.\n\n5. **Unstack the red block from the orange block**:\n   - Making it available for repositioning.\n\n6. **Put down the red block**:\n   - Place it on the table to make room for stacking changes.\n\n7. **Unstack the yellow block from the blue block**:\n   - Move it to achieve the desired position in relation to the orange block.\n\n8. **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block**:\n   - Fulfills the condition of having the yellow above the orange block.\n\n9. **Pick up the blue block**:\n   - Prepare to place it in the final position.\n\n10. **Stack the blue block on top of the red block**:\n   - Achieves the final goal condition of having the blue block on top of the red block.\n\n### Time Calculation:\nEach action takes 1 minute, so the total time is 10 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack yellow red)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue red)",

The **yellow block** is on top of the **blue block** and the whole stack is on the table.\n4. The **hand is empty**.\n\n### Goal:\n- The **red block** is on top of the **blue block**.\n- The **orange block** is on top of the **yellow block**.\n\n### Steps to Achieve the Goal:\nTo achieve this, we need to:\n1. Unstack the **red block** from the **yellow block**.\n2. Temporarily place the **red block** on the **orange block**.\n3. Unstack the **yellow block** from above the **blue block**.\n4. Put down the **yellow block** to use it later.\n5. Unstack the **red block** from the **orange block**, which is a temporary position from step 2.\n6. Stack the **red block** onto the **blue block**.\n7. Pick up the **orange block**.\n8. Stack the **orange block** on top of the **yellow block**.\n\n### Plan and Time Calculation:\n1. **Unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block** (1 minute): The **red block** is clear and can be unstacked easily.\n2. **Stack the red block on top of the orange block** (1 minute): Place the red block temporarily on the orange block, which is clear.\n3. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block** (1 minute): The yellow block is now clear and can be unstacked.\n4. **Put down the yellow block** (1 minute): We need it free to put another block on.\n5. **Unstack the red block from on top of the orange block** (1 minute): Remove the red block from its temporary position to achieve its final goal position.\n6. **Stack the red block on top of the blue block** (1 minute): Achieves the first part of the goal configuration.\n7. **Pick up the orange block** (1 minute): Prepare to place it on its target location.\n8. **Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block** (1 minute): Complete the final part of the goal configuration.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe above plan efficiently achieves the desired configurations with minimal time. Each step requires a clear understanding of the initial conditions and transitions required for the blocks\u2019 final destinations.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack red yellow)  \n(stack red orange)  \n(unstack yellow blue)  \n(put-down yellow)  \n(unstack red orange)  \n(stack red blue)  \n(pick-up orange)  \n(stack orange yellow) ",

The **hand is empty**.\n4. The **red block** is on top of the **blue block**.\n5. The **orange block** is on top of the **yellow block**.\n6.

Make the **blue block** on top of the **yellow block**.\n3. Make the **yellow block** on top of the **red block**.\n\n### Steps to Achieve the Goal:\n1. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block**:\n   - Necessary because the orange block needs to move under the red block, and the yellow block needs to be stacked above the red block. The unstacking action frees the orange block.\n\n2. **Put down the orange block**:\n   - It's crucial to make the hand empty to pick up other blocks and rearrange further.\n\n3. **Unstack the red block from on top of the blue block**:\n   - The red block must be free to be stacked on top of the orange block subsequently.\n\n4. **Stack the red block on top of the orange block**:\n   - This step aligns with part of the goal configuration.\n\n5. **Pick up the yellow block**:\n   - The yellow block needs to be lifted to allow restructuring of stacking order that satisfies the goal.\n\n6. **Stack the yellow block on top of the red block**:\n   - This completes another part of the goal configuration by placing yellow on top of red.\n\n7. **Pick up the blue block**:\n   - We need the blue block to relocate it atop the yellow block, matching the desired final setup.\n\n8. **Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block**:\n   - This completes the final step of the desired configuration after which the goal is entirely achieved.\n\nBy following the above steps, the new stack arrangement satisfies the problem's goal efficiently.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack red blue)\n(stack red orange)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue yellow)",

(1 minute)  \n   - Leaves **red block** clear and **orange block** on top of **yellow block**.\n\n3. **Pick up the red block**. (1 minute)  \n   - We need to achieve **red block** on **blue block**.\n\n4. **Stack the red block** on top of the blue block. (1 minute)  \n   - Places **red block** on **blue block**.\n\n5. **Unstack the orange block** from on top of the yellow block. (1 minute)  \n   - Again, **orange block** in hand, **yellow block** clear.\n\n6. **Stack the orange block** on top of the red block. (1 minute)  \n   - Now **orange block** on top of **red block**.\n\n7. **Pick up the yellow block**. (1 minute)  \n   - Get ready to place **yellow block** on the **orange block**.\n\n8. **Stack the yellow block** on top of the orange block. (1 minute)  \n   - Final move to achieve the goal configuration.\n\n### Total Time:\nThe total time required for these actions is **8 minutes**.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange red)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(stack orange red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)",

This takes 1 minute.\n\n2. **Orange Block**:\n   - Before stacking the orange block onto the red block, the yellow block on top of the orange block needs to be removed to make the orange block clear.\n   - **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block**. This takes 1 minute.\n   - **Put down the yellow block**. This takes 1 minute.\n   - Now, **pick up the orange block**. This takes 1 minute.\n   - **Stack the orange block on top of the red block**. This takes 1 minute.\n\n### Total Time:\nThe total time required for these actions is 6 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)",

The **blue block** is on the table.\n4. The **yellow block** is clear and on the table.\n5. The **hand** is empty.\n\n#### Goal:\n1. The **red block** should be on top of the **yellow block**.\n2. The **blue block** should be on top of the **orange block**.\n3. The **yellow block** should be on top of the **blue block**.\n\n#### Observations and Steps to Achieve the Goal:\n- To start aligning blocks as per the goal:\n  1. We need to clear the **orange block** by unstacking the **red block**.\n  2. Use the empty hand to unstack, put down, and then rearrange appropriately.\n\n#### Plan:\n1. **Unstack the red block from on top of the orange block** (1 minute).\n2. **Put down the red block** (1 minute). Now, both the orange and red blocks are on the table.\n3. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block** (1 minute).\n4. **Put down the orange block** (1 minute). Now, the blue block is clear.\n5. **Pick up the blue block** (1 minute).\n6. **Stack the blue block on top of the orange block** (1 minute). Now, the blue is on orange.\n7. **Pick up the yellow block** (1 minute).\n8. **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block** (1 minute). Now, yellow is on top of the blue.\n9. **Pick up the red block** (1 minute).\n10. **Stack the red block on top of the yellow block** (1 minute).
