        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the blue block, with the blue block on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block on top of the orange block, let's carefully plan the sequence of actions. Here is a step-by-step plan to achieve this goal while minimizing the time taken:\n\n**Initial Conditions:**\n- Red block is clear.\n- Blue block is clear.\n- Yellow block is clear.\n- Hand is empty.\n- Red block is on top of the orange block.\n- Blue block is on the table.\n- Orange block is on the table.\n- Yellow block is on the table.\n\n**Goal:**\n- Red block is on top of the blue block.\n- Blue block is on top of the yellow block.\n- Yellow block is on top of the orange block.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. **Unstack the red block from on top of the orange block:**\n   - This step is necessary to free the red block.\n   - Time: 1 minute\n\n2. **Put down the red block:**\n   - Frees up the hand and keeps the red block clear.\n   - Time: 1 minute\n\n3. **Pick up the yellow block:**\n   - Prepares the yellow block for stacking.\n   - Time: 1 minute\n\n4. **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block:**\n   - Forms the base part of the desired stack.\n   - Time: 1 minute\n\n5. **Pick up the blue block:**\n   - Prepares the blue block for stacking.\n   - Time: 1 minute\n\n6. **Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block:**\n   - Completes the middle stack.\n   - Time: 1 minute\n\n7. **Pick up the red block:**\n   - Prepares the red block for the final stack.\n   - Time: 1 minute\n\n8. **Stack the red block on top of the blue block:**\n   - Achieves the goal with the minimum stack order.\n   - Time: 1 minute\n\n**Total Time:**\n- 1 (unstack red) + 1 (put down red) + 1 (pick up yellow) + 1 (stack yellow on orange) + 1 (pick up blue) + 1 (stack blue on yellow) + 1 (pick up red) + 1 (stack red on blue) = 8 minutes\n\nSo, the plan to achieve the goal in the minimum time is:\n\n1. Unstack the red block from on top of the orange block.\n2. Put down the red block.\n3. Pick up the yellow block.\n4. Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block.\n5. Pick up the blue block.\n6. Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block.\n7. Pick up the red block.\n8. Stack the red block on top of the blue block.\n\nThe total time to execute this plan is 8 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the blue block on top of the red block, the orange block on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block on top of the blue block, we need to carefully plan the sequence of actions to minimize the time taken. Here is a step-by-step inference to achieve our goals efficiently:\n\n**Initial Conditions:**\n- Red block is clear\n- Orange block is clear\n- Yellow block is clear\n- Hand is empty\n- Orange block is on top of the blue block\n- Red block is on the table\n- Blue block is on the table\n- Yellow block is on the table\n\n**Goal:**\n- Blue block is on top of the red block\n- Orange block is on top of the yellow block\n- Yellow block is on top of the blue block\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block**: The orange block is currently obstructing our goal setup. This action requires 1 minute.\n\n2. **Put down the orange block**: This will free the orange from the hand and keep it aside for now. This step takes 1 minute.\n\n3. **Pick up the blue block**: We need the blue block in our hand to position it as per the goal. This takes 1 minute.\n\n4. **Stack the blue block on top of the red block**: This places blue in position as per our first part of the goal. This step takes 1 minute.\n\n5. **Pick up the yellow block**: We now need the yellow to place it as per the target setup. This action requires 1 minute.\n\n6. **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block**: This puts the yellow block in its correct position over blue. This step takes 1 minute.\n\n7. **Pick up the orange block**: Once the yellow is correctly placed, we will use the orange block again. This takes 1 minute.\n\n8. **Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block**: This places the orange as required to complete the goal. This action requires 1 minute.\n\n**Total Time:**\n- 1 (unstack orange) + 1 (put down orange) + 1 (pick up blue) + 1 (stack blue on red) + 1 (pick up yellow) + 1 (stack yellow on blue) + 1 (pick up orange) + 1 (stack orange on yellow) = 8 minutes\n\nThus, the plan required to achieve the goal efficiently with minimal time is:\n\n1. Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block.\n2. Put down the orange block.\n3. Pick up the blue block.\n4. Stack the blue block on top of the red block.\n5. Pick up the yellow block.\n6. Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n7. Pick up the orange block.\n8. Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of stacking the red block on top of the orange block and then the yellow block on top of the red block, we need to carefully evaluate the steps required based on the initial conditions and constraints. Let's outline the process step by step to achieve the desired configuration while minimizing time.\n\n**Initial Conditions:**\n- Red block is clear\n- Blue block is clear\n- Yellow block is clear\n- Hand is empty\n- Blue block is on top of the orange block\n- Red block is on the table\n- Orange block is on the table\n- Yellow block is on the table\n\n**Goal:**\n- Red block on top of the orange block\n- Yellow block on top of the red block\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block:**\n   - Starting by removing the blue block because we need the orange block clear to stack red on it.\n   - Time: 1 minute\n\n2. **Put down the blue block:**\n   - Putting down the blue block to handle the red block next.\n   - Time: 1 minute\n\n3. **Pick up the red block:**\n   - Preparing to stack it on the orange block.\n   - Time: 1 minute\n\n4. **Stack the red block on top of the orange block:**\n   - This puts the red block in the correct position.\n   - Time: 1 minute\n\n5. **Pick up the yellow block:**\n   - Next step to position it on top of the red block.\n   - Time: 1 minute\n\n6. **Stack the yellow block on top of the red block:**\n   - This completes the configuration required.\n   - Time: 1 minute\n\n**Total Time:**\n- 1 (unstack blue) + 1 (put down blue) + 1 (pick up red) + 1 (stack red on orange) + 1 (pick up yellow) + 1 (stack yellow on red) = 6 minutes\n\nSo, the plan to achieve the goal with minimized time is:\n\n1. Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block.\n2. Put down the blue block.\n3. Pick up the red block.\n4. Stack the red block on top of the orange block.\n5. Pick up the yellow block.\n6. Stack the yellow block on top of the red block.\n\nThe setup will take a total of 6 minutes to execute.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)",
