        "answer": "To solve this problem, we must assess the current situation and determine the optimal steps to rearrange the blocks into the desired configuration, minimizing the total time spent.\n\nInitial State:\n\n- The blue block is clear and on the table.\n- The orange block is clear and also on the table.\n- The hand is empty.\n- The red block is on top of the yellow block.\n- The orange block is on top of the red block.\n- The yellow block is on the table.\n\nGoal:\n\n- The red block is on top of the blue block.\n- The orange block is on top of the red block.\n- The yellow block is on top of the orange block.\n\nGiven the goal, we need to move the blocks according to the actions described. Here's the plan with appropriate rationale:\n\n1. Unstack the orange block from on top of the red block since we need to make the red block clear. This takes 1 minute.\n2. Put down the orange block onto the table to free the red block. This also takes 1 minute.\n3. Unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block to prepare it for stacking on the blue block. This action takes 1 minute.\n4. Stack the red block on top of the blue block, fulfilling the first goal condition. This step takes 1 minute.\n5. Pick up the orange block from the table to stack it onto the red block. This is a separate 1-minute action.\n6. Stack the orange block on top of the red block, completing the second condition of our goal. This takes 1 minute.\n7. Pick up the yellow block from the table to place it on the stack. Picking it up takes 1 minute.\n8. Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block, achieving the final goal condition. This step also takes 1 minute.\n\nFollowing these steps will let us achieve the desired stack in the minimal time, applying each rule correctly to make sure our hand is empty and blocks are clear before we pick, unstack, or stack.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack orange red)  \n(put-down orange)  \n(unstack red yellow)  \n(stack red blue)  \n(pick-up orange)  \n(stack orange red)  \n(pick-up yellow)  \n(stack yellow orange)",

Unstack the yellow block from the orange block to make the orange block clear.\n6. Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block, achieving part of our goal.\n7. Pick up the orange block from the table.\n8. Finally, stack the orange block on top of the red block to fully achieve our goal.\n\nExecuting this step-by-step plan will achieve the desired final state within the constraints given and should take a total of 8 minutes. \n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)",

The blue block is currently on top of the red block, but needs to be on top of the yellow block. We will first unstack the yellow block from the blue block since the yellow block is initially clear and on top of the blue block, so it can be picked up.\n\n2. Once the yellow block is picked up, we will stack the yellow block on the orange block. This clears the path for rearranging the blue and red blocks.\n\n3. Next, unstack the blue block from the red block. Now, the blue block can be moved freely. \n\n4. Finally, stack the blue block on the yellow block to achieve the goal setup.\n\nBy following these steps, the blocks will be in the desired configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow blue) (stack yellow orange) (unstack blue red) (stack blue yellow)",

        "answer": "To find the optimal plan, we first need to examine the initial state and the goal state.\n\nInitial State:\n- The red block is clear.\n- The yellow block is clear.\n- The hand is empty.\n- The blue block is on top of the orange block.\n- The yellow block is on top of the blue block.\n- The red block and the orange block are on the table.\n\nGoal:\n- The red block is on top of the blue block.\n- The blue block is on top of the orange block.\n- The yellow block is on top of the red block.\n\nFirst, observe that the yellow block is on top of the blue block and needs to be removed so that the blue block can later support the red block. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block**: This takes 1 minute. Now, the yellow block is being held.\n\n2. **Put down the yellow block**: Place it back on the table. This takes 1 minute.\n\n3. **Pick up the red block**: Since the red block is initially clear and the hand is empty, we can pick it up. This takes 1 minute.\n\n4. **Stack the red block on top of the blue block**: The blue block is now clear and on the table, allowing the red block to be placed on top. This action takes 1 minute.\n\n5. **Pick up the yellow block**: Now, grab the yellow block from the table. This takes 1 minute.\n\n6. **Stack the yellow block on top of the red block**: The red block is currently clear and on top of the blue block, enabling the yellow block to be placed on it. This stack action takes 1 minute.\n\nThe total time to execute this plan is 6 minutes, which is efficient given the constraints.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow blue)  \n(put-down yellow)  \n(pick-up red)  \n(stack red blue)  \n(pick-up yellow)  \n(stack yellow red)  ",

Stack the orange block on top of the red block.\n5. Pick up the yellow block from the table.\n6. Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block.\n\nExplanation:\n1. Initially, the red block is on top of the orange block, and we need the red block to end up on top of the blue block with the orange block on top of it. Thus, we start by unstacking the red block from the orange block so it can be moved to the blue block.\n2. Once the red block is free, we stack it on top of the blue block which is already on the table.\n3. Then, we pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the red block for the next position.\n4.

        "answer": "To address the problem, we need to conduct a step-by-step analysis of the initial conditions and how to achieve the stated goal by manipulating the blocks while adhering to the rules provided.\n\n**Initial Conditions:**\n- The yellow block is clear.\n- The hand is empty.\n- The red block is on top of the blue block.\n- The blue block is on top of the orange block.\n- The yellow block is on top of the red block.\n- The orange block is on the table.\n\n**Goal:**\n- The red block is on top of the yellow block.\n- The orange block is on top of the blue block.\n- The yellow block is on top of the orange block.\n\nLet's break down the task into actionable steps:\n\n1. **Unstacking the Yellow Block:**\n   - Since the yellow block is clear, we can pick it up and unstack it from the red block. \n\n2. **Placing Down the Yellow Block:**\n   - We then put down the yellow block to free the red block.\n\n3. **Unstacking the Red Block:**\n   - Next, unstack the red block from the blue block to make sure it is free for future stacking.\n\n4. **Placing Down the Red Block:**\n   - After unstacking, we place the red block down to make sure our hand is empty for the next actions.\n\n5. **Unstacking the Blue Block:**\n   - Remove the blue block from on top of the orange block to free the orange block for future actions.\n\n6. **Putting Down the Blue Block:**\n   - Place the blue block down to maintain an empty hand.\n\n7. **Picking Up the Orange Block:**\n   - With the blue block out of the way, we can now pick up the orange block.\n\n8. **Stacking the Orange Block:**\n   - Stack the orange block on top of the blue block to meet one of the goals.\n\n9. **Picking Up the Yellow Block Again:**\n   - Retrieve the yellow block that was placed down earlier.\n\n10. **Stacking the Yellow Block:**\n    - Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block to achieve another part of the goal.\n\n11. **Picking Up the Red Block Once More:**\n    - Finally, pick up the red block.\n\n12. **Stacking the Red Block:**\n    - Stack the red block on top of the yellow block to fulfill the final goal.\n\nBy following these ordered steps, the goals are achieved in a sequence that respects all the rules laid out for block manipulation.

The first goal is to get the red block on top of the blue block. The blue block is clear, but the red block is currently under the blue block. Therefore, we have to unstack the blue block from the red block first:\n    - Unstack the blue block from the red block (1 minute).\n\n2. Now, put down the blue block to free your hand:\n    - Put down the blue block (1 minute).\n\n3. Pick up the red block to move it:\n    - Pick up the red block (1 minute).\n\n4. Stack the red block on top of the blue block, achieving the first part of the goal:\n    - Stack the red block on top of the blue block (1 minute).\n\n5. The next step is to move the orange block on top of the red block. The orange block has the yellow block on top of it, so we need to unstack the yellow block first:\n    - Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block (1 minute).\n\n6. Put down the yellow block to proceed with moving the orange block:\n    - Put down the yellow block (1 minute).\n\n7. Pick up the orange block:\n    - Pick up the orange block (1 minute).\n\n8. Stack the orange block on top of the red block, achieving the second part of the goal:\n    - Stack the orange block on top of the red block (1 minute).\n\n9. Finally, to complete the goal, stack the yellow block back onto the orange block:\n    - Pick up the yellow block (1 minute).\n    - Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block (1 minute).\n\nBy following this sequence of actions, the goal state will be achieved in the minimum time possible.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)",

We then focus on unstacking the orange block from the yellow block.\n3. Once the orange block is clear, it will need to be restacked back on top of the red block.\n4. After that, place the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n5. Lastly, rearrange the orange block back on the yellow block by first unstacking it from the red block and then placing the red block back on top of the orange block for completion.\n\nHere\u2019s the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Unstack the red block from on top of the orange block (1 minute)\n2. Put down the red block (1 minute)\n3. Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block (1 minute)\n4. Stack the orange block on top of the red block (1 minute)\n5. Pick up the yellow block (1 minute)\n6. Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block (1 minute)\n7. Unstack the orange block from on top of the red block (1 minute)\n8. Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block (1 minute)\n9. Pick up the red block (1 minute)\n10. Stack the red block on top of the orange block (1 minute)\n\nTotal time: 10 minutes\n\nThis plan effectively repositions the blocks to achieve the desired goal state in a minimal and logical sequence of actions.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(stack orange red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(unstack orange red)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)",

To rearrange them as per the goal, unstack the yellow block from the red block. This again takes 1 minute.\n4. The blue block has been put down and the yellow block needs restacking later, so let's stack the yellow block on the now free blue one, as part of achieving the goal state later. This action also takes 1 minute.\n5. Now, pick up the orange block (which is clear and has been freed by the first step) to prepare for stacking it. This takes 1 minute.\n6. Stack the orange block on top of the red block to start forming the correct goal stack. This action takes 1 minute.\n7. The goal rearrangement requires the yellow block to finally be on top of the orange block. Therefore, unstack the yellow block from the blue block. This action will take 1 minute.\n8.
