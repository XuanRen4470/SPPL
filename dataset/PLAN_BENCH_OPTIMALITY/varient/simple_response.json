Start by unstacking blocks from the top to clear the path for rearranging the blue block on top of the orange block and placing the orange block on top of the yellow block. This involves freeing both the blue block from on top of the red block and subsequently moving the orange block into position first, since it supports the final structure beneath the blue block.

The blue block and orange block start clear and separate in position. To achieve the goal of having the yellow block on top of the orange block, we need to move yellow after it's made clear. Start by unstacking the red block from the yellow block so both the red and yellow are individually clear. Place the red block down, then pick up the yellow block, and stack it onto the orange block. Finally, pick the red block back up and stack it onto the yellow block to achieve the final arrangement.

        "answer": "The initial conditions indicate that the red block is on top of the orange block, and the blue block is on top of the yellow block. Both the orange and yellow blocks are on the table, and the hand is empty. According to the goal, we need the orange block on top of the blue block and the yellow block on top of the orange block. To achieve this, we must temporarily move some blocks to make the necessary blocks clear. First, we unstack the red block from the orange block, then put down the red block to clear the orange one. Next, we unstack the blue block from the yellow block to make the yellow block available. We place the blue block on the table. Then, pick up the orange block and stack it on the blue block. Finally, pick up the yellow block and stack it on the orange block.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)",

Start by unstacking the red block from on top of the blue block to free the blue block and make red a base.\n2. Place the red block down to clear the blue.\n3. Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block, preparing the orange for its eventual placement.\n4. Stack the orange block on the blue block as the initial part of achieving the goal state where blue should be at the base.\n5. Pick up the yellow block so that it can later be repositioned.\n6. Stack the yellow block onto the red block, aligning correctly with the goal's formation.\n7. Unstack the orange block from the blue block since the final sequence doesn\u2019t require them to be directly stacked initially.\n8. Stack the orange block on the yellow block to match the requirement.\n9. Pick up the blue block, the last objective in the sequence.\n10.

Initially, the orange block is on the table, and both the red and yellow blocks need to be repositioned from their current locations. The blue block, which is currently on the red block, needs to be placed aside to allow manipulation of the lower blocks. We begin by unstacking the blue block from the red block to have access to the red and yellow blocks. After putting down the blue block, we then unstack the red block from the yellow block and place it aside. Next, we unstack the yellow block from the orange block and stack it onto the blue block to clear the path for the orange block.

The objective is to rearrange the blocks such that the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, and the yellow block is on top of the blue block. \n\nFirst, to ensure the red block can be stacked last and on top of the yellow block, it needs to be unstacked from the orange block, which will necessitate placing it down or moving it to a different part of the setup temporarily. With the red block now independently managed, unstack the orange block from the blue block, clear it and put it down elsewhere.
