        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE:\nTo achieve the given goal state from the initial conditions, we must perform the following operations in a sequence where each block is placed on top of the corresponding block or stack. The initial condition specifies that all blocks are clear and on the table, with the hand being empty, thus we can start picking and stacking blocks in order.\n\n1. Start by picking up the green block and stack it on top of the red block. This satisfies the condition of having the green block on top of the red block.\n\n2. Then, pick up the magenta block and stack it on top of the green block to achieve the sequence green->red and magenta->green.\n\n3. Next, pick up the yellow block and stack it on top of the magenta block to get yellow->magenta.\n\n4. Pick up the cyan block and stack it on top of the yellow block so that the sequence continues with cyan->yellow.\n\n5. Pick up the white block and stack it on top of the cyan block to achieve white->cyan.\n\n6.

        "answer": "INFERENCE: Our hand is empty, so we can start manipulating the blocks. We're currently considering the blocks red, orange, white, black, silver, and gold, all of which are clear and on the table. Our goal requires a specific stacking order. Starting with the black block, which needs to be placed on top of the orange block, I prioritize this sequence first. Once the black block is on the orange block, it clears the condition making the red block come next, which goes on top of the black block. After that, the gold block needs to be on the red block. This arrangement must happen successively as each layer becomes clear. Meanwhile, the white block has to be on the gold block, and lastly, the silver block needs to be on the white block. Following this order allows us to achieve the desired arrangement:\n\n1. pick up the black block\n2. stack the black block on top of the orange block\n3. pick up the red block\n4. stack the red block on top of the black block\n5. pick up the gold block\n6. stack the gold block on top of the red block\n7. pick up the white block\n8. stack the white block on top of the gold block\n9. pick up the silver block\n10. stack the silver block on top of the white block\n\nWith these steps followed, the arrangement aligns with the goal.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up black)\n(stack black orange)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red black)\n(pick-up gold)\n(stack gold red)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white gold)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver white)",

        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE\n\nGiven the initial conditions where all blocks (red, orange, yellow, magenta, black, cyan, violet, silver) are clear and on the table, and the hand is empty, we need to follow these steps to reach our goal state. Our strategy is to follow the target stacking sequence by starting from the bottom block of each required stack and working upwards.\n\n1. The black block needs to go on top of the red block. Since the black block is clear, pick it up and stack it onto the red block.\n2. Next, the orange block is needed on top of the black block. Since the orange block is clear, pick it up and stack it onto the black block.\n3. The magenta block has to go on top of the orange block. It is currently clear, so pick it up and stack it on the orange block.\n4. The silver block needs to be stacked on top of the magenta block. Pick up the silver block and place it on the magenta block.\n5. The yellow block should be on top of the silver block. Pick it up and stack it on the silver block.\n6. The cyan block goes on top of the yellow block. Pick up the cyan block and stack it onto the yellow block.\n7. Lastly, the violet block should be on top of the cyan block. Pick up the violet block and stack it on top of the cyan block.\n\nFollowing these steps, the blocks will be in the desired final positions.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up black)\n(stack black red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange black)\n(pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta orange)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver magenta)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow silver)\n(pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan yellow)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet cyan)",

Since the red block is clear and on the table, we pick up the red block. Then, we stack the red block on top of the gold block, which is also clear and on the table. Now, the gold block is no longer clear, as the red block is on top of it.\n\n2. Next, we aim to place the cyan block on top of the red block (which is now on top of the gold block). The cyan block is clear and on the table, so we pick it up next. We then stack the cyan block on top of the red block, which makes the cyan block the topmost block on this stack.\n\n3.

Blue block on top of the green block\n2. Black block on top of the gold block\n3. Green block on top of the silver block\n4. Silver block on top of the red block\n5. Gold block on top of the blue block\n\nWe should start by building the base of this structure, which means stacking according to the supporting block order.\n\nSteps:\n1. Silver needs to be at the bottom of two blocks, red (so silver -> red first). Pick up the silver block and stack it on the red block.\n2. Green goes on top of silver.

        "answer": "INFERENCE:\n\nOur initial conditions provide us with ten blocks on the table: red, blue, orange, white, magenta, black, cyan, green, violet, and gold. Each block is clear, meaning there are no blocks stacked on top of any other block, and our hand is empty, allowing us to start moving the blocks.\n\nTo achieve the goal configuration, we will perform the following steps, ensuring each block is moved only when it is clear and the hand is empty:\n\n1. Pick up the violet block and stack it on the orange block. This makes the violet block no longer clear.\n2. Pick up the red block and stack it on the violet block, rendering the violet block no longer clear.\n3. Pick up the green block and stack it on the red block, rendering the red block no longer clear.\n4. Pick up the blue block and stack it on the green block, rendering the green block no longer clear. The top of this stack achieves the goal of 'blue on green.'\n5. Pick up the black block and stack it on the blue block, rendering the blue block no longer clear.\n6. Pick up the gold block and stack it on the black block, rendering the black block no longer clear. The top of this stack achieves the goal of 'gold on black.'\n7.

Given that the hand is empty and all the blocks are clear (not stacked), we can proceed with picking them up and stacking them according to the goal.\n3. First, we pick up the gold block from the table and stack it on top of the blue block. This action results in the gold block being no longer clear, but it fulfills part of the stacking requirement.\n4. After placing the gold block, the hand becomes empty again, allowing us to pick up another block.\n5. Next, we pick up the black block and stack it on top of the gold block.

        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE: We start with the requirement that all blocks are clear and on the table. The hand is initially empty. The goal is to achieve the order: red on top of blue, blue on top of orange, orange on top of violet, white on top of red, violet on top of yellow, and silver on top of white. \n\nTo achieve this, we first handle the structure from the bottom most base upward:\n\n1. We start by stacking blocks to form the sequence ending: (violet on top of yellow). Pick up the violet block and stack it on top of the yellow block.\n\n2. Next, form the sequence (orange on top of violet): Pick up the orange block and stack it on top of violet.\n\n3. Form sequence (blue on top of orange): Pick up the blue block and stack it on top of orange.\n\n4. Form sequence (red on top of blue): Pick up the red block and stack it on top of blue.\n\n5. Form sequence (white on top of red): Pick up the white block and stack it on top of red.\n\n6. Finally, add the last layer (silver on top of white): Pick up the silver block and stack it on top of white.\n\nThis creates the desired configuration with each required block placed correctly. With the actions followed in sequence, each condition is met without violating the rules set out for stacking and picking up blocks.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange violet)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white red)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver white)",

Start with the violet block since it needs to be at the bottom of a stack (covered by the magenta block).  \n2. Pick up the violet block and stack it onto the magenta block.\n3. The green block goes on top of the violet block, so pick up the green block and stack it.\n4. The blue block goes on top of the green block, so pick up the blue block and stack it.\n5. The silver block goes on top of the blue block, so pick up the silver block and stack it.\n6. The orange block must go on top of the silver block, so pick up the orange block and stack it.\n7. The cyan block goes on top of the orange block, so pick up the cyan block and stack it.\n8. The red block is on top of the cyan block, so pick it up and stack it.\n9. The black block must go on top of the red block, pick it up and stack it.\n10. The yellow block goes on top of the black block, so pick up the yellow block and stack it.\n11.

To achieve the goal state where each block is stacked as specified, pick up the blue block first because you need it at the base of the black block. Stack the blue block on top of the magenta block. Next, pick up the black block and stack it on top of the blue block, meeting the condition specified for the goal \"the black block is on top of the blue block\". Now, pick up the orange block, and stack it on top of the black to align with \"the orange block is on top of the black block\". Finally, pick up the white block and stack it on the orange block, which aligns with the goal \"the white block is on top of the orange block\".

        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE\n\nTo achieve the desired stacking sequence with the blocks, starting from the initial condition where all blocks are clear and on the table, we need to strategically pick up and stack each block as follows:\n\n1. First, we pick up the \"red block\" to stack it on top of the \"yellow block\". This will set up the foundation for the silver stack. \n2. Next, we pick up the \"silver block\" and stack it on top of the \"red block\". This allows us to continue building the desired stack.\n3. Then, we pick up the \"orange block\" and place it on top of the \"silver block\". This positions it beneath the blue block in the end structure.\n4. We pick up the \"blue block\" and stack it on top of the \"orange block\" to elevate the structure further.\n5. Now, we can focus on the white stack. Pick up the \"white block\" and stack it on top of the \"blue block\" to continue our plan.\n6. The next step is to pick up the \"black block\" and stack it on top of the \"white block\", finalizing the white stack section of our goal.\n7. With that done, we pick up the \"gold block\" and stack it on top of the \"black block\", preparing the top of the entire structure.\n8. Finally, we move the \"green block\" by picking it up and stacking it on top of the \"gold block\", concluding the process according to the goal given.\n\nThis sequential series of actions will ensure all blocks are aligned with the target stacking configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up red)\n(stack red yellow)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange silver)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white blue)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black white)\n(pick-up gold)\n(stack gold black)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green gold)",

We need to sequentially pick up and stack the blocks, ensuring each block is clear before it is stacked upon.

The target stack sequences have multiple layers which necessitate handling multiple stacks emerging from the base blocks.\n\nHere is the inference step-by-step:\n\n1.

Proceed by picking up the cyan block and stack it on top of the violet block. This ensures that the cyan block is part of the stack.\n4. Continue by picking up the orange block and stack it on the cyan block, which will satisfy the goal condition of orange on cyan.\n5. Now, pick up the blue block and stack it on the orange block, meeting the goal of having blue on orange.\n6. Then, move on to pick up the gold block and stack it on the blue block, achieving the goal condition where gold is on blue.\n7. Next, pick up the red block and stack it on top of the gold block, which will satisfy the goal condition where red is on gold.\n8. Pick up the black block and stack it on the red block, completing the stack where black is on red.\n9. Move on by picking up the green block and stack it on the black block, satisfying the condition of green on black.\n10. Finally, pick up the white block and stack it on the green block, completing the stack where white is on green.\n\nEach action corresponds directly to a step needed to construct the desired stacks, ensuring all conditions are met.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(pick-up yellow)  \n(stack yellow silver)  \n(pick-up violet)  \n(stack violet yellow)  \n(pick-up cyan)  \n(stack cyan violet)  \n(pick-up orange)  \n(stack orange cyan)  \n(pick-up blue)  \n(stack blue orange)  \n(pick-up gold)  \n(stack gold blue)  \n(pick-up red)  \n(stack red gold)  \n(pick-up black)  \n(stack black red)  \n(pick-up green)  \n(stack green black)  \n(pick-up white)  \n(stack white green)",

        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE\n\nTo achieve the desired stack configuration, begin by stacking the blocks in the correct order. Since all blocks are clear and on the table initially, we can directly start stacking each block onto the appropriate block according to the goal sequence. First, stack the silver block on top of the yellow block, then place the gold block onto the silver block. Next, stack the cyan block on top of the gold block. Following this, place the blue block onto the cyan block. Next, stack the red block on top of the blue block. Finally, stack the white block on top of the red block. This will achieve the desired configuration: white (on top) -> red -> blue -> cyan -> gold -> silver (on top of yellow) and gold -> silver -> yellow. These steps ensure that each block is placed onto a clear block, adhering to the block-stacking constraints.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up silver)\n(stack silver yellow)\n(pick-up gold)\n(stack gold silver)\n(pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan gold)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue cyan)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white red)",

Our goal is to achieve the following stack configuration: orange on silver, yellow on green, magenta on gold, black on yellow, green on violet, violet on orange, silver on red, and gold on black.\n\n1. The plan begins by picking up the silver block and stacking it on the red block because silver needs to be the base for orange.\n2. Next, we pick up the orange block and stack it on top of silver, aligning with the requirement for violet to be on orange.\n3. We proceed by picking up the violet block and stacking it on orange, ensuring the correct order for subsequent blocks.\n4. Then, we pick up the green block and stack it on top of the violet block, as green needs to have yellow on it.\n5. Moving on, we pick up the yellow block and stack it on top of green, preparing for black to go on top of yellow.\n6. Next in line, we pick up the black block and stack it on top of yellow, securing the position for gold.\n7.

        "answer": "Inference: Our task is to arrange the blocks step-by-step according to the desired goal. Given the initial conditions that all blocks are clear and on the table, we have to perform each pick-up and stack operation one at a time. The plan involves stacking blocks in a specific sequence ensuring that the block on which another is to be stacked is clear. The ultimate objective is to form stacks: magenta on gold, gold on orange, orange on silver, silver on blue, blue on violet, violet on white, white on cyan, cyan on green, and green on black.

        "answer": "We start with an empty hand, and all blocks are clear and on the table. The goal configuration requires a specific sequence of blocks: yellow on orange, orange on magenta, magenta on red, red on violet, and violet on cyan. \n\nTo achieve this, I must first stack the violet block on the cyan block because the violet is clear and on the table, and the cyan is clear. After this step, the violet is not clear anymore, but the red, magenta, orange, and yellow blocks are all still clear and on the table.\n\nNext, I proceed by picking up the red block and stack it on the now-stacked violet block. The red block is no longer clear but the violet block becomes covered, while the magenta, orange, and yellow remain clear.\n\nI continue by picking the magenta block and stacking it on top of the red block. This action makes the magenta block on the red and the rest of the structure fulfills part of the endgoal. The red block becomes buried but the magenta now is still sittable. \n\nFollowing those steps, I grab the orange block, which is still clear, and stack it onto the magenta block, leaving the last step to stack the yellow block, now still clear and on the table, onto the orange block to achieve the final goal configuration.\n\nLastly, I stack the yellow block on the orange block completing the arrangement.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up violet)\n(stack violet cyan)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red violet)\n(pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange magenta)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)",

Silver should then be stacked on top of violet: silver -> violet -> green -> gold -> orange -> magenta -> cyan.\n   - (pick-up silver)\n   - (stack silver violet)\n\n7. Continue with white on top of the newly created stack: white -> silver -> violet -> green -> gold -> orange -> magenta -> cyan.\n   - (pick-up white)\n   - (stack white silver)\n\n8. Black should be stacked on top of white: black -> white -> silver -> violet -> green -> gold -> orange -> magenta -> cyan.\n   - (pick-up black)\n   - (stack black white)\n\n9. Blue goes on top of black: blue -> black -> white -> silver -> violet -> green -> gold -> orange -> magenta -> cyan.\n   - (pick-up blue)\n   - (stack blue black)\n\n10.

        "answer": "The task is to arrange the set of blocks into a specific stack order by performing legal actions under the provided constraints. We start with the initial conditions where each block is clear and on the table, and the hand is empty. The steps to achieve the goal while maintaining the constraints are as follows:\n\n1. **Ground Level:** \n   - Since the red block is on the table, and the violet block is clear, we first pick up the violet block and stack it on top of the red block.\n  \n2. **Second Level:**\n   - Next, we pick up the cyan block and stack it onto the violet block. Now, the base is red -> violet -> cyan.\n\n3. **Third Level:**\n   - Then, we pick up the yellow block and stack it on top of the cyan block, establishing the base further as: red -> violet -> cyan -> yellow.\n\n4. **Fourth Level:**\n   - After the yellow block, we pick up the blue block and stack it onto the yellow block. The stack sequence becomes red -> violet -> cyan -> yellow -> blue.\n\n5. **Fifth Level:**\n   - Finally, we take the orange block and stack it on the blue block, achieving the final goal of red -> violet -> cyan -> yellow -> blue -> orange.\n\nEach action ensures that constraints are maintained, i.e., the hand is empty before picking or unstacking, only clear blocks are picked, and blocks are stacked only onto clear blocks. \n\nFinal Answer: \n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet red)\n(pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan violet)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow cyan)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)",

        "answer": "The goal is to stack the blocks in a specific order, following the rules and constraints provided. Initially, all the mentioned blocks are on the table and are clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of them, and our hand is empty, which means we are ready to follow the plan steps. The desired stack sequence begins with the green block being the bottom-most stack, with blue on yellow and yellow on green. Concurrently, we aim to build another stack where white is on gold, gold is on violet, violet is on cyan, cyan is on magenta, and magenta is on blue within the stack atop green. With the hand empty, proceed with the actions:\n\n1. Pick up the yellow block and stack it on the green block, forming the base of a target stack. \n2. Next, pick up the blue block and stack it on top of the yellow block.\n3. Then, pick up the magenta block and stack it on top of the blue block. \n4. Following that, pick up the cyan block and stack it on the magenta block. \n5. Then, pick up the violet block to stack on cyan. \n6. Further, pick up the gold block to stack on the violet block. \n7.

Stack the magenta block on top of the black block (at this point, keep building upwards and avoid disrupting any existing structures as needed).\n3. Place the gold block on top of the magenta block. The magenta block's position makes it smoother to build on after its placement on the sequencing on top of the black.\n4. Place the yellow block on top of the gold block. The gold block sits firmly on top of the newly placed stack in relation to the magenta.\n5.

We'll proceed to do so, one step at a time, within the given rules.\n\n- Pick up the silver block and stack it on the violet block so that the silver block is atop.\n\n- Pick up the blue block and stack it on the silver block so that it lands atop the silver.\n\n- From there, the next goal is yellow atop blue. Pick up the yellow block and follow with stacking it above blue.\n\n- As we continue this sequence, focus gets shifted towards cyan stacking on yellow. Accomplish this by picking up cyan and placing it over yellow.\n\n- The ensuing sequence involves the stacking of black on top of cyan.
