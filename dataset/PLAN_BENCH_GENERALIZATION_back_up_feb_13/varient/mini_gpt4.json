The first condition is stacking the blue block on top of the black block, which means we first have to pick up the blue block and ensure that the black block is clear.\n2. Next, we need to stack the yellow block on top of the green block, which requires picking up the yellow block first, making sure the green block is clear.\n3. The white block needs to be stacked on top of the red block. We can pick up the white block and once the red block is clear, we can stack it.\n4. We need to stack the magenta block on top of the gold block, following a similar process of making sure it is clear to allow for stacking.\n5. The black block will then go on top of the white block, which requires picking up the black block after the white block is available to be placed upon.\n6.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of stacking the blocks according to the desired configuration, we need to carefully consider the constraints of picking up and stacking blocks.\n\n1. The starting configuration has all blocks clear and on the table:\n   - Red, Blue, Yellow, Magenta, and Cyan blocks are all clear and on the table.\n   \n2. The goal configuration requires:\n   - Red block on top of Blue block\n   - Blue block on top of Cyan block\n   - Yellow block on top of Magenta block\n   - Cyan block on top of Yellow block\n\n3. We can break down the required final structure:\n   - To get the Yellow block on top of the Magenta block first, we must pick up the Yellow block and stack it on the Magenta block.\n   - Next, since Yellow is now on Magenta, we can pick up Cyan and stack it on Yellow.\n   - We now have Yellow on Magenta and Cyan on Yellow.\n   - Now, we can pick up Blue and stack it on Cyan.\n   - Finally, we can pick up Red and stack it on Blue.\n\n4.

The initial statement informs us that all blocks (red, orange, yellow, magenta, black, green, violet, and gold) start as clear and are on the table.\n2. The final goal requires specific blocks to be stacked in a particular order: red on green, orange on magenta, yellow on red, magenta on yellow, black on orange, green on violet, and violet on gold.\n3. We strategize by ensuring we only perform actions with clear blocks, stack blocks only when holding them and the destination block is clear, and we always check if our hand is empty before picking up.\n\nFollowing this logic, we begin the series of actions:\n\n- Pick up the violet block (it's clear).\n- Stack the violet block on top of the gold block (now the gold block is no longer clear).\n- Pick up the green block (it's clear).\n- Stack the green block on top of the violet block (now the violet block is no longer clear).\n- Pick up the red block (it's clear).\n- Stack the red block on top of the green block (now the green block is no longer clear).\n- Pick up the yellow block (it's clear).\n- Stack the yellow block on top of the red block (now the red block is no longer clear).\n- Pick up the magenta block (it's clear).\n- Stack the magenta block on top of the yellow block (now the yellow block is no longer clear).\n- Pick up the orange block (it's clear).\n- Stack the orange block on top of the magenta block (now the magenta block is no longer clear).\n- Pick up the black block (it's clear).\n- Stack the black block on top of the orange block (now the orange block is no longer clear).\n\nWith these steps, we maintain adherence to the conditions set forth for stacking and achieve the goal state.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up violet)\n(stack violet gold)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green violet)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red green)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange magenta)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black orange)",

        "answer": "To achieve the final configuration where the blocks are arranged as described in the goal, we need to adhere to the stated actions and restrictions regarding stacking and unstacking. Starting from the initial conditions, we analyze the arrangement needed:\n\n1. The final arrangement requires the blue block to be on the violet block, the yellow block to be on the black block, the white block to be on the yellow block, the cyan block to be on the blue block, and the violet block to be on the white block.\n2. The first action is to pick up the yellow block since it is clear and not on top of any other block.\n3. Next, we stack the yellow block on the black block, which is also clear.\n4. Then we pick up the white block, as it is clear.\n5. We stack the white block on the yellow block, which is now not clear since it has another block on it.\n6. The next step is to pick up the violet block, as it is still clear.\n7. We stack the violet block on top of the white block, now creating a chain where the white block holds the violet block.\n8. After that, we proceed by picking up the blue block next since it is clear as well.\n9. We stack the blue block on top of the violet block, maintaining that the violet block is now non-clear due to having another block stacked on it.\n10. Finally, we pick up the cyan block, which is still clear and stack it on the blue block, completing the arrangement.\n\nPutting this together, we can summarize the steps as follows:\n\n1. pick up yellow\n2. stack yellow black\n3. pick up white\n4. stack white yellow\n5. pick up violet\n6. stack violet white\n7. pick up blue\n8. stack blue violet\n9. pick up cyan\n10. stack cyan blue\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow black)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white yellow)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet white)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue violet)\n(pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan blue)",

Orange block on blue block\n4. White block on green block\n5. Green block on orange block\n6. Violet block on white block\n\n1. **Pick up Blue**: We can pick up the blue block since it is clear and on the table.\n2. **Stack Blue on Magenta**: Now, stack the blue block on the magenta block. This operation is valid because we are holding the blue block, and the magenta block is clear.\n3. **Pick up Orange**: Next, we pick up the orange block, which is also clear and on the table.\n4. **Stack Orange on Blue**: Then, stack the orange block on top of the blue block. This is valid as the blue block is directly on top of the magenta block and is held in our hand.\n5. **Pick up Green**: Now, pick up the green block, which is still clear.\n6. **Stack Green on Orange**: Stack the green block on the orange block. This is valid as the orange block is clear (held blue block above it).\n7. **Pick up White**: Pick up the white block from the table, which is clear.\n8. **Stack White on Green**: Stack the white block on top of the green block, which is valid since green is clear.\n9. **Pick up Violet**: Next, pick up the violet block, which is also clear.\n10. **Stack Violet on White**: Stack the violet block on top of the white block. Since the white block is now held over the green block, this is a valid action.\n11. **Pick up Red**: Finally, pick up the red block, which is clear.\n12. **Stack Red on Violet**: Stack the red block on the violet block.

Initially, all blocks are clear. Therefore, we can start our plan with the silver block since it is the base for the orange block.\n\n1. Pick up the silver block \u2013 Allowed since it is clear and on the table.\n2. Stack the silver block on top of the blue block \u2013 Allowed as the blue block is clear and available as a base.\n3. Pick up the orange block \u2013 Allowed as it is clear and on the table.\n4. Stack the orange block on top of the silver block \u2013 Now the silver block has a block on top, making it no longer clear, but the orange block can be placed on it.\n5.

Start with all blocks (red, white, gold) being clear and on the table. Since the hand is empty, we can begin by picking up the white block.\n2. After picking up the white block, we can stack it on top of the red block, as the red block is clear and the hand is holding the white block.\n3. After stacking the white block on the red block, the red block is no longer clear. We now need to pick up the gold block, which is still clear on the table.\n4. Finally, we will stack the gold block on top of the white block.

It is essential to respect the clarity and positioning rules:\n   - The red block must end up on the green block.\n   - The blue block must be stacked on top of the gold block.\n   - The yellow block needs to be positioned on top of the blue block.\n\n3. **Sequence of actions**:\n   - Start by picking up blocks that will be at the bottom of the final arrangement first, ensuring that any block I need to place on top is also available to be picked.\n\n4. **Plan based on inference**:\n   - Initially, pick the white block to create the first stack (white on cyan).\n   - Then, the green block can be placed on the white block.\n   - Continue stacking the red block on the green.\n   - Sequentially, stack black on red, gold on black, blue on gold, yellow on blue, silver on yellow, orange on silver, and violet on orange.\n\nThis approach respects all stacking conditions and maintains clarity throughout the sequence.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up white)\n(stack white cyan)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green white)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red green)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black red)\n(pick-up gold)\n(stack gold black)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue gold)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange silver)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet orange)",

Next, we need to stack the magenta block on top of the orange block after picking it up, keeping track of the block states throughout. \n\nFrom there, we will work our way up through the other blocks as needed, ensuring that every block is either clear or appropriately stacked according to the restrictions provided.\n\nFollowing this reasoning, the steps can be broken down and finalized as follows:\n\n1. Pick up the orange block (it's clear and on the table).\n2. Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block (the yellow block is clear).\n3. Pick up the magenta block (it's clear on the table).\n4.

Next, I need to stack the red block on top of the black block. After placing the black block, I will pick up the red block (which is still clear) and stack it on black.\n3. Afterward, I will pick up the blue block and stack it on the red block, which is currently clear.\n4. Then, I will pick up the orange block and stack it on the blue block.\n5. Finally, I will pick up the silver block and stack it on the orange block.\n\nNow following the sequence clearly:\n\n1. Pick up the black block.\n2. Stack the black block on the white block.\n3. Pick up the red block.\n4. Stack the red block on the black block.\n5. Pick up the blue block.\n6. Stack the blue block on the red block.\n7. Pick up the orange block.\n8. Stack the orange block on the blue block.\n9. Pick up the silver block.\n10. Stack the silver block on the orange block.\n\nThus, my answer is structured clearly. \n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up black)\n(stack black white)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red black)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver orange)",

The first step is to pick up the black block, which is allowed since my hand is empty and the block is clear. \n3. Next, I will stack the black block on top of the red block. This is permitted because I am holding the black block, and the red block is clear. \n4. After this, I need to pick up the violet block. This is valid as it is on the table and clear.\n5.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of arranging the blocks according to the specified order, I will need to follow the restrictions and actions available. \n\n1. Start with an empty hand and acknowledge that all blocks are clear and on the table.\n2. The target arrangement requires specific blocks to be stacked on top of each other according to the rules.\n3. We need to pick up each block that is clear and stack it carefully on top of another designated block, ensuring that each action maintains the condition of having an empty hand after putting down or stacking a block.\n\nFollowing these steps logically, here is the plan:\n\n- Pick up the black block. (The black block is clear and on the table.)\n- Stack the black block on top of the cyan block. (Cyan block is clear.)\n- Pick up the white block. (The white block is clear and on the table.)\n- Stack the white block on top of the black block. (The black block is now not clear after stacking.)\n- Pick up the gold block. (The gold block is clear and on the table.)\n- Stack the gold block on top of the white block. \n- Pick up the magenta block. (The magenta block is clear and on the table.)\n- Stack the magenta block on top of the gold block.\n- Pick up the blue block. (The blue block is clear and on the table.)\n- Stack the blue block on top of the magenta block.\n- Pick up the red block. (The red block is clear and on the table.)\n- Stack the red block on top of the blue block.\n- Pick up the violet block. (The violet block is clear and on the table.)\n- Stack the violet block on top of the red block.\n- Pick up the green block. (The green block is clear and on the table.)\n- Stack the green block on top of the violet block.\n- Pick up the silver block.

Simultaneously, the blue block must end up on top of the red block.\n3. **Determine the necessary actions**: \n   - To stack any block, it needs to be clear and I must be holding it while ensuring the block I am stacking onto is also clear.\n   - Starting from the bottom, we need to ensure that blocks are stacked in a manner that respects these constraints.\n\nFollowing this logic, I'll carry out the necessary actions in this order:\n\n- Pick up the cyan block (it\u2019s clear).\n- Stack the cyan block on top of the white block (the white block is clear).\n- Pick up the gold block.\n- Stack the gold block on top of the cyan block.\n- Pick up the magenta block.\n- Stack the magenta block on top of the gold block.\n- Pick up the green block.\n- Stack the green block on top of the magenta block.\n- Pick up the orange block (it's clear).\n- Stack the orange block on top of the green block.\n- Pick up the yellow block (it's clear).\n- Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block.\n- Pick up the black block.\n- Stack the black block on top of the yellow block.\n- Pick up the red block.\n- Stack the red block on top of the black block.\n- Pick up the blue block (it\u2019s clear).\n- Stack the blue block on top of the red block.\n\nNow, I will present the final answer as required:\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan white)\n(pick-up gold)\n(stack gold cyan)\n(pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta gold)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green magenta)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange green)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red black)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue red)",

The goal stacking requirements can be adopted based on the actions we can perform sequentially.\n\n2. **Actions Breakdown:**\n   - **Pick up the green block:** This is allowed since it is clear on the table.\n   - **Stack the green block on top of the violet block:** The violet block is clear, so this stacking is valid.\n   - **Pick up the white block:** This is also allowed because it is clear and on the table.\n   - **Stack the white block on top of the green block:** The green block is currently on the violet block, which is also clear now supporting stacking.\n   - **Pick up the orange block:** This block is clear.\n   - **Stack the orange block on top of the white block:** This is valid as the white block is now on the green block which is clear.\n   - **Pick up the gold block:** The gold block is clear and able to be picked up.\n   - **Stack the gold block on top of the orange block:** The orange block is clear because it is on top of the white block.\n   - **Pick up the black block:** The black block is clear, so this is permitted.\n   - **Stack the black block on top of the gold block:** This is valid since the gold block is currently on the orange block.\n   - **Pick up the cyan block:** This is also clear.\n   - **Stack the cyan block on top of the black block:** This is valid as the black block is clear.\n   - **Pick up the silver block:** This is clear and can be picked up.\n   - **Stack the silver block on top of the cyan block:** This is valid since the cyan block is clear. \n\nFollowing the restrictions and verifying each step, we can arrange the blocks as desired.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up green)\n(stack green violet)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white green)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange white)\n(pick-up gold)\n(stack gold orange)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black gold)\n(pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan black)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver cyan)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the yellow block is on top of the gold block, and the gold block is on top of the red block, we must consider the initial conditions and the restrictions on the actions.\n\n1. The initial conditions state that the red, yellow, and gold blocks are all clear and on the table, and my hand is empty.\n2. Since the yellow block must ultimately be on top of the gold block, I must first pick up the gold block and stack it on top of the red block.\n3. Once the gold block is on top of the red block, it is no longer clear, but the yellow block remains clear since it is still on the table.\n4. Next, I can pick up the yellow block and stack it on top of the gold block, completing the goal configuration.\n\nNow, based on this reasoning, here\u2019s how I will execute the plan:\n\n1.

The red block is still clear after this action.\n   - Next, pick up the orange block. It\u2019s also clear.\n   - Stack the orange block on top of the silver block. Now, the silver block is not clear anymore.\n   - Afterward, pick up the violet block. It is clear.\n   - Stack the violet block on top of the orange block. The orange block is now not clear.\n   - Next, pick up the green block. It is clear.\n   - Stack the green block on top of the violet block.\n   - Then, pick up the yellow block. It is clear.\n   - Stack the yellow block on top of the green block.\n   - Pick up the black block. It is clear.\n   - Stack the black block on top of the yellow block.\n   - Then, pick up the gold block. It is clear.\n   - Stack the gold block on top of the black block.\n   - Lastly, pick up the magenta block.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal, I need to analyze the initial conditions and the desired final arrangement of the blocks step by step while adhering to the restrictions on block manipulation.\n\nThe initial configuration states that all blocks are clear and on the table. The first step involves picking up the blocks in a specific order based on the final arrangement. \n\n1. **Pick up violet**: The violet block is clear on the table.\n2. **Stack violet on cyan**: The cyan block is clear, so I can stack the violet block on it.\n3. **Pick up gold**: The gold block is clear on the table.\n4. **Stack gold on violet**: Since the violet block is now on top of cyan, I can stack the gold block on top of violet.\n5. **Pick up black**: The black block is clear on the table.\n6. **Stack black on gold**: The gold block is clear so I can stack the black block on it.\n7. **Pick up white**: The white block is clear on the table.\n8. **Stack white on black**: The black block is now stacked under the white block, and it's clear.\n9. **Pick up blue**: The blue block is clear on the table.\n10. **Stack blue on white**: The white block is now occupied and so it\u2019s no longer clear, but we can stack the blue block.\n11. **Pick up magenta**: The magenta block is clear on the table.\n12. **Stack magenta on blue**: Stacking magenta on blue as blue is now situated on white.\n13. **Pick up green**: The green block is clear on the table.\n14. **Stack green on magenta**: Magenta is clear on blue, so I can stack green on top of it.\n15. **Pick up orange**: The orange block is clear on the table.\n16. **Stack orange on green**: Green is clear on top of magenta, allowing me to stack orange.\n17. **Pick up yellow**: The yellow block is clear on the table.\n18. **Stack yellow on orange**: Orange is now occupying green's space, thus it\u2019s permissible.\n19. **Pick up silver**: The silver block is clear on the table.\n20. **Stack silver on yellow**: Yellow now occupies orange.\n21. **Pick up red**: The red block is clear on the table.\n22. **Stack red on silver**: Finally, stacking the red block on top of silver.\n\nAfter analyzing and going through the sequential actions while respecting the restrictions, I arrive at the following final plan:\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up violet)\n(stack violet cyan)\n(pick-up gold)\n(stack gold violet)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black gold)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white black)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue white)\n(pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta blue)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green magenta)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange green)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red silver)",

Pick up blue.\n10. Stack blue onto violet.\n11. Pick up silver.\n12. Stack silver onto blue.\n13. Pick up orange.\n14. Stack orange onto silver.\n15. Pick up gold.\n16. Stack gold onto orange.\n17. Pick up magenta.\n18. Stack magenta onto gold.\n\nFollowing these actions will achieve the goal configuration without violating any restrictions.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up green)\n(stack green black)\n(pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan green)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white cyan)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet white)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue violet)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange silver)\n(pick-up gold)\n(stack gold orange)\n(pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta gold)",

        "answer": "To arrange the blocks as specified, we start with a clear understanding of the current situation and the restrictions in place. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the plan based on the objectives:\n\n1. The black block needs to be placed on top of the silver block. We will first pick up the black block and stack it on the silver block.\n2. Next, we need to arrange the red block on top of the black block. Therefore, we will pick up the red block and stack it on the black block.\n3. The white block goes on top of the red block, so next, we will pick up the white block and stack it accordingly.\n4. The blue block must be placed on the white block, so we will pick it up next and stack it on the white block.\n5. We then need to place the orange block on top of the blue block, so we will pick up the orange block and stack it.\n6. After that, the magenta block goes on top of the orange block, so we need to pick it up and stack it on the orange block.\n7. Next, we must place the gold block on top of the magenta block, so we will pick it up and stack it.\n8. The green block is then needed on top of the gold block, so we will pick it up and stack it.\n9. The violet block goes on top of the green block. We will pick it up and stack it next.\n10. Finally, the yellow block must be added on top of the violet block, so we will pick it up and stack it.\n\nFollowing these steps adheres to all restrictions as they ensure that blocks are only manipulated when clear and in a correct stacking sequence.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up black)\n(stack black silver)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red black)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white red)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue white)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta orange)\n(pick-up gold)\n(stack gold magenta)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green gold)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet green)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow violet)",

Instead, we need to correct our subsequent actions to ensure we stack appropriately according to the goal.\n\nReassessing the targets:\n- The final stacking should have the following structure:\n  - Red block on top of cyan\n  - Black block on top of silver\n  - Violet block on top of red \n  - Silver block on top of violet\n\nFrom our goals, it looks like I should process these stepwise actions based on the state of the blocks after each stacking action.\n\nAfter checking through, the revised actions would be:\n1. **Pick up the red block**: Valid.\n2. **Pick up the violet block**: Valid (since after stacking red on cyan, I'll have hand empty).\n3. **Pick up the silver block**: Valid since the silver block is clear.\n4. **Stack the silver block on top of the violet block**: The violet block can be stacked upon since we have to then start from the bottom correctly, and finally:\n5. **Stack the black block on top of silver**: Retain the stacking order.\n\nFinal adjustments lead us to this sequence that fulfills the goal. \n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up red)\n(stack red cyan)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet red)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver violet)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black silver)",

        "answer": "To achieve the desired stacking of blocks, we need to follow the restrictions and actions defined. Starting from the initial conditions where all blocks are clear and on the table, we can deduce the following steps required to reach the goal state. \n\n1. Since the gold block needs to be on top of the white block and the white block is clear, we can pick up the gold block first.\n2. Next, we stack the gold block on the white block.\n3. The next goal is to stack the orange block on top of the gold block, so we pick up the orange block.\n4. Then, stack the orange block on the gold block.\n5. The next block to use is violet, which we can stack on top of the orange block. So we pick up the violet block.\n6. Stack the violet block on top of the orange block.\n7. Now, we need to stack cyan on top of violet. Thus, we pick up the cyan block.\n8. Stack cyan on top of the violet block.\n9. Next is the red block to be placed on top of the cyan block. We pick that up next.\n10. Stack the red block on top of the cyan block.\n11. The black block will be next; it goes on top of the red block. We pick it up next.\n12. Stack the black block on the red block.\n13. Then we will pick up the silver block to place it on top of the black block.\n14. Stack the silver block on the black block.\n15. Next, we need to stack the blue block on top of the silver block, so we pick up the blue block.\n16. Stack the blue block on the silver block.\n17. Yellow block goes next on top of blue. Pick it up.\n18. Stack yellow on top of blue.\n19. Lastly, we pick up the green block to stack it on yellow.\n20. Stack the green block on top of yellow.\n21. Finally, we will pick up the magenta block to stack it on top of green.\n22.

Now I have the red block in hand.\n2. **Stack the red block on the blue block:** The blue block is clear, so I can stack the red block on top of the blue block. Now the red block is on top of the blue block, but the blue block is no longer clear.\n3. **Pick up the silver block:** The silver block is clear since it is on the table. I can now pick it up.

After that, we will stack the blue block on top of the cyan block.\n7. We will then arrange the violet block on top of the blue block.\n8. The black block will be placed on top of the violet block.\n9. Finally, we will stack the gold block on the black block, then the red block on the gold block, the yellow block on the red block, and the white block on the yellow block.\n\nFollowing these steps will allow us to reach the goal configuration without violating any of the restrictions stated in our rules.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta silver)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange magenta)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green orange)\n(pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan green)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue cyan)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet blue)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black violet)\n(pick-up gold)\n(stack gold black)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red gold)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white yellow)",

        "answer": "To achieve your goal arrangement, we need to look at each block's initial conditions and how they can be manipulated based on the restrictions given.\n\n1. Start with the clear blocks on the table: blue, orange, yellow, white, green, and silver.\n2. The final goal requires stacking them in a specific order:\n   - blue on silver\n   - orange on white\n   - yellow on orange\n   - green on blue\n   - silver on yellow\n\n3. First, we can pick up the orange block because it is clear and on the table.\n4. Next, the orange block can be stacked on the white block since the white block is also clear.\n5. After that, we pick up the yellow block and stack it on the orange block.\n6. Now we acquire the silver block and stack it on top of the yellow block.\n7. Next, we pick up the blue block and stack it on the silver block.\n8. Finally, we pick up the green block and stack it on top of the blue block.\n\nFollowing this logical sequence of actions while respecting the restrictions provided will lead to the desired arrangement of blocks.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up orange)\n(stack orange white)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue silver)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green blue)",
