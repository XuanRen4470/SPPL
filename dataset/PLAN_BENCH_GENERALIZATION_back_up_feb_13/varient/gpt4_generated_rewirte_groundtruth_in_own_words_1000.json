        "answer": "To achieve the goal of stacking the blocks according to the specified conditions, we start with an array of clear blocks on the table. The strategy is to systematically pick up each block and stack it on another specified block while adhering to the constraints. \n\nFirstly, we must handle blocks that will have other blocks stacked upon them later in the sequence. Starting with the blue block, which should be on top of the yellow block, we pick up and stack it accordingly. Following this, the magenta block, destined to be on top of the blue block, is picked up and placed there. Next, the red block is picked up and stacked on top of the magenta block. \n\nSubsequently, to reach the desired arrangement, we pick up the black block and stack it on red, followed by picking up the violet block and placing it on top of the black block. Moving forward, the white block is picked up and stacked on top of the violet block. Next, the cyan block is picked up and stacked on the white block.\n\nThe sequence continues with picking up the gold block and stacking it on the cyan block. Following that, we pick up the silver block and stack it on top of the gold block.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of stacking the blocks in the desired order given the initial conditions, start with handling the block that will end up at the lowest level of your target stack. Follow the sequence of actions carefully, ensuring at each step that your hand is empty before picking up a block and that each block you want to place or stack on another is clear. \n\nFirst, pick up the yellow block since it will be placed directly on the violet block. Once that is accomplished, stack the yellow block on top of the violet block. Now, since your hand is free again, pick up the white block. Stack this block on top of the yellow block, creating the second layer of your desired configuration. Finally, pick up the black block.

The initial conditions have each block clear and placed on the table, ready to be picked up. Our objective is to arrange them into the desired stacks according to the specified goal. Steps will involve picking up a block, ensuring the block to be stacked on is clear, and stacking it. Let's go through the necessary actions step-by-step:\n\n1. Start by picking up the cyan block. Since cyan is initially clear and on the table, it's eligible to be moved.\n2. Stack the cyan block on the gold block. Once stacked, the gold block is no longer clear, but the action is successful.\n3. Pick up the blue block, which is clear and ready for stacking.\n4. Stack the blue block onto the cyan block, maintaining the sequence.\n5. Continue by picking up the green block, which is currently clear.\n6. Stack the green block on top of the blue block.\n7. Next, pick up the magenta block.\n8. Stack the magenta block atop the green block.\n9. Proceed to pick up the red block.\n10. Stack it onto the magenta block.\n11. Now, pick up the silver block.\n12.

        "answer": "To achieve the desired arrangement of blocks, the following tasks must be carried out in sequence according to the given restrictions:\n\nFirst, we need to pick up the yellow block from the table and place it on top of the magenta block. Since both blocks are initially clear and on the table, this first move is permitted.\n\nNext, once the yellow block is securely placed on the magenta block, we pick up the cyan block. Now, the cyan block, which is clear and situated on the table, can be stacked on top of the yellow block, thus fulfilling part of the goal.\n\nThe subsequent step involves handling the blue block.

Pick up the red block and stack it on top of the green block, aligning with the goal of having the red block atop the green block.\n\n3. Proceed by managing the yellow and red blocks. Pick up the yellow block and stack it on the red block to ensure the yellow block is positioned above the red one according to our goal.\n\n4. Now, concentrate on the white block. Pick up the white block and place it on top of the yellow block to fulfill the condition of having the white block above the yellow block.\n\n5. Move forward to the gold and white blocks. Pick up the gold block and set it atop the white block, meeting the requirement for the gold block to be above the white one.\n\n6. Direct your attention to the violet block afterwards. Pick up and stack the violet block on the gold block, attaining the target structure of the violet block on top of the gold block.\n\n7. For the silver block, follow by picking it up and stacking it on top of the violet block to meet the condition involving the silver block.\n\n8. Now, for the black and silver blocks, pick up the black block and position it on the silver block, which fits with the stipulating conditions.\n\n9. Finally, conclude the arrangement by handling the blue block. Pick it up and stack it on the black block, ensuring the blue block is correctly placed as specified in our goal structure.\n\nExecuting these steps fulfills each stacking condition in the correct order, ensuring each block is appropriately positioned without violating any action or stacking rules laid out in the task.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up green)\n(stack green orange)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red green)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white yellow)\n(pick-up gold)\n(stack gold white)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet gold)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver violet)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black silver)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue black)",

        "answer": "In this scenario, we need to create a stack of blocks in a specific order starting from the blocks on the table. Initially, all the blocks are clear, meaning there are no other blocks stacked on top of them, and the hand is empty, ready to pick up blocks. Here, the aim is to have the blue block on top of the violet block, which is on top of the gold block, which in turn is on top of the green block. \n\nTo achieve this goal, we should follow a series of actions consistent with the given restrictions on block manipulation:\n\n1. Begin by picking up the gold block because the gold block needs to be the lowest in the stack that is being built.\n2. Next, stack the gold block on top of the green block. This will create the foundation for the next layers of the stack with the green block remaining on the table as support.\n3. Then, pick up the violet block.\n4. Stack the violet block on top of the gold block. This positions the violet block correctly above the gold block.\n5. Proceed by picking up the blue block.\n6. Lastly, stack the blue block on top of the violet block. Now, the blue block will be the topmost block in this tower of blocks.\n\nThese steps will ensure that the blocks are stacked correctly according to the specified goal, while adhering to all the specified rules about block movement and stacking.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up gold)  \n(stack gold green)  \n(pick-up violet)  \n(stack violet gold)  \n(pick-up blue)  \n(stack blue violet)",

        "answer": "To solve the given problem, we need to systematically stack the blocks according to the specified goal while adhering to the rules and constraints of the actions that can be performed. The goal is to achieve a specific arrangement of blocks, stacked on top of each other in a particular order. \n\nConsidering the rules, we can only manipulate one block at a time, and each action must ensure that we maintain the requirement that our hand starts empty and can only hold one block at a time. Additionally, we can only stack a block onto another if the target block is clear, meaning no other blocks are on top of it. \n\nWe start with the given conditions where all blocks are clear and on the table. From this state, we'll perform a series of actions to reach the desired configuration:\n\n1. First, pick up the violet block and stack it on the magenta block since both are initially clear.\n2.

        "answer": "To solve the problem of arranging the blocks according to the given conditions, we will follow a sequence of picking up, stacking, and ensuring that the clear conditions are met at each step.\n\nInitially, all blocks are clear and on the table, and the hand is empty. Our task is to achieve a specific configuration where blocks are stacked as described in the goal. Here\u2019s how we can accomplish this:\n\n1. Identify the blocks that should be at the bottom of each desired stack in the goal. In the goal, the black block, the green block, the orange block, and the silver block serve as foundational blocks.\n2. Stack the yellow block on the black block to start forming one of the stack segments.\n3. Pick up the green block and stack it on top of the yellow block. This continues building the desired sequence.\n4. Next, stack the magenta block on top of the green block.\n5. Pick up the orange block and place it on top of the magenta block.\n6. Now, pick up the cyan block and stack it on top of the orange block.\n7. Place the silver block on top of the cyan block to finalize one of the complex stacks.\n8. Proceed to pick up the blue block and stack it onto the silver block.\n9. Pick up the white block next and stack it on top of the blue block.\n10.

Finally, pick up the silver block, ensuring your hand is empty, and stack it on the black block to complete the desired arrangement of blocks.

        "answer": "To achieve the desired stack configuration for the given set of blocks, we must perform a series of actions following the rules provided. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Start by picking up the orange block. Since the orange block is clear and your hand is initially empty, this action is permissible.\n\n2. Once holding the orange block, stack it on top of the yellow block. The yellow block is clear, so the orange block can be stacked on it.\n\n3. Next, pick up the magenta block. The magenta block is clear and your hand is empty after the previous stack action.\n\n4. Stack the magenta block on top of the orange block, since the orange block is clear.\n\n5. Move on to the silver block and pick it up because it is clear. \n\n6. Stack the silver block on top of the magenta block. The magenta block is clear, allowing you to perform this action.\n\n7. Next, pick up the blue block. Since it is clear, you can start this new action.\n\n8. Stack the blue block on top of the silver block. As the silver block is clear, this action is valid.\n\n9.

Stack the violet block on top of the white block, since the white block is clear.\n\n15. Next, pick up the cyan block. It is clear, so this action is possible.\n\n16. Stack the cyan block on top of the violet block. The violet block is clear, making this action valid.\n\n17. Finally, pick up the green block. Since it's the last clear block, you can perform this action.\n\n18. Stack the green block on top of the cyan block.

        "answer": "Initially, you've got a situation where all the mentioned blocks are clear and sitting on the table, with an empty hand. Your objective is to create a specific stack arrangement involving the red, blue, orange, black, white, and silver blocks. To reach the desired arrangement, you need to strategically pick up and stack each block on top of another in a precise order, using the following plan:\n\n1. Start by picking up the black block, since it's clear and on the table.\n2. Stack the black block on top of the white block, making the white block no longer clear.\n3. With your hand now free, pick up the red block next.\n4. Stack the red block on top of the black block, ensuring your hand is empty afterwards.\n5. Continue by picking up the blue block.\n6. Stack the blue block on the red block\u2014this will clear your hand again.\n7. Move on to pick up the orange block.\n8. Stack the orange block on top of the blue block, freeing your hand once more.\n9. Finally, pick up the silver block.\n10.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of stacking the blocks as described in the initial conditions and goals, the process begins by first addressing the silver and yellow blocks. With the conditions that all blocks are clear and on the table, you should start by picking up the silver block, which is clear and available to be moved. The silver block should be stacked on top of the yellow block. This ensures that the first part of the goal\u2014having the silver block on top of the yellow block\u2014is fulfilled.\n\nNext, pick up the gold block, which is still on the table and not obstructed. Stack the gold block onto the silver block. This action completes another requirement of your goal by having the gold block positioned on top of the silver block.\n\nProceed by picking up the cyan block. With no other blocks on top of it and being on the table, it is eligible to be moved. The cyan block should be stacked onto the gold block, thus positioning the cyan block on top of the gold block as per the objective.\n\nFollowing this, pick up the blue block, which remains clear and accessible on the table. Stack the blue block on top of the cyan block. This fulfills the requirement of placing the blue block on top of the cyan block as per the plan.\n\nThen, pick up the red block, which is clear according to the initial conditions. Stack the red block onto the blue block, thus satisfying the requirement of the plan to have the red block on top of the blue block.\n\nFinally, pick up the white block, which remains on the table and unencumbered by other blocks.

Pick up the black block and place it on top of the white block. This setup will allow us to work towards positioning the cyan block next.\n\n3. Since the cyan block is still clear, pick it up and stack it on the black block. Now, the orange block should be your focus.\n\n4. Pick up the orange block and stack it on the cyan block.

Following this, take the orange block from the table and stack it on top of the white block.

Since the black block is on the green block, it becomes the base for the white block.\n- We pick up the red block and place it on top of the white block. The white block supports the red block securely.\n- Moving on, we pick up the blue block and position it above the red block, creating a stable stack.\n- With the blue block in place, we pick up the magenta block and stack it on top of the blue block, following the intended order.\n- Then, by picking up the violet block, we add it on top of the magenta block, ensuring the correct sequence is maintained.\n- The cyan block is next. Once picked, we stack it on the violet block. Each block rests securely on the one below it.\n- We proceed by picking up the orange block and stacking it on the cyan block, continuing to follow the stacking pattern.\n- Finally, we complete the desired arrangement by picking up the gold block and placing it on the orange block, finalizing the goal configuration.\n\nUltimately, this strategy allows us to achieve the goal of having each block in the specified order, resting securely on the one below.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(pick-up black)\n(stack black green)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white black)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red white)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue red)\n(pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta blue)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet magenta)\n(pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan violet)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange cyan)\n(pick-up gold)\n(stack gold orange)",

        "answer": "To achieve the desired stacking of the blocks, we will perform a series of actions based on the given initial conditions and constraints. We start with all blocks clear and all on the table. Our goal configuration requires specific blocks to be stacked on top of each other as outlined in the problem. \n\n1. Begin by picking up the violet block as it's one of the first pieces to be stacked.\n2. Stack the violet block on top of the cyan block since the violet block's destination is above the cyan block.\n3. Pick up the gold block next because it needs to be placed on top of the violet block.\n4. Stack the gold block on top of the violet block to continue the stack.\n5. Move on to the black block by picking it up, preparing to stack it next.\n6. Stack the black block on top of the gold block, forming the lower part of a larger stack.\n7. Pick up the white block next, as it needs to be stacked above the black block.\n8. Stack the white block on top of the black block to create a new resting point.\n9. Focus next on the blue block by picking it up, as it is to be stacked atop the white block.\n10. Stack the blue block on top of the white block to continue upward.\n11. Move on to the magenta block by picking it up, which is destined to be above the blue block.\n12. Stack the magenta block on top of the blue block to advance the stack.\n13. Proceed by picking up the green block since it needs to sit atop the magenta block.\n14. Stack the green block on top of the magenta block, adding to the tower.\n15. Next, pick up the orange block as it is required above the green block.\n16. Stack the orange block on top of the green block to maintain alignment.\n17. Continue by picking up the yellow block, which needs to be placed above the orange.\n18. Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block to ensure correct positioning.\n19. Following the ordering, pick up the silver block, which is intended to be above the yellow.\n20. Stack the silver block on top of the yellow block.\n21. Finally, pick up the red block, the highest block on the silver, to complete the desired structure.\n22. Stack the red block on top of the silver block. \n\nEach action is executed while observing the rules that only allow manipulation of one block at a time and ensuring the blocks being stacked are clear. Throughout this process, when a block is placed on another, the block receives additional weight, making it non-clear for subsequent interactions until it's at the top of its designated stack. With a systematic approach, all specified block positions are achieved.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet cyan)\n(pick-up gold)\n(stack gold violet)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black gold)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white black)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue white)\n(pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta blue)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green magenta)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange green)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red silver)",

        "answer": "To reach the desired goal where the blocks are stacked in the specified order, the process involves selectively picking up and stacking blocks while adhering to the given constraints. You begin with an empty hand and blocks laid out clearly on the table. The order of operations is crucial to ensure that each block is stacked correctly as per the goal specification. You need to systematically pick up each block and place it on the appropriate one that is already part of the stack being built. The sequence begins by clearing and stacking lower levels, which will eventually support the upper blocks. By carefully stacking each block in the correct sequence, you achieve the specified stack structure:\n\n1. Start by picking up the black block.\n2. Stack the black block on top of the blue block.\n3. Pick up the violet block.\n4. Stack the violet block on top of the black block.\n5. Pick up the yellow block.\n6. Stack the yellow block on top of the violet block.\n7. Pick up the magenta block.\n8.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of arranging the blocks in the specified order, we begin by utilizing the allowable actions within the given restrictions. We will follow a step-by-step process to rearrange the blocks into the desired configuration.\n\nFirst, we need to establish a base with the orange block, as it needs to have several other blocks on top of it. To begin this arrangement, we pick up the silver block and stack it on top of the orange block. This position allows us to stack further blocks on top.\n\nNext, we focus on creating the stack starting from the silver block up to the red block. We pick up the cyan block and place it on top of the silver block. This will subsequently support the red block.\n\nWith the cyan block in place, we proceed by picking up the red block and stacking it on top of the cyan block. This completes the sequence of the silver, cyan, and red blocks.\n\nFollowing this, our attention shifts to the arrangement involving the black block. To achieve this, we pick up the black block and stack it on top of the red block. This forms a new stack involving the red block, further advancing our arrangement.\n\nNext, we need to establish the placement of the magenta block. Pick up the magenta block and position it on top of the black block. This will set up the structure needed for the white block.\n\nAfter the magenta block is in place, we pick up the white block and stack it on top of the magenta block. This final action on this side completes the sequence involving these blocks.\n\nFor the remaining blocks, we pick up the gold block and carefully stack it on top of the white block. This forms a part of the arrangement where the gold block serves as a base for more stacking.\n\nContinuing this stack, we pick up the green block and stack it on the gold block. The green block will support the final violet block in the sequence.\n\nFinally, the goal is completed by picking up the violet block and stacking it on top of the green block. This step ensures that all blocks are in the intended positions, achieving the desired configuration of the block arrangement.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver orange)\n(pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan silver)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red cyan)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black red)\n(pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta black)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white magenta)\n(pick-up gold)\n(stack gold white)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green gold)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet green)",

        "answer": "Given the problem, we need to arrange a set of blocks according to specific goals using allowed actions and adhering to the defined constraints. Initially, all blocks are clear and on the table, and the hand is empty. The tasks of picking up, stacking, and putting down blocks follow the established rules:\n\n- A block can only be picked up if it is clear and on the table.\n- A block can be stacked on top of another only if the block being stacked is held and the block underneath is clear.\n\nTo achieve the desired configuration, the sequence of actions must be as follows:\n\n1. Start by picking up the green block and stack it on the white block to meet the condition where the green block should be on top of the white block.\n2. Pick up the black block and stack it on the green block.\n3. Pick up the violet block and stack it on top of the black block.\n4. Pick up the magenta block and stack it on the violet block so that the magenta block is eventually on top of the violet block.\n5. Pick up the gold block and stack it on the magenta block.\n6. Proceed to pick up the silver block and stack it on the gold block, aligning with the goal where the silver block is on top of the gold block.\n7. Next, pick up the orange block and stack it on the silver block.\n8. Pick up the red block and stack it on the orange block.\n9.

        "answer": "Let's consider the problem. You have a set of blocks initially on the table, and each block is clear, meaning that no block has another block on top of it. Your hand is also empty, allowing you to pick up any clear block on the table. The goal is to create a specific stacking order of these blocks.\n\nFirst, you need to arrange the violet block on top of the magenta block. \n1. Begin by picking up the violet block, which is clear and available on the table.\n2. Stack the violet block on top of the magenta block, making the magenta block no longer clear. \n\nNext, arrange the white block on top of the violet block.\n3. Pick up the white block from the table.\n4. Stack the white block on top of the violet block, now neither the violet nor the magenta block is clear.\n\nFollowing this, move the blue block onto the white block.\n5. Pick up the blue block from the table.\n6. Stack the blue block on top of the white block.\n\nThen, stack the black block on top of the blue block.\n7. Pick up the black block.\n8. Stack the black block on top of the blue block.\n\nProceed by putting the yellow block on top of the black block.\n9. Pick up the yellow block.\n10. Stack the yellow block on top of the black block.\n\nNow, stack the cyan block on top of the yellow block. \n11. Pick up the cyan block.\n12. Stack the cyan block on top of the yellow block.\n\nFollowing the same process for the orange block, you stack it on top of the cyan block.\n13. Pick up the orange block.\n14. Stack the orange block on top of the cyan block.\n\nFinally, arrange the silver block on top of the orange block.\n15. Pick up the silver block.\n16.

Next, stack the violet block onto the black block. Both the violet block and the black block meet the necessary conditions for this action: you are holding the violet block, and the black block is clear.\n\n3.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of stacking the blocks as desired, start by addressing the bottommost blocks that need to be stacked first and work your way up. Here's the sequence of actions:\n\n1. Begin with the black block. Pick it up since it is clear and place it on the green block.\n2. Then, pick up the gold block and stack it on top of the black block. This ensures that the black block is no longer clear, and the stack begins to form.\n3. Next, take the silver block, lift it, and carefully place it on top of the gold block. The silver block will now be part of the forming structure.\n4. Sequentially proceed with the white block. Pick it up and stack it onto the silver block. The formation is gaining height.\n5. Move forward by selecting the yellow block. Pick it up and position it on top of the white block, facilitating the stack to expand.\n6. Now, pick up the magenta block and place it on the yellow block, contributing to the intricate arrangement.\n7. As you continue, turn your attention to the violet block. Pick it up and appropriately place it onto the magenta block.\n8. Focusing next on the orange block, pick it up and stack it on the violet block for further development of the structure.\n9.
