        "answer": "The initial conditions allow us to pick up any block that is clear and on the table since the hand is empty. We'll follow a systematic approach to stack the blocks according to the goal:\n\n1. The cyan block must be on top of the green block, and the green block is to be on top of the blue block. We will start with stacking these three blocks as they form a base for multiple stacks.\n   - Pick up the green block, which is clear and on the table.\n   - Stack the green block on top of the blue block, which is clear and on the table.\n   - Pick up the cyan block, which is clear and on the table.\n   - Stack the cyan block on top of the green block, making the stack cyan -> green -> blue.\n\n2. The next independent set involves stacking the white block on top of the cyan block and the violet block on top of the white block.\n   - Pick up the white block, clear and on the table.\n   - Stack the white block on top of the cyan block.\n   - Pick up the violet block, clear and on the table.\n   - Stack the violet block on top of the white block, forming violet -> white -> cyan -> green -> blue.\n\n3. Now we need to focus on the set involving red, gold, black, silver, and orange. The goal is to stack them as red -> gold -> black -> silver -> orange.\n   - Pick up the gold block, which is clear and on the table.\n   - Stack the gold block on top of the violet block.\n   - Pick up the red block, which is clear and on the table.\n   - Stack the red block on top of the gold block.\n   - Pick up the black block, clear and on the table.\n   - Stack the black block on top of the red block.\n   - Pick up the silver block, clear and on the table.\n   - Stack the silver block on top of the black block.\n   - Pick up the orange block, clear and on the table.\n   - Stack the orange block on top of the silver block, completing the whole structure.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up green)  \n(stack green blue)  \n(pick-up cyan)  \n(stack cyan green)  \n(pick-up white)  \n(stack white cyan)  \n(pick-up violet)  \n(stack violet white)  \n(pick-up gold)  \n(stack gold violet)  \n(pick-up red)  \n(stack red gold)  \n(pick-up black)  \n(stack black red)  \n(pick-up silver)  \n(stack silver black)  \n(pick-up orange)  \n(stack orange silver)  ",

Next, pick up the yellow block, which is clear, and stack it on the silver block, making silver not clear. With the hand empty again, pick up the cyan block, stack it on top of the yellow block, rendering yellow not clear. Finally, since the hand is empty, pick up the violet block and stack it on the cyan block, making cyan not clear.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up black)\n(stack black red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange black)\n(pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta orange)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver magenta)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow silver)\n(pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan yellow)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet cyan)",

The restrictions ensure that each block can only be manipulated if my hand is empty, and I can stack only if the target block is clear.

Each action requires that the block is clear and my hand is empty before picking up, ensuring that placing a block does not contradict the clear condition for additional stacks.

I plan to address each block in order, ensuring each step follows the given rules of stacking and holding blocks as follows.\n\nFirst, I see that green and magenta need to be stacked, so I pick up the green block and stack it on the magenta block. Next, silver must be stacked on green; I pick up silver and stack it on green. From there, I proceed to stack white on silver by picking up the white block and placing it on the silver block. The red block must be stacked on white next, so I pick up the red block and stack it on the white block. After that, I need to stack violet on red, so I pick up violet and stack it accordingly. Black needs to go on top of violet, so I pick up the black block and stack it on violet.

I then stack the black block on the gold block since I am holding the black block and the gold block is also clear. Next, to achieve the goal where the magenta block is on the black block, I pick up the magenta block, as it is clear and my hand becomes empty after stacking. I then stack the magenta block on the black block, meeting the condition. Finally, I pick up the cyan block when my hand is empty again and stack it on the magenta block to fulfill the final condition.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up black) (stack black gold) (pick-up magenta) (stack magenta black) (pick-up cyan) (stack cyan magenta)",

        "answer": "The initial clear condition allows us to proceed directly with picking up and stacking actions, following the goal sequence. Clearly, each block can be picked up and stacked in the order needed to fulfill the final goal, ensuring that each block below is stable and cleared by actions. Begin by picking up the blue block, which is vital for building the first required stack, following with the black block to stack on the blue. Continue the sequence by picking up and stacking the gold block on the black, followed by the orange on gold. The cyan block can then be picked up and stacked on orange.

        "answer": "The initial conditions list all blocks as clear and on the table, with a given empty hand. Each goal specifies where a block needs to be stacked, usually requiring the destination block to already have something stacked on top of it in sequential order. Considering the goals, blocks must be moved systematically to achieve all necessary conditions while adhering to the stacking restrictions and ensuring the hand is empty between each pick-up action. \n\nFirst, move the target block from the table or as a clear block, then stack it atop the closest required block following the order determined by the set goals and aware of any dependencies, ensuring clarity of the new position before continuing.

The blue block needs to be on top of the gold block, so we pick up the blue block and stack it on the gold block.\n4.
