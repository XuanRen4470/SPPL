Now the cyan block is on the black block, and the black block is no longer clear.\n\n3. **Pick up the violet block**: The violet block is clear and on the table. Now I am holding the violet block.\n\n4. **Stack the violet block on top of the cyan block**: The cyan block is on the black block, but since I unstacked it before, I will stack it on top of the existing blocks. Now the violet block is on the cyan block.\n\n5. **Pick up the red block**: The red block is clear and on the table. Now I am holding the red block.\n\n6. **Stack the red block on top of the violet block**: The violet block is holding the cyan block below.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the cyan block on top of the black block and the green block on top of the cyan block, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Verify the initial conditions:\n   - The black block is clear, meaning there are no blocks on top of it.\n   - The cyan block is clear, indicating it is on the table and has no blocks on top of it.\n   - The green block is clear, also on the table and has no blocks on top of it.\n   - My hand is empty, which allows me to pick up blocks.\n\n2. Start with the goal of stacking:\n   - First, I need to pick up the cyan block to place it on the black block. Since the cyan block is clear and my hand is empty, I can pick it up.\n   \n3. Stack the cyan block:\n   - After picking up the cyan block, I can stack it on the black block as it is clear.\n\n4. Next, I need to stack the green block on top of the cyan block:\n   - I will pick up the green block next since it is also clear.\n   - After picking it up, I will stack the green block on top of the cyan block.\n\nBy performing these actions sequentially, I will achieve my goal. \n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan black)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green cyan)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of stacking the blocks according to the specified configuration, we will follow a systematic process while adhering to the restrictions provided. We need to ensure that we can only manipulate a block when it is clear and that we are holding it.\n\n1. Initially, we confirm the clear status of all blocks: red, magenta, black, cyan, violet, and gold are clear, and our hand is empty.\n2. Our goal involves the following arrangement:\n   - Red block is on top of the black block.\n   - Magenta block is on top of the gold block.\n   - Black block is on top of the magenta block.\n   - Violet block is on top of the red block.\n   - Gold block is on top of the cyan block.\n\n3. Start by picking up the gold block, which is clear and on the table.\n4. Stack the gold block on top of the cyan block (now cyan is not clear).\n5. Next, pick up the magenta block, which is still clear.\n6. Stack the magenta block on top of the gold block (now gold is not clear and the stack of gold on cyan is formed).\n7. Next, pick up the black block, which is clear.\n8. Stack the black block on top of the magenta block (now magenta is not clear).\n9. Pick up the red block, which is clear.\n10.

Before we move the orange block, we should first pick it up since it is currently clear.\n\n3. After picking up the orange block, we will stack it onto the yellow block.\n\n4. Then, we will pick up the magenta block.\n\n5. The magenta block needs to be stacked on top of the orange block.\n\n6. Next, we will pick up the silver block, as it is also clear.\n\n7. We will stack the silver block on top of the magenta block.\n\n8. After this, we need to pick up the blue block.\n\n9. The blue block should be stacked on top of the silver block.\n\n10. Now, we turn to the black block, which is clear. We pick it up.\n\n11. The black block will be stacked on top of the blue block.\n\n12. Next, we pick up the white block.\n\n13.

        "answer": "To arrange the blocks according to the provided goal, I will go through the steps logically based on the initial conditions, the restrictions, and the requirements of the goal state. \n\n1. **Initial State Checking**: \n   - The yellow block, black block, cyan block, green block, and silver block are all clear and on the table.\n   - My hand is empty.\n\n2. **Goal State**: \n   - Yellow on black\n   - Black on green\n   - Cyan on silver\n   - Silver on yellow\n\n3. **Action Plan**:\n   - Start by picking up the black block. Now I hold the black block and my hand is not empty.\n   - Next, stack the black block on top of the green block. Now the green block is no longer clear, the black block is held by me, and my hand becomes empty.\n   - I can now pick up the yellow block since it is clear and on the table. Now I am holding the yellow block.\n   - I stack the yellow block on top of the black block. The black block is no longer clear now that the yellow block is on top of it.\n   - Now, I will pick up the silver block from the table. I am now holding the silver block.\n   - Next, I stack the silver block on top of the yellow block, which makes the yellow block no longer clear.\n   - I can now pick up the cyan block, which is still clear and on the table.\n   - Finally, I will stack the cyan block on top of the silver block.\n\nAfter performing these actions, the goal state is achieved. \n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up black)\n(stack black green)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow black)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver yellow)\n(pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan silver)",

        "answer": "Step by Step INFERENCE HERE\n\n1. The initial conditions state that the hand is empty and all blocks are clear and on the table. The goal puts constraints on how the blocks should be arranged.\n   \n2. The first action is to pick up the white block. The white block is clear and can be picked up. (pick-up white)\n\n3. Next, I stack the white block on top of the silver block. The silver block is also clear and the action is allowed. (stack white silver)\n\n4. Now, I need to pick up the cyan block. The cyan block is clear and on the table. (pick-up cyan)\n\n5. I stack the cyan block on top of the white block. This is permissible because the white block is also clear now that it has the silver block beneath it. (stack cyan white)\n\n6. Next, I pick up the blue block, which is clear and on the table. (pick-up blue)\n\n7. I stack the blue block on top of the cyan block. This is okay as the cyan block is clear with the white block on top of it. (stack blue cyan)\n\n8. Now I need to pick up the yellow block, which is also clear and on the table. (pick-up yellow)\n\n9. I stack the yellow block on top of the blue block. The blue block is clear because it has the cyan block beneath it. (stack yellow blue)\n\n10. Next, I pick up the violet block which is clear and on the table. (pick-up violet)\n\n11. I stack the violet block on top of the yellow block. The yellow block is clear because it has the blue block beneath it. (stack violet yellow)\n\n12. Now I will pick up the black block, which is on the table and clear. (pick-up black)\n\n13. I stack the black block on top of the violet block. The violet block is clear because it has the yellow block below it. (stack black violet)\n\n14. Lastly, I pick up the red block, which is clear and on the table. (pick-up red)\n\n15. I stack the red block on top of the black block. The black block is clear because it has the violet block below it.

        "answer": "1. Start with the initial conditions mentioned, confirming the clear status of the blocks and that the hand is empty. \n\n2. The goal is to achieve a specific configuration: yellow on black, magenta on green, black on gold, and gold on magenta. \n\n3. **Step 1:** Pick up the magenta block. This is possible because it is clear and on the table.\n\n4. **Step 2:** Stack the magenta block on top of the green block. The green block is currently clear, making this action valid.\n\n5. **Step 3:** Now, pick up the gold block. It is clear and on the table.\n\n6. **Step 4:** Stack the gold block on top of the magenta block. At this point, the magenta block is not clear, so the action is not valid because the magenta block is now under the gold block.\n\n7. **Re-evaluating the steps:** Let\u2019s try to make the gold block act as a base.\n    \n8. **Redo Step 3:** Pick up the black block instead. It is clear and on the table.\n\n9. **Redo Step 4:** Stack the black block on top of the gold block. The gold block is currently clear as nothing is stacked onto it yet.\n\n10. **Step 5:** Now, pick up the yellow block. It is clear and on the table.\n\n11. **Step 6:** Stack the yellow block on top of the black block. The black block is currently clear, so this action is valid.\n\n12. **Final re-evaluation:** The placement of magenta on green can be done as well. \n\n13. **Step 7:** Pick up the magenta block again (now clear on the green).\n\n14. **Step 8:** Stack the magenta block onto the green block, which is again valid because it is clear.\n\n15. **Final configuration achieved:** All goals in place with correct stacking and clarity.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta green)\n(pick-up gold)\n(stack gold magenta)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black gold)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow black)",

After picking up the gold block, our hand is not empty.\n\nStep 5: Next, we will stack the gold block onto the red block.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the yellow block is on top of the gold block and the gold block is on top of the green block, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**: \n   - The yellow block is clear (no blocks on it).\n   - The green block is clear.\n   - The gold block is clear.\n   - My hand is empty.\n\n2. **Action Plan**:\n   - Since the gold block is clear and I can only pick up a block with an empty hand, I will **pick up the gold block**.\n   - After picking up the gold block, my hand is no longer empty. I will then **stack the gold block on top of the green block**. Now, the gold block is on the green block, making the green block not clear anymore.\n   - Next, I will **pick up the yellow block** since it is currently clear.\n   - Finally, I will **stack the yellow block on top of the gold block**. This achieves the goal where the yellow block is now on top of the gold block, which in turn is on top of the green block.\n\n3. **Inference**:\n   - I ensured that all actions adhere to the restrictions of picking up and stacking blocks only when they are clear and with an empty hand when necessary.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up gold)\n(stack gold green)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow gold)",

The orange block is on top of the green block.\n2. The black block is on top of the cyan block.\n3. The cyan block is on top of the orange block.\n4. The green block is on top of the blue block.\n\nNow, let's consider how to achieve this through a series of actions:\n\n1. **Pick up the green block.** The green block is clear and on the table.\n2. **Stack the green block on top of the blue block.** The blue block is clear, making this action valid.\n3. **Pick up the orange block.** The orange block is clear and on the table.\n4. **Stack the orange block on top of the green block.** The green block is now not clear, but the orange block stacked on it establishes the required arrangement.\n5. **Pick up the cyan block.** The cyan block is clear and on the table.\n6. **Stack the cyan block on top of the orange block.** The orange block is held and newly established above the green block, making this valid.\n7. **Pick up the black block.** The black block is clear and on the table.\n8. **Stack the black block on top of the cyan block.** With the cyan block being clear (after stacking), this completes the process.\n\nFollowing these steps ensures the blocks are arranged as per the desired configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(pick-up green)\n(stack green blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange green)\n(pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan orange)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black cyan)",

Here\u2019s the step-by-step inference based on the plan:\n\n1. The first action is to pick up the blue block. The blue block is clear and on the table, so I can pick it up.\n2. Next, I will stack the blue block on top of the cyan block. The cyan block is clear, so this action is valid.\n3. I will then pick up the white block. The white block is clear and on the table.\n4. Since the blue block is now on top of the cyan block, which is clear, I will stack the white block on top of the blue block.\n5. I will pick up the orange block, as it is clear and on the table.\n6. Now, I can stack the orange block on top of the white block, which is also clear.\n7. I will next pick up the gold block. The gold block is clear and on the table.\n8. I will stack the gold block on top of the orange block. The orange block is now not clear, but it is a valid stacking action.\n9. Next, I will pick up the magenta block, which is clear and on the table.\n10. I will stack the magenta block on top of the gold block.\n11. I will now pick up the black block.

I can do that since the green block is now holding the magenta block, meeting the clear condition for the black block to be stacked.\n\nStep 5: Next, I can pick up the cyan block as my hand is still empty.\n\nStep 6: I will then stack the cyan block on top of the black block, which is allowable since the black block is clear.\n\nStep 7: Now, I pick up the violet block next.\n\nStep 8: After that, I stack the violet block on top of the cyan block.\n\nStep 9: Following this, I pick up the orange block.\n\nStep 10: I will stack the orange block on top of the violet block.\n\nStep 11: Next, I pick up the silver block.\n\nStep 12: I then stack the silver block on top of the orange block.\n\nStep 13: Finally, I will pick up the white block.\n\nStep 14: Stack the white block on top of the silver block. \n\nAll conditions are satisfied throughout the process and the final arrangement matches the desired goal.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up green)\n(stack green magenta)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black green)\n(pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan black)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet cyan)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange violet)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver orange)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white silver)",

Since the red block is clear, I pick up the white block.\n3. Now I stack the white block on top of the red block. The state is now: white on red.\n4. The hand is now empty again, so I can pick up the blue block next.\n5. I stack the blue block on top of the white block. The state is now: blue on white, white on red.\n6. With my hand empty again, I pick up the cyan block.\n7. I stack the cyan block on top of the blue block. The state is now: cyan on blue, blue on white, white on red.\n8. My hand is empty again, so I pick up the green block.\n9. I stack the green block on top of the cyan block. The state is now: green on cyan, cyan on blue, blue on white, white on red.\n10.
