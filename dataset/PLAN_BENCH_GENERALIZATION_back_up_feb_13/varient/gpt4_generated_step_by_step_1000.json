All blocks are clear, and the hand is empty. \n\n2. **Goal**: Arrange the blocks such that the red block is on top of the orange block, and the violet block is on top of the red block.\n\n**Step-by-Step Inference:**\n\n- **Step 1**: The red block is clear and on the table, and the hand is empty. Therefore, we can pick up the red block.\n\n  Action: (pick-up red)\n\n- **Step 2**: Now, we are holding the red block. The orange block is clear and on the table. Thus, we can stack the red block on top of the orange block.\n\n  Action: (stack red orange)\n\n- **Step 3**: Next, we evaluate the state: the violet block is clear and on the table, and the hand is empty again. Hence, we can pick up the violet block.\n\n  Action: (pick-up violet)\n\n- **Step 4**: Now, we are holding the violet block. The red block is on top of the orange block and is thus clear. We can stack the violet block on top of the red block.\n\n  Action: (stack violet red)\n\n**Final Configuration**: The red block is on top of the orange block, and the violet block is on top of the red block, achieving the desired goal.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet red)",

We need to place the gold block on top of the violet block. Both the gold and violet blocks are clear and on the table, so:\n   - Pick up the gold block\n   - Stack the gold block on top of the violet block\n\n2. Next, we need the blue block to be on top of the gold block. Since the blue block is clear and on the table, and the gold block is a clear surface after being stacked:\n   - Pick up the blue block\n   - Stack the blue block on top of the gold block\n\n3. The orange block needs to be on top of the blue block. The orange block is clear and on the table, and the blue block is clear after being stacked:\n   - Pick up the orange block\n   - Stack the orange block on top of the blue block\n\n4. The yellow block needs to be on top of the orange block. The yellow block is clear and on the table, and the orange block is clear after being stacked:\n   - Pick up the yellow block\n   - Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block\n\n5. The cyan block needs to be on top of the yellow block. The cyan block is clear and on the table, and the yellow block is clear after being stacked:\n   - Pick up the cyan block\n   - Stack the cyan block on top of the yellow block\n\n6. The silver block needs to be on top of the cyan block. The silver block is clear and on the table, and the cyan block is clear after being stacked:\n   - Pick up the silver block\n   - Stack the silver block on top of the cyan block\n\n7. The black block needs to be on top of the silver block. The black block is clear and on the table, and the silver block is clear after being stacked:\n   - Pick up the black block\n   - Stack the black block on top of the silver block\n\n8. The green block needs to be on top of the black block. The green block is clear and on the table, and the black block is clear after being stacked:\n   - Pick up the green block\n   - Stack the green block on top of the black block\n\n9. Finally, the magenta block needs to be on top of the green block. The magenta block is clear and on the table, and the green block is clear after being stacked:\n   - Pick up the magenta block\n   - Stack the magenta block on top of the green block\n\nAfter following these steps, we will have reached the desired configuration.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(pick-up gold)\n(stack gold violet)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue gold)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan yellow)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver cyan)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black silver)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green black)\n(pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta green)",

        "answer": "Step 1: The current state has all blocks clear and on the table, with the hand empty. The goal state specifies that the gold block should be on top of the black block. Since the gold block is clear and picked up first, we will pick up the gold block.\n\nStep 2: After the gold block is picked up, we can stack it on top of the black block since the black block is on the table and clear.\n\nStep 3: Next, the cyan block needs to be on top of the gold block. We pick up the cyan block, which is currently clear and on the table.\n\nStep 4: We stack the cyan block on top of the gold block as it meets the condition of being clear after stacking the gold block on the black block.\n\nStep 5: Next, the green block should be on top of the cyan block. We pick up the green block, which is currently clear and on the table.\n\nStep 6: We stack the green block on top of the cyan block because the cyan block is clear after being placed on the gold block.\n\nStep 7: The violet block needs to be on top of the green block.

        "answer": "To solve this problem step by step, let's analyze the goal conditions, the initial conditions, and how we can achieve the goal through a sequence of stack operations.\n\nStarting with all blocks clear and on the table, our tasks are as follows, in order of stacking (due to dependencies between stacks):\n\n1. Red on top of Magenta.\n2. Violet on top of Red.\n3. Silver on top of Violet.\n4. White on top of Silver.\n5. Black on top of White.\n6. Gold on top of Black.\n7. Blue on top of Gold.\n8. Yellow on top of Blue.\n9. Cyan on top of Yellow.\n10. Green on top of Cyan.\n11. Orange on top of Green.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Pick up the Red block:** Start by picking up the Red block because it is clear and we need to stack it first.\n\n2. **Stack the Red block on the Magenta block:** The Magenta block is clear, so stack Red on top of it.\n\n3. **Pick up the Violet block:** Violet is clear and needs to be stacked on Red, so pick it up.\n\n4. **Stack the Violet block on the Red block:** Stack Violet on top of Red since Red is now supporting only Violet.\n\n5. **Pick up the Silver block:** Silver is clear and should be the next one to be stacked on Violet.\n\n6. **Stack the Silver block on the Violet block:** Stack Silver on Violet.\n\n7. **Pick up the White block:** The next step is to stack White on Silver, so pick up White.\n\n8. **Stack the White block on the Silver block:** Stack White on Silver.\n\n9. **Pick up the Black block:** Now, pick up Black, as it's clear and needs to be the next in the stack order.\n\n10. **Stack the Black block on the White block:** Stack Black on White.\n\n11. **Pick up the Gold block:** To be stacked next, pick up Gold.\n\n12. **Stack the Gold block on the Black block:** Stack Gold on Black.\n\n13. **Pick up the Blue block:** Next, pick up Blue, as it is clear and ready to support Yellow.\n\n14. **Stack the Blue block on the Gold block:** Stack Blue on Gold.\n\n15. **Pick up the Yellow block:** Pick up Yellow to place it on Blue.\n\n16. **Stack the Yellow block on the Blue block:** Stack Yellow on Blue.\n\n17. **Pick up the Cyan block:** Pick up Cyan, which is the next block to be stacked.\n\n18. **Stack the Cyan block on the Yellow block:** Stack Cyan on Yellow.\n\n19. **Pick up the Green block:** The next in sequence is Green, so pick it up.\n\n20. **Stack the Green block on the Cyan block:** Stack Green on Cyan.\n\n21. **Pick up the Orange block:** Finally, pick up Orange to stack it on Green.\n\n22. **Stack the Orange block on the Green block:** Complete the stacking by placing Orange on top of Green.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(pick-up red)\n(stack red magenta)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet red)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver violet)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white silver)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black white)\n(pick-up gold)\n(stack gold black)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue gold)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan yellow)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green cyan)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange green)",

Since the red block is clear and on the table, and the hand is empty, we can pick up the red block.\n\nStep 3: With the red block in hand, we can stack it on the gold block because the gold block is clear.\n\nStep 4: Next, we need the cyan block to be on top of the red block. The cyan block is clear and on the table, and the hand is empty, so we pick up the cyan block.\n\nStep 5: With the cyan block in hand, we stack it on the red block since the red block is clear after the prior stacking.\n\nStep 6: Finally, we need to stack the yellow block on top of the cyan block. The yellow block is clear and on the table, so we pick up the yellow block.\n\nStep 7: With the yellow block in hand, we stack it on the cyan block because the cyan block is clear.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up red)\n(stack red gold)\n(pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow cyan)",

Next, the cyan block needs to be on top of the black block:\n      - Pick up the cyan block.\n      - Stack the cyan block on top of the black block.\n\n   c. The orange block is to be placed on top of the cyan block:\n      - Pick up the orange block.\n      - Stack the orange block on top of the cyan block.\n\n   d. Finally, the gold block must be placed on top of the orange block:\n      - Pick up the gold block.\n      - Stack the gold block on top of the orange block.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up black)\n(stack black red)\n(pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan black)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange cyan)\n(pick-up gold)\n(stack gold orange)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal state for the blocks, let's analyze the plan step by step based on the initial conditions and constraints provided.\n\n1. We have the initial conditions where all blocks are clear and on the table, and the hand is empty. The task involves stacking blocks in a specific order to achieve the desired arrangement.\n\n2. Start with the lowest sequence:\n    - The magenta block is on the table and can serve as a base since it won't have any other blocks under it in the goal state. \n    - The cyan block needs to be on top of the magenta block. Since the cyan block is clear and the hand is empty, we can pick up the cyan block.\n\n3. Pick up the cyan block:\n    - (pick-up cyan)\n\n4. Stack the cyan block on top of the magenta block:\n    - (stack cyan magenta)\n\n5. Now, the yellow block is clear and needs to be on top of the cyan block, so we pick it up:\n    - (pick-up yellow)\n\n6. Stack the yellow block on top of the cyan block:\n    - (stack yellow cyan)\n\n7. The orange block, which is now clear, needs to go on top of the yellow block, so we pick it up:\n    - (pick-up orange)\n\n8. Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block:\n    - (stack orange yellow)\n\n9. The violet block should be on top of the orange block, so we pick up the violet block:\n    - (pick-up violet)\n\n10. Stack the violet block on top of the orange block:\n    - (stack violet orange)\n\n11. The red block, which is now clear, needs to go on top of the violet block, so we pick it up:\n    - (pick-up red)\n\n12. Stack the red block on top of the violet block:\n    - (stack red violet)\n\n13. Now, the silver block needs to be on top of the red block, so we pick it up:\n    - (pick-up silver)\n\n14. Stack the silver block on top of the red block:\n    - (stack silver red)\n\n15. Finally, the blue block, which should be on top of the silver block, is clear, so we pick it up:\n    - (pick-up blue)\n\n16.

The hand is empty, allowing us to perform a pick-up action. \n\n2. Action: Pick up the orange block. Now the orange block is being held and is no longer on the table, and the hand is no longer empty.\n\n3. Target configuration: The orange block needs to be stacked on top of the magenta block. The magenta block is clear, which makes it a valid stack destination.\n\n4. Action: Stack the orange block on top of the magenta block. Now, the orange block is not in hand, the hand is empty again, and the magenta block is no longer clear due to the orange block on top of it.\n\n5. Initial conditions after stack: The violet block is clear and on the table, and the hand is empty. \n\n6. Action: Pick up the violet block. The violet block is no longer clear, it's in hand and no longer on the table, and the hand is not empty anymore.\n\n7. Target configuration: The violet block needs to be on top of the orange block. Since \"putting an object on\" is typically \"stacking,\" the orange block must be clear to accept the violet block on top of it, which it is.\n\n8. Action: Stack the violet block on top of the orange block. The violet block is stacked, thus the orange block is no longer clear, and the hand is empty again.\n\n9. Conditions: The silver block is clear and can be picked up since the hand is empty again. \n\n10. Action: Pick up the silver block. Now, the silver block is held, and the silver block is no longer clear, and the hand is no longer empty.\n\n11. Target configuration: The silver block should be stacked on top of the violet block. The violet block is clear, making it a valid stack destination.\n\n12. Action: Stack the silver block on top of the violet block. Now, the silver block is no longer in hand, and the hand becomes empty.\n\n13. Conditions: The black block is clear and can be picked up since the hand is empty again.\n\n14. Action: Pick up the black block. Now, the black block is held, and the black block is no longer clear, and the hand is no longer empty.\n\n15.

The hand is empty, so we can pick it up.\n\n2. **Stack the silver block on top of the red block:**\n   - The silver block is being held, and the red block is clear. Therefore, we can stack the silver block onto the red block. Now, the silver block is no longer clear.\n\n3. **Pick up the black block:**\n   - The black block is clear and on the table. The hand is empty (after stacking the silver block), so we can pick it up.\n\n4. **Stack the black block on top of the silver block:**\n   - The black block is being held, and since we stacked the silver block earlier, it is currently clear. Thus, we can stack the black block on the silver block.\n\nBy following these steps, the goal condition is achieved.\n\nFinal Answer:\n((pick-up silver)\n(stack silver red)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black silver)\n)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal, we need to assemble the stack in the correct order given the constraints on moving blocks. We can start by visualizing a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Build the stack bottom to top**: \n   - We recognize that the goal is to have the structure with the white block, black block, and green block each stacked on top of another block. Thus, we can look to build smaller structures and integrate them.\n\n2. **Focus on green and magenta blocks first**: \n   - Since the green block has to be eventually under another structure, start by picking up the green block and stacking it on the magenta block as neither is required for direct structure on top.\n\n3. **Integrate silver over the new structure**:\n   - Following, it makes sense to pick up the silver block (since it is clear) and add it over the green-magent structure because, in the final goal, it holds the white block which is near the base.\n\n4. **Build the white-silver structure**:\n   - Pick-up the white block, stack it on the silver. This sets up the white, silver, green, and magenta part correctly.\n\n5. **Continue building with the red block**:\n   - The red block, which is clear, should now be stacked on the white block. As per our starting conditions, this is feasible.\n\n6. **Shift attention to violet and red blocks**:\n   - For the violet structure under black, pick-up the violet block and stack on what we've built so far (over red), respecting what has already been accomplished.\n\n7. **Position the black block**:\n   - Next, the black block, which must go over violet, is picked up and stacked over the current structure containing red-violet relation.\n\n8. **Finish configuration with orange**:\n   - Finally, the orange block is placed on the black block, completing the structure as every block is now positioned according to the final goal.\n\nStep by Step INFERENCE:\n- Pick up green, stack on magenta.\n- Pick up silver, stack on green.\n- Pick up white, stack on silver.\n- Pick up red, stack on white.\n- Pick up violet, stack on red.\n- Pick up black, stack on violet.\n- Pick up orange, stack on black.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green magenta)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver green)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white silver)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red white)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet red)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black violet)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange black)",

Now continue to build upwards:\n   - Violet should be on top of red: Pick-up the violet block, currently clear and on the table, then stack it on top of the red block, which was just stacked on the cyan.\n\n5. Next layer up:\n   - Green should be on top of violet: Pick-up the green block, clear on the table, and stack it on top of the violet block.\n\n6. Further build upwards:\n   - Yellow should be on top of green: Pick-up the yellow block, clear on the table, and stack on top of the green block.\n\n7. Finally, the top layer:\n   - Magenta should be on top of yellow: Pick-up the magenta block, clear on the table, and stack it on the yellow.\n\n8. This sequence of actions achieves the goal conditions as specifically outlined.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(pick-up red)\n(stack red cyan)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet red)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green violet)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow green)\n(pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta yellow)",

Let's start the sequence:\n\n   - **Pick Up & Stack**:\n     - Block `white` is clear and on the table, so `pick-up white`\n     - Stack `white` on `blue` because we want `white` on `blue`: `stack white blue`\n\n   - `Black` is clear and on the table, so `pick-up black`\n   - Stack `black` on `white` because we want `black` on `white`: `stack black white`\n\n   - `Red` is clear and on the table, so `pick-up red`\n   - Stack `red` on `black` because we want `red` on `black`: `stack red black`\n\n   - `Violet` is clear and on the table, so `pick-up violet`\n   - Stack `violet` on `red` because we want `violet` on `red`: `stack violet red`\n\n4.

        "answer": "To solve the problem step by step, we'll translate the goal into the required set of actions given the conditions and restrictions.\n\n### Current Situation:\n- Initial clear and available blocks: white, magenta, cyan, green, violet.\n- The hand is initially empty.\n- The table configuration includes each block being separate and clear.\n\n### Goal Situation:\n1. Violet on top of Cyan\n2. White on top of Violet\n3. Magenta on top of White\n4. Green on top of Magenta\n\n### Steps to Achieve the Goal:\n\n1. **Pick Up and Stack Violet on Cyan**\n   - With the hand empty, pick up the violet block which is clear.\n   - Stack the violet block on top of the cyan block. This makes the cyan block no longer clear.\n\n2. **Pick Up and Stack White on Violet**\n   - With the hand empty, pick up the white block which is clear.\n   - Stack the white block on top of the violet block. The white block becomes unstackable after this move.\n\n3. **Pick Up and Stack Magenta on White**\n   - With the hand empty, pick up the magenta block which is clear.\n   - Stack the magenta block on top of the white block. The magenta block becomes part of a stack now.\n\n4. **Pick Up and Stack Green on Magenta**\n   - With the hand empty, pick up the green block which is clear.\n   - Stack the green block on top of the magenta block.\n\n### Results:\n\nIn each step, by following the restrictions and picking only clear blocks, we arrange the blocks as required based on the goal outlined. We ensure that each stacking operation is valid because we pick a block when it's clear and place it on another block if that block is clear. These careful steps ensure that we reach the goal configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: \n```\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet cyan)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white violet)\n(pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta white)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green magenta)\n```",

This is possible because the orange block is on the table and clear.\n   - **Action**: Stack the orange block on top of the cyan block. The cyan block is on the table and clear.\n\n2. **Goal 2**: White block on top of the orange block (and thus, the orange block must remain on top of the cyan block).\n   - **Action**: Pick up the white block. This is possible because the white block is on the table and clear.\n   - **Action**: Stack the white block on top of the orange block. The orange block is now not clear, but it was clear when we needed it to perform the stack.\n\n3. **Goal 3**: Red block on top of the white block.\n   - **Action**: Pick up the red block. This is possible because the red block is on the table and clear.\n   - **Action**: Stack the red block on top of the white block. The white block remains clear for this action.\n\n4. **Goal 4**: Violet block on top of the red block.\n   - **Action**: Pick up the violet block. This is possible because the violet block is on the table and clear.\n   - **Action**: Stack the violet block on top of the red block.

We will utilize the available actions to achieve the desired stack configuration. Let's go through the plan step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**: All blocks (red, blue, yellow, white, cyan, green, violet, silver) are clear and on the table, with the hand empty.\n\n2. **Goal Configuration**:\n   - Red on Silver\n   - Blue on Cyan\n   - Yellow on Blue\n   - Cyan on Red\n   - Green on Violet\n   - Violet on Yellow\n   - Silver on White\n\n3. **Steps**:\n   \n   - Begin by handling the **Silver** block:\n     - **Pick up the silver block**: The silver block is clear and on the table. After picking it up, I'm holding the silver block.\n     - **Stack the silver block on top of the white block**: The white block is clear, so this action is permissible. Now, the silver block is on the white block, and the hand is empty.\n\n   - Handle the **Red** block next:\n     - **Pick up the red block**: The red block is clear and on the table. After picking it up, I'm holding the red block.\n     - **Stack the red block on top of the silver block**: The silver block is clear (on top of the white block), so this action succeeds. Now, the red block is on the silver block, and the hand is empty.\n\n   - Now to the **Cyan** block:\n     - **Pick up the cyan block**: The cyan block is clear and on the table. Now, I'm holding the cyan block.\n     - **Stack the cyan block on top of the red block**: The red block is clear, so stacking is allowed. Now, the cyan block is on the red block, and the hand is empty.\n\n   - Move on to the **Blue** block:\n     - **Pick up the blue block**: The blue block is clear and on the table. Now, I'm holding the blue block.\n     - **Stack the blue block on top of the cyan block**: The cyan block is clear, allowing this action. Now, the blue block is on the cyan block, and the hand is empty.\n\n   - Next, take care of the **Yellow** block:\n     - **Pick up the yellow block**: The yellow block is clear and on the table. Now, I'm holding the yellow block.\n     - **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block**: The blue block is clear, allowing this action. Now, the yellow block is on the blue block, and the hand is empty.\n\n   - Proceed with the **Violet** block:\n     - **Pick up the violet block**: The violet block is clear and on the table. Now, I'm holding the violet block.\n     - **Stack the violet block on top of the yellow block**: The yellow block is clear, so this action is allowed. Now, the violet block is on the yellow block, and the hand is empty.\n\n   - Lastly, address the **Green** block:\n     - **Pick up the green block**: The green block is clear and on the table. Now, I'm holding the green block.\n     - **Stack the green block on top of the violet block**: The violet block is clear, permitting this action.

        "answer": "Step by Step INFERENCE HERE:\n\n1. Start with the initial conditions: The hand is empty, and all blocks (red, blue, orange, yellow, white, magenta, black, cyan, green, violet, silver, and gold) are clear and on the table.\n\n2. To meet the goal, we need to create several stacks, as specified.\n\n3. The first step of our plan is to place the white block on top of the red block:\n   - **Action:** (pick-up white) \u2014 the hand is empty, and the white block is clear and on the table.\n   - **Action:** (stack white red) \u2014 stack the white block on top of the red block, making the red block no longer clear.\n\n4. Now, place the blue block on top of the white block:\n   - **Action:** (pick-up blue) \u2014 the hand is empty, and the blue block is clear and on the table.\n   - **Action:** (stack blue white) \u2014 stack the blue block on top of the white block, making the white block no longer clear.\n\n5. Next, place the magenta block on top of the blue block:\n   - **Action:** (pick-up magenta) \u2014 the hand is empty, and the magenta block is clear and on the table.\n   - **Action:** (stack magenta blue) \u2014 stack the magenta block on top of the blue block, making the blue block no longer clear.\n\n6. Then, stack the silver block on top of the magenta block:\n   - **Action:** (pick-up silver) \u2014 the hand is empty, and the silver block is clear and on the table.\n   - **Action:** (stack silver magenta) \u2014 stack the silver block on top of the magenta block, making the magenta block no longer clear.\n\n7. For the next goal, stack the cyan block on top of the silver block:\n   - **Action:** (pick-up cyan) \u2014 the hand is empty, and the cyan block is clear and on the table.\n   - **Action:** (stack cyan silver) \u2014 stack the cyan block on top of the silver block, making the silver block no longer clear.\n\n8. Then, place the black block on top of the cyan block:\n   - **Action:** (pick-up black) \u2014 the hand is empty, and the black block is clear and on the table.\n   - **Action:** (stack black cyan) \u2014 stack the black block on top of the cyan block, making the cyan block no longer clear.\n\n9. Next, place the violet block on top of the black block:\n   - **Action:** (pick-up violet) \u2014 the hand is empty, and the violet block is clear and on the table.\n   - **Action:** (stack violet black) \u2014 stack the violet block on top of the black block, making the black block no longer clear.\n\n10. Now, place the yellow block on top of the violet block:\n    - **Action:** (pick-up yellow) \u2014 the hand is empty, and the yellow block is clear and on the table.\n    - **Action:** (stack yellow violet) \u2014 stack the yellow block on top of the violet block, making the violet block no longer clear.\n\n11.

        "answer": "First, we analyze the initial conditions and the goal:\n\n1. Initial conditions: \n   - All blocks are clear and on the table. \n   - The hand is empty.\n\n2. Goal arrangement:\n   - red block on top of violet block.\n   - blue block on top of gold block.\n   - orange block on top of silver block.\n   - yellow block on top of orange block.\n   - white block on top of black block.\n   - magenta block on top of yellow block.\n   - green block on top of blue block.\n   - violet block on top of white block.\n   - silver block on top of red block.\n   - gold block on top of magenta block.\n\nNow, let's solve the problem step by step:\n\nStep 1: Pick up the white block. Since the white block is clear and on the table, and the hand is empty, we can pick it up.\nStep 2: Stack the white block on top of the black block. The black block is clear (on the table with nothing on top), so we can stack the white block on it. This clears the hand.\n  \nStep 3: Pick up the violet block. The violet block is clear and on the table, and the hand is empty, so we can pick it up.\nStep 4: Stack the violet block on top of the white block. This is allowed since the white block is now clear (with nothing on top), and the hand is holding the violet block.\n\nStep 5: Pick up the red block. The red block is clear and on the table. The hand is empty, so we can pick it up.\nStep 6: Stack the red block on top of the violet block. This move is valid because the violet block is clear. The hand is empty after this.\n\nStep 7: Pick up the silver block. The silver block is clear and on the table, and the hand is empty, so it can be picked up.\nStep 8: Stack the silver block on top of the red block. Since the red block is clear, the silver block can be stacked on top.\n\nStep 9: Pick up the orange block. Since the orange block is clear and on the table, with an empty hand, it can be picked up.\nStep 10: Stack the orange block on top of the silver block. This is valid because the silver block is clear.\n\nStep 11: Pick up the yellow block. The yellow block is clear and on the table, and the hand is empty, allowing it to be picked up.\nStep 12: Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block. Since the orange block is clear, it allows this action.\n\nStep 13: Pick up the magenta block. The magenta block is clear and on the table, and the hand is empty.\nStep 14: Stack the magenta block on top of the yellow block. The yellow block is clear, so this is valid.\n\nStep 15: Pick up the gold block. With it being clear on the table and an empty hand, it can be picked up.\nStep 16: Stack the gold block on top of the magenta block. This action is permissible because the magenta block is clear.\n\nStep 17: Pick up the blue block. The blue block is clear and on the table, and the empty hand allows it to be picked up.\nStep 18: Stack the blue block on top of the gold block. The gold block is now clear, allowing this action.\n\nStep 19: Pick up the green block. The green block is clear and on the table, and with an empty hand, it can be picked up.\nStep 20: Stack the green block on top of the blue block. This is allowed as the blue block is clear.\n\nFinal arrangement checks with the goal. \n\nFinal Answer: \n(pick-up white)\n(stack white black)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet white)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red violet)\n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange silver)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta yellow)\n(pick-up gold)\n(stack gold magenta)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue gold)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green blue)",

To achieve the goal, let's start by stacking blocks from the bottom up for the stack involving cyan, yellow, and blue. \n   - Pick up the cyan block (since it's clear and the hand is empty) and stack it on the yellow block (since the yellow block is clear). \n   - Now the cyan block is on top of the yellow block, and the hand is empty.\n\n2. Next, continue with the blue block: \n   - Pick up the blue block (since it's clear and the hand is empty) and stack it on the cyan block (since the cyan block is clear). \n   - Now, the blue block is on top of the cyan block, which is on top of the yellow block, and the hand is empty.\n\n3. Now, let's handle the stack involving violet and green. Starting with the green block and violet block:\n   - Pick up the violet block (since it's clear and the hand is empty) and stack it on the blue block (since the blue block is clear). \n   - Now, the violet block is on top of the blue block, and the hand is empty.\n\n4.

Now, the red block is no longer clear.\n   \n   - **Step 3:** Pick up the cyan block (it is clear and on the table) so that I can place it on the already positioned violet block.\n   - **Step 4:** Stack the cyan block on top of the violet block. Now, the violet block is no longer clear.\n   \n   - **Step 5:** Pick up the yellow block (it is clear and on the table) and stack it on top of the cyan block.\n   - **Step 6:** Stack the yellow block on top of the cyan block. Now, the cyan block is no longer clear.\n   \n   - **Step 7:** Pick up the blue block (it is clear and on the table) and stack it on top of the yellow block.\n   - **Step 8:** Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block. Now, the yellow block is no longer clear.\n   \n   - **Step 9:** Pick up the orange block (it is clear and on the table) and stack it on top of the blue block.\n   - **Step 10:** Stack the orange block on top of the blue block.

The cyan block, silver block, and gold block are all on the table.\n\n2. The goal is to have the cyan block on top of the gold block and the silver block on top of the cyan block.\n\n3. Since the cyan block is clear and my hand is empty, I can pick up the cyan block. \n   - Action: (pick-up cyan)\n\n4. After picking up the cyan block, my hand is no longer empty. I need to stack the cyan block on the gold block.\n\n5. The gold block is clear (since it's on the table and has no blocks on top). I stack the cyan block on the gold block. \n   - Action: (stack cyan gold)\n\n6. Now the cyan block is on the gold block, and my hand is empty again. Next, I need to pick up the silver block.\n\n7.

The cyan block is no longer clear since it is on top of the gold block, but the hand is holding the silver block, which can be stacked on a clear block. Since it is the step where we place the silver on top, I will assume there is an unintentional omission. Let's perform the action.\n   - Action: (stack silver cyan)\n\n10.

        "answer": "Initially, all the blocks are clear and on the table. The hand is empty, so the first action can be to pick up a block from the table.\n\n1. My goal is to stack the black block on top of the orange block. Since both black and orange are clear and on the table, I can:\n   - Pick up the black block.\n   - Stack the black block on top of the orange block.\n   \n2. Next, the blue block needs to be on top of the black block. Currently, the blue block is clear and on the table, and the hand is empty. I can:\n   - Pick up the blue block.\n   - Stack the blue block on top of the black block.\n\n3. Afterward, I need to stack the green block on top of the blue block. The green block is clear and on the table. I can:\n   - Pick up the green block.\n   - Stack the green block on top of the blue block.\n\n4. Finally, I need to ensure the red block is on top of the green block, which is now on top of the blue. The red block is clear and on the table, and the hand is empty, allowing me to:\n   - Pick up the red block.\n   - Stack the red block on top of the green block.\n\nAt this point, all the goals are satisfied with these steps. \n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up black) (stack black orange) (pick-up blue) (stack blue black) (pick-up green) (stack green blue) (pick-up red) (stack red green)",

        "answer": "Let's go through the problem step by step:\n\nWe have the following initial conditions:\n- All the blocks (red, blue, orange, yellow, black, cyan, green, violet, silver) are clear and on the table.\n- The hand is empty.\n\nThe goal is to achieve:\n1. Red block on top of Green block.\n2. Blue block on top of Silver block.\n3. Orange block on top of Black block.\n4. Yellow block on top of Blue block.\n5. Black block on top of Cyan block.\n6. Cyan block on top of Yellow block.\n7. Green block on top of Orange block.\n8. Silver block on top of Violet block.\n\nFollowing the restrictions and rules while achieving these goals step-by-step:\n\n1. Make stack Violet < Silver:\n   - Pick up the silver block.\n   - Stack the silver block on top of the violet block.\n\n2. Make stack Silver < Blue:\n   - Pick up the blue block.\n   - Stack the blue block on top of the silver block.\n\n3. Make stack Blue < Yellow:\n   - Pick up the yellow block.\n   - Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n\n4. Make stack Yellow < Cyan:\n   - Pick up the cyan block.\n   - Stack the cyan block on top of the yellow block.\n\n5. Make stack Cyan < Black:\n   - Pick up the black block.\n   - Stack the black block on top of the cyan block.\n\n6. Make stack Black < Orange:\n   - Pick up the orange block.\n   - Stack the orange block on top of the black block.\n\n7. Make stack Orange < Green:\n   - Pick up the green block.\n   - Stack the green block on top of the orange block.\n\n8. Make stack Green < Red:\n   - Pick up the red block.\n   - Stack the red block on top of the green block.\n\nBy following this order, each block is moved while respecting the rules that a block should only be stacked on another if the destination block is clear. Each action maintains the constraints of having a single block in hand and ensuring that blocks are clear before stacking.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(pick-up silver)\n(stack silver violet)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue silver)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan yellow)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black cyan)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange black)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green orange)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red green)",

The cyan block is clear, and so is the orange block, thus:\n   - (pick-up cyan)\n   - (stack cyan orange)\n\n2. Next, we want the yellow block to be on top of the cyan block. The yellow block is clear, and the cyan block is the top of its stack, making it clear:\n   - (pick-up yellow)\n   - (stack yellow cyan)\n\n3. We then want the blue block to be on top of the yellow block. The blue block is clear, and the yellow block is now the top of its stack and clear:\n   - (pick-up blue)\n   - (stack blue yellow)\n\n4. The goal specifies that the violet block should be on top of the blue block. The violet block is clear, and the blue block is currently the top of a stack and clear:\n   - (pick-up violet)\n   - (stack violet blue)\n\n5.

The conditions allow this action because the white block is clear and on the table.\n2. Next, we stack the white block on top of the magenta block. This makes the white block no longer clear, but positions the white block correctly according to the goal state.\n3. Now, we need the blue block to be on top of the white block.

        "answer": "The initial conditions are that all blocks are clear, the hand is empty, and all blocks are on the table. \n\n1. To achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the black block, the white block on top of the gold block, the black block on top of the white block, and the violet block on top of the red block, we need to rearrange the blocks according to the goal.\n\n2. We evaluate the required sequences and determine the steps for rearrangement.\n\n3. Since the white block needs to be on the gold block, and the gold block is currently clear, we start by picking up the white block with an empty hand.\n\n4. We stack the white block on top of the gold block. Now the white block is no longer clear, and the hand is empty again.\n\n5. The next move is to place the black block on top of the white block. We pick up the black block.\n\n6. We stack the black block on top of the white block. Now the black block is not clear, and the hand is empty.\n\n7. Next, we need to place the red block on top of the black block. To do this, we pick up the red block.\n\n8. We stack the red block on top of the black block. Now, the red block is not clear, and the hand is empty.\n\n9. Finally, we need to place the violet block on top of the red block. We pick up the violet block.\n\n10. We stack the violet block on top of the red block. This completes the stack, meeting all the conditions outlined in the goal.\n\nFollowing these steps satisfies all the initial goal conditions.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(pick-up white)\n(stack white gold)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black white)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red black)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet red)",

        "answer": "To solve the block stacking problem, we need to fulfill the specific condition that each block is stacked in the desired order as mentioned in the goal. Here's a step-by-step inference of the actions needed:\n\n1. The first goal is to have the magenta block on top of the blue block. Since both are initially clear and on the table, we can:\n   - Pick up the magenta block.\n   - Stack the magenta block on top of the blue block.\n\n2. To have the cyan block on top of the magenta block, we need to:\n   - Pick up the cyan block.\n   - Stack the cyan block on top of the magenta block.\n\n3. Next, to have the gold block on top of the cyan block:\n   - Pick up the gold block.\n   - Stack the gold block on top of the cyan block.\n\n4. For the violet block to be on top of the gold block:\n   - Pick up the violet block.\n   - Stack the violet block on top of the gold block.\n\n5. To achieve the configuration where the white block is on top of the violet block:\n   - Pick up the white block.\n   - Stack the white block on top of the violet block.\n\n6. The goal of having the red block on top of the white block is achieved by:\n   - Picking up the red block.\n   - Stacking the red block on top of the white block.\n\n7. To position the black block on top of the red block:\n   - Pick up the black block.\n   - Stack the black block on top of the red block.\n\n8. To place the orange block on top of the black block:\n   - Pick up the orange block.\n   - Stack the orange block on top of the black block.\n\n9.
