The red block should be on top of the green block.\n2. The blue block should be on top of the yellow block.\n3. The yellow block should be on top of the silver block.\n4. The white block should be on top of the blue block.\n5. The cyan block should be on top of the white block.\n6. The green block should be on top of the cyan block.\n7. The violet block should be on top of the red block.\n\nTo achieve this configuration, the following steps can be taken:\n\nStep 1: Pick up the yellow block\n- The yellow block is clear and the hand is empty.\n\nStep 2: Stack the yellow block on top of the silver block\n- The silver block is clear, thus allowing the yellow block to be stacked upon it.\n\nStep 3: Pick up the blue block\n- The blue block is clear and the hand is empty.\n\nStep 4: Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block\n- The yellow block is currently on top of the silver block and clear.\n\nStep 5: Pick up the white block\n- The white block is clear and the hand is empty.\n\nStep 6: Stack the white block on top of the blue block\n- The blue block is currently on top of the yellow block and clear.\n\nStep 7: Pick up the cyan block\n- The cyan block is clear and the hand is empty.\n\nStep 8: Stack the cyan block on top of the white block\n- The white block is currently on top of the blue block and clear.\n\nStep 9: Pick up the green block\n- The green block is clear and the hand is empty.\n\nStep 10: Stack the green block on top of the cyan block\n- The cyan block is currently on top of the white block and clear.\n\nStep 11: Pick up the red block\n- The red block is clear and the hand is empty.\n\nStep 12: Stack the red block on top of the green block\n- The green block is currently on top of the cyan block and clear.\n\nStep 13: Pick up the violet block\n- The violet block is clear and the hand is empty.\n\nStep 14: Stack the violet block on top of the red block\n- The red block is currently on top of the green block and clear.\n\nBy following these steps, the desired arrangement is achieved.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow silver)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white blue)\n(pick-up cyan)\n(stack cyan white)\n(pick-up green)\n(stack green cyan)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red green)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet red)",
