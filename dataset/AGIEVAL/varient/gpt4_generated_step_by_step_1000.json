However, choosing between these two girls doesn't force the selection of any particular boy due to the constraints outlined.\n\nThus, examining the options given:\n\n(A) Fang Rufen - Could be selected to fulfill the need for the second girl, but not a must.\n(B) He Zhilian - Could be selected to fulfill the need for the second girl, but not a must.\n(C) Peng Youwen - There's no must as long as Song Kaiwen isn't chosen.\n(D) Qiu Zhijie - The only person whose selection is consistent with ensuring requirements aren't broken when Guo Yanran is selected, along with flexibility in boys' selection.\n\nUltimately, Qiu Zhijie must be selected with Guo Yanran to prevent any conflict due to these constraints, ensuring that all requirements are smoothly kept.\n\nFinal Answer: D",

A redshift indicates the object is moving away (common in most galaxies, suggesting an expanding universe), while a blue shift suggests the object is moving closer. \n\nStep 2: Examine how each option could refute the view that the universe is expanding.\n\nOption (A): Finding blue-shifted objects in the distant universe doesn't negate the predominant redshifted observation; it may just represent local movements within an expanding universe.\n\nOption (B): The location of Earth in the universe doesn't impact the observation of redshift or the conclusion of expansion; it's about observation relative to all points.\n\nOption (C): If we can only observe less than one percent of the actual universe, this suggests our current data might not be representative of the whole universe and therefore, assumptions about universal expansion could be based on limited or skewed data.\n\nOption (D): If redshift is a dominant phenomenon from the perspective of other celestial bodies as well, it supports the view that the universe is expanding from all points, not refutes it.\n\nStep 3: Determine which option best refutes the scientists' views.\nThe best refutation comes from Option (C): the realization that observations might not represent the entire universe, thus challenging the certainty of the expansion theory based merely on our observational data. \n\nFinal Answer: C",

The statement posits that chili relieves indigestion, based on the experiment where 60% of the participants experienced relief after taking chili tablets.\n\n2. To refute this conclusion, we need evidence that contradicts or undermines the claim that chili effectively relieves indigestion.\n\n3. Option (A): If capsaicin in chili hinders the secretion of a neurotransmitter, this could explain a physiological mechanism for discomfort rather than relief, potentially contradicting the conclusion.\n\n4. Option (B): A worsening of symptoms in 5% of participants does not strongly refute the conclusion because the overall outcome still shows a majority benefit.\n\n5. Option (C): If another group experienced symptom relief by taking the pill after meals (55% alleviation), this may suggest that the timing (before or after meals) isn't crucial, but it doesn't directly refute the effectiveness of chili itself.\n\n6. Option (D): If dyspepsia symptoms generally ease within a month with a healthy diet, this suggests an alternative explanation for the relief observed in participants, unrelated to chili, potentially refuting the conclusion.\n\nFinal Answer: D",

Option (A) suggests that capsaicin, an active component in chili, hinders the secretion of a neurotransmitter. This statement does not directly address the effectiveness or the results of the experiment related to indigestion relief, nor does it offer an alternative explanation for how symptoms were relieved.\n\n2. Option (B) mentions that 5% of the experimenters experienced worsened symptoms. While this indicates that not everyone benefited from the treatment, it doesn't refute the overall finding that a majority (60%) experienced relief. A negative side effect for a minority doesn't constitute refutation.\n\n3. Option (C) describes another group where taking the pill after meals led to 55% of subjects experiencing symptom alleviation. This suggests that the timing of taking the pill might not be crucial and that the ingredients in the pill could still be effective after meals. While it shows similar effectiveness, it doesn't directly challenge the conclusion from the original experiment regarding pre-meal consumption.\n\n4. Option (D) states that focusing on a healthy diet can generally relieve discomfort symptoms within a month for patients with dyspepsia. This offers an alternative explanation for the symptom relief observed in the experiment \u2013 that improvements could be due to dietary changes rather than the chili-containing pills.

To question this conclusion, we need to identify an option that suggests the cost increase does not directly correlate with improved medical conditions.\n3. Option (A) suggests that most health care costs are spent on high-tech care for high-risk patients. This could imply that such expenditures might not lead to broad improvements in health conditions for the general population, challenging the conclusion.\n4. Option (B) argues that health conditions can improve without necessarily increasing costs, directly questioning the necessity of cost increases for improvements in medical conditions.\n5. Option (C) details state spending on infrastructure, which might not directly correlate to individual medical condition improvements, but it doesn't severely question the conclusion.\n6. Option (D) states that care costs for elderly chronic diseases are large, which might suggest a reason for increasing costs, but it doesn't necessarily challenge the improvement conclusion.\n\nConsidering these points, option (B) raises the most serious question to the conclusion, as it directly presents that costs may not need to increase for improvements, thus challenging the necessity implied in the conclusion.\n\nFinal Answer: B",
        "answer": "Step by Step INFERENCE HERE\n\nThe conclusion provided suggests that health care costs have increased, but as a result, medical conditions for individuals have greatly improved. To question this conclusion, one should consider whether the increase in cost directly correlates with improved medical conditions for everyone, as the statement implies.\n\n(A) This option highlights that a large portion of health care spending goes specifically towards high-tech intensive care for high-risk patients. This raises a significant question because it implies not all increased spending benefits general medical conditions or would lead to widespread improvement in health for all people, but rather, it concentrates on a specific group. Thus, it questions the generalization that the overall medical conditions for everyone have improved due to increased spending.\n\n(B) This option suggests that medical conditions might improve even without an increase in costs. While it raises a valid point, it doesn't directly address the aspect of how the increased costs are applied or question the specific conclusion regarding how these funds relate to the improvements.\n\n(C) This option speaks about the allocation of funds towards infrastructure. Although infrastructure is vital, it doesn't directly challenge whether these expenditures directly enhance personal medical conditions.\n\n(D) The focus here is on the costs associated with elderly chronic diseases. This is insightful regarding cost distribution, but it does not question the conclusion that overall medical improvements for \"each of us\" have resulted from increased health care spending. \n\nOption (A) introduces a specific concern involving the allocation of increased health care funds, which could bring into question whether these expenditures truly benefit the general population\u2019s health, making it the most serious question to the conclusion provided.\n\nFinal Answer: A",

It does not contribute to establishing the correctness as it focuses on those who do not have a high level, and no direct link to the overseas doctorates.\n\n   - (C) Some college teachers have a very high level.\n     This does not directly link the overseas doctorate with the high level, and simply knowing some have a very high level does not prove the given statement as correct.\n\n   - (D) All high-level teachers have overseas doctorate degrees.\n     This option strongly connects high-level teachers directly with having overseas doctorates. If all high-level teachers indeed have overseas doctorates, then it aligns well with the given statement and implies the correctness. However, it might be more than necessary to just establish a partial condition similar to the given statement.\n\n4. Given the choices, option (A) contributes to reinforcing some link between having a high level and some having overseas doctorates through a common theme of high level within teachers, possibly including those with overseas doctorates.\n\nFinal Answer: A",

The argument is that some advertisers chose not to renew their contracts because they consider ethical responsibilities in addition to economic benefits. The argument is weakened if these advertisers had other motivations for their actions apart from ethical concerns.\n\n2. Option (A) states that the violent and pornographic content in \"Purgatory\" magazine is more moderate compared to similar magazines. This suggests that the content is not as extreme as elsewhere, which might influence advertisers' decisions. It could imply that the advertisers were not overly concerned with ethical issues as the magazine's content was not significantly worse than others. However, it doesn't directly address the advertisers' motivations for switching publications.\n\n3. Option (B) indicates that magazines with violent and pornographic content sell well but lack credibility. This means advertisers might pull out due to concerns over credibility impacting the brand, rather than ethical concerns, directly weakening the argument.\n\n4. Option (C) states that the advertisers represented household goods. This could imply that advertising household goods in a magazine with violent or pornographic content would not align with their brand image or target audience, offering an economic reason for not renewing their contract. This is an alternative motivation that weakens the argument about ethical responsibility.\n\n5. Option (D) mentions that advertising costs increased significantly after the name change.

The argument is that some advertisers chose not to renew their contracts because they consider ethical responsibilities in addition to economic benefits. The argument is weakened if these advertisers had other motivations for their actions apart from ethical concerns.\n\n2. Option (A) states that the violent and pornographic content in \"Purgatory\" magazine is more moderate compared to similar magazines. This suggests that the content is not as extreme as elsewhere, which might influence advertisers' decisions. It could imply that the advertisers were not overly concerned with ethical issues as the magazine's content was not significantly worse than others. However, it doesn't directly address the advertisers' motivations for switching publications.\n\n3. Option (B) indicates that magazines with violent and pornographic content sell well but lack credibility. This means advertisers might pull out due to concerns over credibility impacting the brand, rather than ethical concerns, directly weakening the argument.\n\n4. Option (C) states that the advertisers represented household goods. This could imply that advertising household goods in a magazine with violent or pornographic content would not align with their brand image or target audience, offering an economic reason for not renewing their contract. This is an alternative motivation that weakens the argument about ethical responsibility.\n\n5. Option (D) mentions that advertising costs increased significantly after the name change. Higher advertising costs could explain why advertisers chose not to renew their contracts, presenting an economic factor that weakens the original argument about ethical motivations.\n\nThe question asks which option does not weaken the argument about ethical considerations. Analyzing the options, (A) provides an observation about content but does not directly address the advertisers' motivations or economic factors, making it the option that least weakens the argument of ethical responsibility considerations.\n\nFinal Answer: A",

Consider the situation:\n   - Kobayashi was refused entry into the deep pool because he did not wear a swimming cap.\n   - He mentioned showing the deep water certificate and claimed that according to the regulations, he could enter the deep pool.\n\n3. Based on the situation and regulations:\n   - From the regulation, even with a deep water certificate, a swimming cap is required to enter the swimming pool. Therefore, his entry was refused due to not wearing a swimming cap.\n   - However, Kobayashi is focusing on the point that possessing a deep water certificate allows him to enter the deep pool.\n\n4. Match the options with the rules and Kobayashi\u2019s understanding:\n   - (A) States a condition for entering the pool but does not address the swimming cap rule.\n   - (B) Incorrect as it implies not needing a swimming cap if you have a certificate.\n   - (C) Aligns with Kobayashi's interpretation that a certificate allows entry to the deep pool.\n   - (D) Describes a general rule about the pool but does not focus on Kobayashi\u2019s situation.\n\n5.

Therefore, if Zhao is right, Qian is wrong completely, making Sun partially right, which indicates the champion is Tsinghua (Professor Sun is right on Tsinghua statement).\n\n6. Attempting any other arrangement (like making Qian completely correct or Sun) ends up contradicting with Zhao's statements and the one professor being completely wrong and another being partially correct. Therefore, Sun is the one who is partially correct due to Tsinghua part.\n   \nFinal Answer: A",

C praises the Kenyan's performance.\n\nLet's deduce based on these statements:\n\n- **Statement (1)**: A performed better than the German. This means A cannot be German.\n\n- **Statement (2)**: Kenyan performed worse than B. This indicates B cannot be Kenyan (since B's performance was better).\n\nFrom Statement (2), B's performance is better than the Kenyan's.

However, since T must be off (from Condition 2) and T and X cannot be off at the same time (from Condition 3), X must be on. This implies W cannot be on because X is on, and if W were on, X must be on too, which doesn't directly impact this, but let's keep tracing.\n- If Y were on, then by the requirement (W must be on when Y and Z are both on), there's a contradiction here due to potential implications overlapping; let's assume Y must be off to avoid conflicting requirement along with Condition 4. Thus, Y is off, fulfilling the conditions without requiring W to be on.\n- This analysis fits with exactly the combination where S and Z are on, T is off, X is on, and Y is off without encountering a contradiction.\n\nFrom the options:\n\n- (A) is T being on and Y being off, but we found T must be off.\n- (B) is W and T both on, but T must be off.\n- (C) both T and Y are off.

Consequently, John did not go to Zhangjiajie, creating a conflict because all students need to accompany Zhao Qiang to Zhangjiajie.\n\n6. The clarification of condition highlights Xian and Hangzhou as being possible that John and other students can go, conditional on others meandering on these grounds.\n\n7. Since it\u2019s known John must be at Xi\u2019an or Hangzhou but cannot go to Zhangjiajie, he qualifies for only Xi\u2019an or Hangzhou.\n\n8.

Bush\u2019s logic in the statement revolves around the idea that whether Iraq actually had weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) or was merely attempting to acquire them, the threat perception is the same. The intention to acquire WMDs signifies a level of threat equivalent to actually possessing them.\n\n2. Examine each option to identify which one contradicts or does not align with Bush's logic:\n\n   - Option (A) suggests if Bush did not think about accepting bribes, it would mean he actually accepted them. This doesn\u2019t align with Bush's logic because the statement is not about the intention being equivalent to the action, but rather assuming the action did occur without evidence of acceptance.\n\n   - Option (B) states Bin Laden wants to be a good person, meaning he is a good person. This contrasts Bush's logic where intent (or perception of intent) equates with threat or action, without the need for actual proof of action.\n\n   - Option (C) posits the United States thinks the \"9.11 incident\" did not happen, and thus it really did not happen. This directly contradicts reality-based logic, where perception does not affect the occurrence of an event.\n\n   - Option (D) proposes if the Iraq War is not waged, there will be fewer American casualties. This logically follows consequence analysis, not directly tied to intent or preventive action as a threat.\n\n3.

Option A discusses the historical perception of coin tosses as examples of randomness, which does not address the difficulty of predicting outcomes based on physical factors.\n\n3. Option B suggests that a coin of uneven quality would lead to predictable results. However, it doesn't address the prediction difficulty for a uniformly high-quality coin, which is the focus of the discussion.\n\n4.

The students are most likely to interpret the professor\u2019s statement to mean that people with type O blood cannot have children with type B blood, reflecting option (B).\n\nFinal Answer: B",

Therefore, the argument must assume that it is not possible to both treat someone fairly (without prejudice) and simultaneously prioritize their interests above others.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the options.\n(A) Talks about impartiality among non-friends, which is irrelevant to the conflict between friends and fairness.\n(B) Dismisses the relevance of justice in most relationships, but the argument is focused specifically on friendships.\n(C) States that keeping close friends is important, but this doesn't bridge the idea of fairness and prioritization.\n(D) Directly addresses the conflict by stating one cannot be fair and regard someone\u2019s interests as more important than others simultaneously.\n\nStep 5: Choose the option that best fits the assumption.\nThe statement concludes that fairness and regarding someone\u2019s interests as more important cannot coexist. Thus, option D directly fits this assumption by stating exactly what is necessary for the argument\u2019s conclusion to hold.\n\nFinal Answer: D",

H can fill an automatic spot due to unconstrained free choice but does imply nothing definitive even though it might happen due to flexibility between others filling with constraints.\n\n- **Option D: J or M, or both.**  \n  As J is considered, it aligns automatically requires G when J is selected, J or M cannot be definitely ensured since M depends indirectly via F\u2019s situation.\n\nEvaluating the constraints above leads back to examining if B crosses AT LEAST with alternatives in absence or presence constraints, especially with modular flexibility pick permutations like K, H or balancing E/F trade-off,\nWhere if J consideration overlaps also brings G notion positing F's M notion needs closures, even convexity within algorithmic solving it primes across G inherent dependency common in lesser contradictory constraints.\n\nThus, after evaluating all, the answer ensures the utmost derivative selection based off constraints:\n\nFinal Answer: B",

This discrepancy suggests that factors other than land prices might be contributing to high housing prices. However, since land prices did increase, it might still play a role, albeit not the sole one.\n\n2. **Option (B)**: Here, residential prices in Beijing rose by 7.2%, while land prices showed a minimal increase of only 0.37%. The small rise in land prices compared to the much larger increase in housing prices strongly suggests that other factors are driving the housing price increase, casting doubt on the assertion that rising land prices are the primary cause.\n\n3. **Option (C)**: This is an opinion from the chairman of Huayuan Real Estate suggesting a direct correlation between increased land development costs and housing prices.

This discrepancy suggests that factors other than land prices might be contributing to high housing prices. However, since land prices did increase, it might still play a role, albeit not the sole one.\n\n2. **Option (B)**: Here, residential prices in Beijing rose by 7.2%, while land prices showed a minimal increase of only 0.37%. The small rise in land prices compared to the much larger increase in housing prices strongly suggests that other factors are driving the housing price increase, casting doubt on the assertion that rising land prices are the primary cause.\n\n3. **Option (C)**: This is an opinion from the chairman of Huayuan Real Estate suggesting a direct correlation between increased land development costs and housing prices. This supports, rather than doubts, the assertion.\n\n4. **Option (D)**: The statement from the Yongtai Development Company's chairman attributes rising housing prices to a supply-demand mismatch.

Let's analyze the options:\n\n   - (A) This option relates to the enforceability of laws, not directly concerned with adopting flexible standards or linking to the core issue discussed, which is how governance also relies on guidelines beyond laws.\n   \n   - (B) This option suggests that inflexible standards cannot leverage the benefits of optimal action criteria, linking directly to the statement's emphasis on flexible standards as advantageous.\n   \n   - (C) This option addresses the potential problems of implementing laws if they are too flexible, which is related to law execution rather than supplementing laws with guidelines.\n   \n   - (D) This option posits that while laws are indispensable, actions based on them are also necessary; however, the argument pivots mainly around flexibility, not indispensability alone.\n\n4. Based on the statement provided, the superior argument depends on the unaddressed merit of flexible guidelines, not less flexibility or law implementation issues.\n\n5. Option (B) directly aligns with the statement\u2019s emphasis on the advantages of adopting flexible action criteria: By stating that less flexible standards cannot utilize optimal criteria, it supports the hypothesis that additional flexible guidelines are superior.\n\nFinal Answer: B",

        "answer": "Step by Step INFERENCE HERE\n\nThe argument is that the length of a person's life influences whether they engage in good or bad behavior, in part due to the fear of being caught. To weaken this argument, we would need to show that the length of life is not a deciding factor in whether someone chooses to engage in good or bad behavior or to introduce another factor that is more significant.\n\n(A) Only by suffering from the fear of being caught will you not steal things from others. - This implies that fear of being caught is the main deterrent, which supports the argument rather than weakens it.\n\n(B) For people who only live one day, the best course of action may be a meal of beef. - This suggests an alternative action other than stealing for those who have only one day to live, which doesn't address the core of the argument about fear more than lifespan's role.\n\n(C) The length of life is not a sufficient condition for a person to choose to do good or bad behavior. - This directly weakens the argument by stating that lifespan alone does not determine behavior, thus challenging the idea that life expectancy impacts ethical decisions.\n\n(D) For some people who steal other people's things, conscience condemnation will cause greater pain than fear of seizing. - This introduces conscience as a more significant deterrent than fear of being caught, which could also weaken the argument because it shows another factor influencing behavior.\n\n(C) and (D) both offer ways to weaken the argument by showing other determinants or questioning the sufficiency of lifespan as a factor.

The argument presented in the statement suggests that the length of a person's life influences whether they engage in good or bad behavior, specifically relating to stealing. If a person lives only one day, stealing might seem optimal as there is less risk of being caught, whereas someone living longer, say 20 years, would fear repercussions over time.\n\n2. Option (A) states that only the fear of being caught prevents stealing. If this statement were true, it aligns with the argument's premise that fear due to a longer life span deters stealing. Therefore, it does not weaken the argument.\n\n3. Option (B) suggests people who live just one day might choose to have a meal instead of stealing. This introduces an alternative behavior independent of stealing but does not specifically challenge the connection between life span and behavior. It offers a potential counter-scenario but does not weaken the central link posited by the argument.\n\n4. Option (C) claims that life length alone is not enough for deciding good or bad behavior. This directly challenges the assumption inherent in the argument that life length determines behavior, potentially weakening it.\n\n5. Option (D) introduces the idea of conscience guilt as a greater deterrent than fear of getting caught for some individuals.

This option suggests an inconsistency in data, but it doesn't address the average age misinterpretation, which seems to be the primary focus in the provided reasoning.\n\n(B) This option points out that the sample is too small and suggests including data from additional institutions. While a small sample size can affect the reliability of the results, the issue highlighted in the original reasoning is more about misinterpretation of the cause or nature of the data collected, not directly about the sample size.\n\n(C) This option draws a parallel between the conclusion drawn from the original statement and a hypothetical scenario where the average age of death of college students implies much lower life expectancy for educated individuals. This highlights the fallacy in assuming that the average age of death of in-service intellectuals at certain institutions represents the life expectancy for all similar intellectuals, without accounting for the fact that in-service individuals are part of a limited age group and may naturally experience higher mortality due to their specific career stresses or conditions.\n\n(D) This option suggests that the reasoning fails to distinguish between different types of intellectuals. While this could be a valid critique, it does not directly address the contrast between the specific group's average age of death and broader life expectancy statistics. \n\nThe most accurate fallacy here is illustrated by option (C), which demonstrates the flaw in reasoning by using a classical misinterpretation example and points out the need to consider specific demographic and occupational factors when comparing such data to broader life expectancy statistics.\n\nFinal Answer: C",

While a small sample size can affect the reliability of the results, the issue highlighted in the original reasoning is more about misinterpretation of the cause or nature of the data collected, not directly about the sample size.\n\n(C) This option draws a parallel between the conclusion drawn from the original statement and a hypothetical scenario where the average age of death of college students implies much lower life expectancy for educated individuals. This highlights the fallacy in assuming that the average age of death of in-service intellectuals at certain institutions represents the life expectancy for all similar intellectuals, without accounting for the fact that in-service individuals are part of a limited age group and may naturally experience higher mortality due to their specific career stresses or conditions.\n\n(D) This option suggests that the reasoning fails to distinguish between different types of intellectuals. While this could be a valid critique, it does not directly address the contrast between the specific group's average age of death and broader life expectancy statistics. \n\nThe most accurate fallacy here is illustrated by option (C), which demonstrates the flaw in reasoning by using a classical misinterpretation example and points out the need to consider specific demographic and occupational factors when comparing such data to broader life expectancy statistics.\n\nFinal Answer: C",

Thus, there is a contradiction in assuming A is telling the truth.\n\nLet's assume B is telling the truth:\n\n- If B is telling the truth, then C must be lying.\n- If C is lying, then C's statement that \"A and B lied\" is false. Therefore, at least one of A or B is telling the truth. Since we're assuming B is truthful, we have consistency here.\n\nStill, if C is lying, B's claim that C lied holds true, but it contradicts C's claim. Thus this assumption leads to an irresolvable situation, suggesting it doesn't hold universally.\n\nLet's assume C is telling the truth:\n\n- If C is telling the truth, then both A and B are lying (which is what C claimed).\n- If A is lying, then B is not lying (this aligns with B's statement being the fallacy if C is saying B is truthful).\n- If B says C lied and this is a lie itself, C telling the truth makes sense as C claims A and B lied.\n\nTherefore, C being truthful resolves all contradictions.\n\nGiven these deductions when C is truthful:\n\n- A lies about B lying.\n- B lies about C lying.\n- C is truthful about both A and B lying.\n\nFinal Answer: C",

This arrangement satisfies all given conditions and also places I and E adjacent as required by condition 2.\n  \n- With the new condition G and E are adjacent, let's position G directly north of E: G, E.\n\n- Placing G directly north of E, and considering G is somewhere north of F and E must be adjacent to I, the correct possible order considering all constraints (G, E are adjacent; G is north of F; I and E are adjacent) could be:\n\n  G, E, I, F, H\n\n  In this arrangement:\n  - G is north of E, satisfying the adjacency condition.\n  - G is north of F, as per condition 3.\n  - E and I are adjacent, meeting condition 2.\n  - F is north of H, as per condition 1.\n  \nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n(A) E is somewhere north of G - This is false in our arrangement, since E is south of G.\n(B) F is somewhere north of I - This is false, as I is north of F in the order G, E, I, F, H.\n(C) G is somewhere north of E - This is true in our derived order.\n(D) I is somewhere north of F - This is also true in the order G, E, I, F, H.\n\nSince both options C and D are satisfied in this configuration, we need to identify which options must be true. The statement that must be true is option C because it universally confirms G's position relative to E based on the new condition G and E are adjacent.

G is somewhere in the north of F.\n\nAccording to these statements and the additional condition (G and E are adjacent), we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since G is north of F, the possible initial arrangement (with no additional constraints) from north to south could be G, F, H, I, E. This arrangement satisfies all given conditions and also places I and E adjacent as required by condition 2.\n  \n- With the new condition G and E are adjacent, let's position G directly north of E: G, E.\n\n- Placing G directly north of E, and considering G is somewhere north of F and E must be adjacent to I, the correct possible order considering all constraints (G, E are adjacent; G is north of F; I and E are adjacent) could be:\n\n  G, E, I, F, H\n\n  In this arrangement:\n  - G is north of E, satisfying the adjacency condition.\n  - G is north of F, as per condition 3.\n  - E and I are adjacent, meeting condition 2.\n  - F is north of H, as per condition 1.\n  \nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n(A) E is somewhere north of G - This is false in our arrangement, since E is south of G.\n(B) F is somewhere north of I - This is false, as I is north of F in the order G, E, I, F, H.\n(C) G is somewhere north of E - This is true in our derived order.\n(D) I is somewhere north of F - This is also true in the order G, E, I, F, H.\n\nSince both options C and D are satisfied in this configuration, we need to identify which options must be true. The statement that must be true is option C because it universally confirms G's position relative to E based on the new condition G and E are adjacent. However, option D directly correlates with the logic chain above and remains valid as a further inference from all original conditions.\n\nThus, we must consider the specifics of must be true from provided relational positioning, which gives the strong condition of positioning:\n\nFinal Answer: D",

Let's break down the given argument:\n   - \"I think, so I exist.\" implies that thinking is proof of existence (Descartes' \"Cogito, ergo sum\").\n   - \"If I don't exist, then I don't think.\" If existence is a prerequisite for thinking, non-existence implies no thinking.\n   - \"If I think, then life means nothing.\" Thinking correlates to life being meaningless according to this philosopher.\n\n2.

Analyzing implications:\n   - If \"life means nothing\" when I think, and life is not equal to emptiness, thinking does not equate my life to emptiness but to 'nothingness' in another sense.\n   - Despite \"nothing\" potentially aligning closer to 'meaningless', life possessing meaning beyond emptiness indicates something persists on thinking: existence itself.\n\n4. Derived conclusions:\n   - Given \u201cI think, therefore I exist\u201d and thinking resulting in life having no particular inherent meaning, adding that life is not emptiness strengthens the position of existence when thinking occurs. Thinking entails existential proof, irrespective of inherent life meaninglessness.\n   - The options listed indicate an alignment towards confirming existence or thought, rather than negation (given \u201clife does not mean emptiness\u201d).\n\n5.

The statement suggests abolishing the pre-sale system will not push up housing prices. Instead, the claim is made that if the pre-sale system did result in higher housing prices once abolished, developers would naturally circumvent the system without needing government intervention.\n\n2. We are looking for a technique where the argument is proving a viewpoint false by hypothesizing the consequences of accepting it as true, and if those consequences are incredible or unlikely, then the viewpoint is deemed incorrect.\n\n3. Option (A) talks about the lack of factual support, which is not directly the technique used in this argument. The argument instead focuses on hypothetical outcomes rather than lack of support.\n\n4. Option (B) refers to violating a general principle, which does not directly apply here as there is no mention of a general principle in the argument.\n\n5. Option (C) involves contradicting a statement already known to be true. The argument does not indicate any contradictions with a pre-established true statement but rather focuses on the implications of accepting the opposing viewpoint.\n\n6. Option (D) suggests that by imagining the acceptance of the opposing viewpoint (abolishing increases prices), it leads to an 'incredible' or unlikely result (developers disregarding a profitable system), thus indicating the false nature of the viewpoint.\n\nThe argument is more aligned with option (D), as it illustrates that accepting the idea of abolishing the pre-sale system leading to higher prices leads to an unlikely scenario where developers would bypass a profitable system themselves if it were truly beneficial.\n\nFinal Answer: D",

        "answer": "Step by Step INFERENCE HERE:\n\n1. Expert's point of view suggests that the ecological environment of Dongting Lake has been damaged, leading to the rat disaster.\n\n2. (A) After the reduction of natural predators like snakes and owls, the ecological balance that controls the rodent population is upset. This supports the idea that ecological damage can lead to an overpopulation of rats since predators that keep their numbers in check are reduced.\n\n3. (B) Human activities like \"enclosing lakes to make fields\" and \"building embankments and destroying snails\" altering the waters of Dongting Lake are directly related to human-induced changes to the ecology, potentially leading to environmental damage. This supports the expert\u2019s view on ecological damage.\n\n4. (C) The scenario where the water level did not rise much during the flood season because of a drought implies a natural environmental event. While drought can affect ecosystems, the statement does not directly suggest human-induced ecological damage. However, it implies that natural factors (rather than human actions) contributed to the rodent issue. This option deviates from the idea of ecological damage, but given the context, it might still align with unintended ecological shifts due to climate anomalies, potentially indirectly supporting the expert's point.\n\n5. (D) Converting wetlands into woodlands suitable for mice survival due to human modification (drainage and planting poplar trees) directly supports the idea of ecological changes leading to the current scenario. This also directly supports the ecological disruption view.\n\nFinal Answer: C",

The elimination of these predators would disrupt the ecological balance and allow the mice population to increase, supporting the expert's point of view.\n\n3.

This does criticize the potential effectiveness of mediation but is more a critique of the parties themselves rather than the timing of mediation.\n   - (C) The mediation process itself will take as much time as the current prosecution process. This criticizes mediation in terms of time but not specifically the timing within the prosecution process.\n   - (D) As the court debate progresses, the attitude between the opponents will tend to be tougher, making mutual compromises less likely. This directly criticizes the timing of introducing mediation because it suggests that waiting until later in the process makes mediation less effective, thus strengthening the criticism of the HR department's proposal.\n\nFinal Answer: D",

        "answer": "To solve this, we need to determine the committee memberships that satisfy the given conditions. \n\n1. **Constraints and Setup**:\n   - There are 6 members: F, G, H, I, M, and P.\n   - Each must be in at least one of the three sub-committees.\n   - Each sub-committee has 3 different members.\n   - One member serves in all three sub-committees.\n   - F and G can't be together in any sub-committee.\n   - H and I can't be together in any sub-committee.\n\n2. **Explicit Constraints**:\n   - Let's denote the sub-committees as \\( S1, S2, S3 \\).\n   - Suppose M is the member who serves in all three sub-committees (this choice is arbitrary but helps satisfy the requirement that each sub-committee has 3 members).\n\n3. **Membership Assignments**:\n   - Assume M is in \\( S1, S2, S3 \\).\n   - F and G must be assigned to different sub-committees. If F is in \\( S1 \\), then G cannot be in \\( S1 \\). Place G in \\( S2 \\) or \\( S3 \\).\n   - Similarly, H and I have to be assigned to different sub-committees. If H is in \\( S2 \\), I cannot be in \\( S2 \\). Place I in \\( S1 \\) or \\( S3 \\).\n   - Knowing M is in all, cover the gaps left by placing P appropriately.\n\n4. **Validation**:\n   - Assume initial assignments such as:\n     - \\( S1 = \\{ F, I, M \\} \\)\n     - \\( S2 = \\{ G, H, M \\} \\)\n     - \\( S3 = \\{ P, F, M \\} \\)\n   - Check the conditions:\n     - F not with G? Yes.\n     - H not with I? Yes.\n     - Each subcommittee has 3 members? Yes.\n     - Each member in at least 1 sub-committee? Yes.\n\n5. **Analysis of the Options**:\n   - **(A) M and P are members of a subcommittee.** We can arrange \\( S3 = \\{ M, P, F \\} \\) to satisfy this option.\n   - **(B) F and H are members of a subcommittee.** There is no requirement aligning F with H directly.\n   - **(C) G and I are members of a subcommittee.** This isn't a guarantee based on our setup.\n   - **(D) 1 member of any sub-committee.** This is unclear and nonspecific.\n\nThus, for surety without disregarding any possibility, **Option A can happen while others aren't guaranteed in every construction**.\n\nFinal Answer: A",

Option A argues that all American athletes, including swimmer Phelps, want to perform on the Olympic stage. Since the given statement suggests there is at least one athlete who does not want to, this option does not necessarily have to be false as it does not claim all athletes universally.\n\n4. Option B states that some Jamaican athletes, like sprinter Bolt, want to appear on the stage of the Olympics.

Option C states that China's 110-meter hurdler Liu Xiang does not want to appear on the stage of the Olympics and enjoy performing on it.

Analyze Option (A): This statement discusses dogs and cats being sometimes anxious before earthquakes, and claims there is no reason to conclude they can sense earthquakes because they are frequently anxious even when there is no earthquake. This aligns with Dai Wei's case as in both scenarios occasional instances (stomach pain and anxiety) lead to a conclusion of no special condition (allergy and earthquake sensing) when those instances are not consistently correlated with the anticipated outcomes (frequent issues or earthquakes).\n\n3. Analyze Option (B): This talks about people losing weight with short-term diets but questions their effectiveness. This does not align with the original reasoning as it's more about questioning the effectiveness despite apparent success, rather than using the scarcity of evidence to dismiss a potential condition.\n\n4.

The given argument states that for intellectual progress, one must not only have freedom of thought but also maintain sufficient connections related to certain ideas, which implies some sort of rules or structure in thinking.\n\n2. The conclusion made is that the argument in favor of freedom of thought being essential for intellectual progress is untenable because thinkers need to think about the law or rules as well.\n\n3. For this conclusion to hold, we need a statement that shows that freedom of thought without some rules or structure (law of thought) will not suffice for intellectual progress.\n\n4. Option (A) states that in societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers always lack the rules of thinking. This directly supports the idea that merely having freedom of thought is not enough because if they lack rules, the argument for intellectual progress being solely dependent on freedom of thought becomes untenable.\n\n5. Option (B) and (C) both relate to the notion that intellectual progress can be hindered or aided by certain types of thought (orthodox or creative), but these do not directly address the necessity of rules alongside freedom.\n\n6.

        "answer": "Step by Step INFERENCE HERE\n\n1. The argument suggests that countries experience a recession after the Olympics due to the disappearance of infrastructure investments and increased tourism that had temporarily boosted the economy.\n\n2. We need to find a statement that refutes or questions the conclusion that China will necessarily face a recession post-2008 Olympics.\n\n3. Let's evaluate each option:\n\n   (A) If China's economic growth attributed to the Olympics is minimal (0.2% - 0.4%), it suggests the Olympics had a limited impact, hence other factors could maintain economic stability, but it doesn't directly question the pattern of post-Olympic recession.\n\n   (B) This option shows instances where the US did not experience a recession after hosting, indicating that it's possible to avoid a recession post-Olympics. This questions the universality of the pattern but does not necessarily apply to China.\n\n   (C) If China's urbanization is accelerating and promoting ongoing economic development, it implies that even after the Olympics, China would continue investing in urban construction, counteracting potential recessionary pressures and questioning the conclusion about recession.\n\n   (D) This speaks to stadium utilization post-Olympics and community benefit but does not directly impact the overall economic concerns about a recession.\n\n4.

The argument concludes that China will also experience an economic recession after the 2008 Olympic Games, due to the historical pattern observed in other countries.\n\n3. To question the conclusion, we need to provide a piece of information that could suggest the pattern observed in other countries (economic recession after the Olympics) might not apply to China.\n\n4. Option (A) states that the Olympic Games' role in promoting China's economic growth is limited (0.2%-0.4%), suggesting that the downturn might not be significant, but this does not directly challenge the causality that economic decline is inevitable after the Olympics.\n\n5. Option (B) states that neither the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics nor the 1996 Atlanta Olympics caused an economic decline for the US. This option provides counterexamples where the expected economic decline did not occur, thus challenging the universality of the argument\u2019s conclusion.\n\n6. Option (C) indicates China's urbanization will continue to drive economic development, which suggests ongoing economic activities can counter recession trends, hence challenging the conclusion.\n\n7. Option (D) suggests that infrastructure built for the Olympics will continue to be used by citizens, contributing to longer-term economic activity, but it more specifically addresses infrastructure use, rather than directly countering the inevitability of a recession.\n\n8.

This is a reasoning error but involves making an unsupported conclusion about susceptibility rather than identifying a direct cause from observed effects.\n\n   (C) Assumes that zoo animals are definitely not easily infected because they aren't malnourished. This involves flawed reasoning about immunity based on one factor, but does not fit the direct cause-and-effect assumed in the original statement.\n\n   (D) Claims that a fossil must be an ape because it has a reversible thumb. This is a reasoning error of assuming identity based on one characteristic but involves classification rather than cause and effect.\n\n3. Option (A) contains the most similar reasoning error to the initial statement, as both involve a post hoc assumption about cause and effect without direct evidence.\n\nFinal Answer: A",

But if A or B is the thief, then we have a problem because D's statement \"B or C is a fish thief\" could still be true regardless, as it does not differentiate enough. C's truthfulness leads to ambiguity with D's statement, so it seems incorrect.\n\n- **If D is telling the truth:** \"B or C is a fish thief,\" then by elimination, C must be the thief because if B were the thief, multiple cats would be telling the truth. \n\nTherefore, the thief is C, which means:\n- A's statement \"B is a fish thief\" is false.\n- B's statement \"C is a fish thief\" is true.\n- C's statement \"A or B is a fish thief\" is false.\n- D's statement \"B or C is a fish thief\" is true.\n\nThus:\n- (A) A is not a fish thief.

Option (A) suggests that the lower price level in China could contribute to lower production costs despite rising labor costs. While this could reduce overall costs, it does not specifically address why manufacturing costs are almost similar between the US and China.\n\n4. Option (B) talks about transferring factories to other countries due to rising labor costs. This explains a strategic move by businesses rather than directly explaining why manufacturing costs are still competitive in China.\n\n5. Option (C) mentions the profit margin in China's manufacturing industry being low. Low profit margins imply that cost savings elsewhere are not being passed on to profit but rather keeping costs down. However, it doesn't address why Chinese manufacturing costs would be closer to the US despite rising labor costs.\n\n6. Option (D) suggests an increase in the cost of fixed assets and energy in China, which gives an indication of why costs are rising. If these costs are increasing alongside labor costs, manufacturing in China would naturally become more expensive and approach US costs. Thus, this is a contributing factor to the rising manufacturing index (96 compared to 100).\n\nBased on the inference, the best explanation for the smaller cost difference despite increasing labor costs is due to the effect of rising costs of fixed assets and energy.\n\nFinal Answer: D",

Option (D) relates to the workload (mileage) and not directly to salary structure, hence it isn't necessary for the conclusion that the salary structure itself is low.\n\n6. Thus, the argument that \"salaries of pilots of state-owned airlines are too low\" can be supported by the assumption in option (C), which states that if those pilots who still stay in state-run airlines also choose to go to private airlines, their annual salary will also exceed one million. This suggests that the state-owned airlines are the limiting factor on pilot salaries.\n\nFinal Answer: C",
