A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block and the blue block is on top of the yellow block.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]\nunstack the blue block from on top of the orange block\nstack the blue block on top of the yellow block\nunstack the orange block from on top of the red block\nput down the orange block\npick up the red block\nstack the red block on top of the orange block\n[PLAN END]\n \n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",

Here are the actions I can do\n\nPick up a block\nUnstack a block from on top of another block\nPut down a block\nStack a block on top of another block\n\nI have the following restrictions on my actions:\nI can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.\nI can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.\nI can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the red block is on top of the yellow block and the orange block is on top of the red block.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]\nunstack the red block from on top of the blue block\nput down the red block\nunstack the blue block from on top of the orange block\nput down the blue block\nunstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block\nstack the orange block on top of the blue block\npick up the red block\nstack the red block on top of the yellow block\nunstack the orange block from on top of the blue block\nstack the orange block on top of the red block\n[PLAN END]\n \n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the blue block is clear, the hand is currently holding red block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on the table.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",

A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the white block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the white block is on top of the orange block and the yellow block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the orange block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the white block.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]\nunstack the red block from on top of the white block\nput down the red block\nunstack the white block from on top of the orange block\nput down the white block\nunstack the orange block from on top of the blue block\nstack the orange block on top of the red block\nunstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block\nput down the blue block\npick up the yellow block\nstack the yellow block on top of the white block\nunstack the orange block from on top of the red block\nstack the orange block on top of the yellow block\n[PLAN END]\n \n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the white block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the white block is on top of the orange block and the yellow block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the white block, the red block is on the table, the blue block is on the table and the white block is on the table.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",

A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table, the orange block is on the table, the yellow block is on the table and the white block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the white block, the yellow block is on top of the red block and the white block is on top of the orange block.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]\npick up the white block\nstack the white block on top of the orange block\nunstack the blue block from on top of the red block\nstack the blue block on top of the white block\npick up the yellow block\nstack the yellow block on top of the red block\n[PLAN END]\n \n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table, the orange block is on the table, the yellow block is on the table and the white block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the white block is on top of the orange block, the red block is on the table, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",

A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the white block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the white block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the orange block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block and the white block is on top of the red block.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]\nunstack the red block from on top of the white block\nput down the red block\nunstack the white block from on top of the yellow block\nstack the white block on top of the red block\nunstack the orange block from on top of the blue block\nput down the orange block\npick up the blue block\nstack the blue block on top of the orange block\npick up the yellow block\nstack the yellow block on top of the blue block\n[PLAN END]\n \n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the white block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the white block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the orange block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is currently holding red block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the white block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",

A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the white block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on the table, the yellow block is on the table and the white block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the red block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the white block and the white block is on top of the blue block.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]\nunstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block\nput down the blue block\nunstack the red block from on top of the white block\nstack the red block on top of the yellow block\npick up the white block\nstack the white block on top of the blue block\npick up the orange block\nstack the orange block on top of the white block\n[PLAN END]\n \n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the white block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on the table, the yellow block is on the table and the white block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on the table, the orange block is on the table, the yellow block is on the table and the white block is on the table.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",

A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the white block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the white block.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]\nunstack the red block from on top of the yellow block\nput down the red block\nunstack the white block from on top of the orange block\nput down the white block\npick up the yellow block\nstack the yellow block on top of the white block\nunstack the orange block from on top of the blue block\nput down the orange block\npick up the blue block\nstack the blue block on top of the yellow block\n[PLAN END]\n \n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the white block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the red block is clear, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is currently holding blue block, the yellow block is on top of the white block, the red block is on the table, the orange block is on the table and the white block is on the table.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",

A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the orange block is on top of the red block.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]\nunstack the red block from on top of the orange block\nput down the red block\npick up the orange block\nstack the orange block on top of the red block\n[PLAN END]\n \n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is currently holding red block, the blue block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",

A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table and the blue block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the red block and the orange block is on top of the blue block.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]\nunstack the orange block from on top of the red block\nput down the orange block\npick up the blue block\nstack the blue block on top of the red block\npick up the orange block\nstack the orange block on top of the blue block\n[PLAN END]\n \n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table and the blue block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",

A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the red block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block and the blue block is on top of the orange block.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]\npick up the red block\nstack the red block on top of the blue block\n[PLAN END]\n \n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the red block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the blue block is clear, the hand is currently holding red block, the blue block is on top of the orange block and the orange block is on the table.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",

A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block and the blue block is on top of the orange block.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]\nunstack the red block from on top of the blue block\nput down the red block\npick up the blue block\nstack the blue block on top of the orange block\npick up the red block\nstack the red block on top of the blue block\n[PLAN END]\n \n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the blue block is clear, the hand is currently holding red block, the blue block is on top of the orange block and the orange block is on the table.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",

A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the red block and the red block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]\nunstack the blue block from on top of the orange block\nput down the blue block\nunstack the orange block from on top of the red block\nput down the orange block\npick up the red block\nstack the red block on top of the blue block\n[PLAN END]\n \n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the red block and the red block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is currently holding red block, the blue block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",

A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on the table, the blue block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the orange block and the orange block is on top of the red block.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]\npick up the orange block\nstack the orange block on top of the red block\npick up the blue block\nstack the blue block on top of the orange block\n[PLAN END]\n \n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on the table, the blue block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the hand is currently holding orange block, the red block is on the table and the blue block is on the table.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",

A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the blue block and the red block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the orange block is on top of the red block.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]\nunstack the orange block from on top of the blue block\nput down the orange block\nunstack the blue block from on top of the red block\nput down the blue block\npick up the orange block\nstack the orange block on top of the red block\n[PLAN END]\n \n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the blue block and the red block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the hand is currently holding orange block, the red block is on the table and the blue block is on the table.\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",
