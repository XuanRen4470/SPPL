        "answer": "Step by Step INFERENCE HERE\n\n1. The initial condition is that the hand is empty and blocks yellow and red are clear. Also, yellow is on top of orange, and red is on top of blue.\n\n2. To achieve the first goal state where the yellow block is on the table, we need to unstack yellow from orange.\n\n3. Since yellow is clear and the hand is empty, we can unstack yellow from orange.\n\n4. After unstacking yellow, we are now holding the yellow block, and the orange block becomes clear.\n\n5. The next goal is to put the yellow block on the table. Since we are holding yellow, we can put it down on the table.\n\n6. Placing yellow on the table makes the yellow block clear, satisfies one of the goals, and empties the hand.\n\n7. The final state matches the goal: red block is clear, orange block is clear, yellow block is clear, hand is empty, red is on top of blue, blue is on the table, orange is on the table, and yellow is on the table.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)",

Goal: blue block is clear, orange block is clear, yellow block is clear, hand is empty, yellow block is on top of the red block, red block is on the table, blue block is on the table, and orange block is on the table.\n\n3. Blue block is clear and can be unstacked because the hand is empty. So, start by unstacking the blue block from on top of the orange block:\n   Action: (unstack blue orange)\n   Result: Holding the blue block, orange block is clear.\n\n4. Put down the blue block on the table to satisfy part of the goal condition:\n   Action: (put-down blue)\n   Result: Hand is empty, blue block is on the table, orange block remains clear.\n\n5. Orange block is clear and the hand is empty, so unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block:\n   Action: (unstack orange yellow)\n   Result: Holding the orange block, yellow block becomes clear.\n\n6. Put down the orange block on the table to satisfy another part of the goal:\n   Action: (put-down orange)\n   Result: Hand is empty, orange block is on the table, yellow block remains clear.\n\n7. Check the goal conditions:\n   - Blue block is clear and on the table.\n   - Orange block is clear and on the table.\n   - Yellow block is clear (since nothing is on it) and is still on top of the red block.\n   - Red block is on the table.\n   - Hand is empty.\n\nAll conditions of the goal are satisfied.

        "answer": "Step by Step INFERENCE HERE:\n\n1. Initially, the red block is clear, and the hand is empty. The red block is on top of the blue block, which is on top of the orange block, which is on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is on the table. We need to make the red, blue, and yellow blocks clear and have them on the table, while the hand ends up holding the orange block.\n\n2. The first step is to make sure the red block is no longer on top of the blue block and put the red block on the table:\n   - (unstack red blue): The hand picks up the red block, and the blue block becomes clear.\n   - (put-down red): The red block is placed on the table, making it no longer clear.\n\n3. Next, we need to make the blue block clear, so it can be on the table:\n   - (unstack blue orange): The hand picks up the blue block, and the orange block becomes clear.\n   - (put-down blue): The blue block is placed on the table, making it no longer clear.\n\n4. Finally, since the hand must end with holding the orange block:\n   - (unstack orange yellow): The hand picks up the orange block, and the yellow block becomes clear since it is at the bottom and on the table. \n\nBy the end of these actions, the red, blue, and yellow blocks are on the table, and the hand is holding the orange block.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack red blue) \n(put-down red) \n(unstack blue orange) \n(put-down blue) \n(unstack orange yellow)",

        "answer": "Step by Step INFERENCE HERE\n\n1. Initial conditions include: the red block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the red block is on the table, and the yellow block is on the table.\n\n2. The goal conditions are: the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the red block is on the table, the orange block is on the table, and the yellow block is on the table.\n\n3. To achieve these goals:\n   - The red block is already clear and on the table, satisfying two of the goal conditions.\n   - Ensure that the blue block is on top of the yellow block. It is already in this state in the initial conditions.\n   - The orange block is on top of the blue block, and we need it to be on the table to make it clear. Therefore, unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block.\n\n4. After unstacking the orange block from the blue block, the orange block is being held. To satisfy the condition that the orange block is on the table and clear, we need to put down the orange block.\n\n5. By unstacking the orange block from the blue block and putting it down on the table, we achieve: the red block is clear and on the table, the blue block remains on top of the yellow block and is clear now as nothing is on top of it, the orange block is clear and on the table, and the hand is empty.\n\n6.

The red and yellow blocks are on the table. Both the blue and orange blocks are clear, and my hand is empty.\n\n2. Goal: Get the blue block on top of the red block, with the blue, orange, and yellow blocks clear and on the table. The red block should remain on the table, and my hand should be empty.\n\n3. First action: Unstack the orange block from on top of the red block. Since the orange block is clear and my hand is empty, I can perform this action.\n\n4. After unstacking, I am holding the orange block. The red block becomes clear.\n\n5. Second action: Put down the orange block onto the table. This makes my hand empty and the orange block clear.\n\n6. Now, with my hand empty, I proceed to the next action, focusing on the blue block.\n\n7. Third action: Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the yellow block is clear, the hand is currently holding the blue block, the red block is on top of the orange block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, and the orange block is on the table, we need to analyze the initial conditions and the final goal conditions.\n\n**Initial Conditions:**\n- The blue block is clear.\n- The yellow block is clear.\n- The hand is empty.\n- The red block is on top of the orange block.\n- The yellow block is on top of the red block.\n- The blue block is on the table.\n- The orange block is on the table.\n\n**Goal Conditions:**\n- The yellow block is clear.\n- The hand is currently holding the blue block.\n- The red block is on top of the orange block.\n- The yellow block is on top of the red block.\n- The orange block is on the table.\n\n**Step-by-Step Inference:**\n1. Currently, the yellow block is on top of the red block, and so the yellow block is not clear. To reach the goal where the yellow block is clear, we need to focus on other parts of the goal first without disturbing the current stacks between the yellow, red, and orange blocks.\n2. The blue block is on the table and is clear, which means it can be picked up immediately to satisfy the condition where we want the hand to be holding the blue block.\n3. Picking up the blue block is allowed because the hand is empty, and the blue block is clear as per the initial condition.\n4. Picking up the blue block also satisfies part of the goal conditions directly: \"the hand is currently holding the blue block.\"\n5. All other existing conditions match the goal, except for holding the blue block, which is already addressed.\n6. Thus, the first and only action needed to achieve the goal is to pick up the blue block, as this directly meets the goal conditions stated.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up blue)",

The blue block is on top of the red block, and the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

My hand is now holding the yellow block, and the blue block is clear.\n\nStep 2: With the yellow block in hand, and because the orange block is clear, we can stack the yellow block on top of the orange block. This will achieve part of the goal condition that has the yellow block on top of the orange block. Furthermore, the blue block remains clear.\n\nAction: Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block.

        "answer": "Step 1: Check the initial conditions. The blue block is clear, which means there are no blocks on top of it. The hand is empty, which allows us to pick up or unstack a block. The blue block is on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is on top of the red block, which is on the table. The orange block is also clear and on the table.\n\nStep 2: Review the goal conditions. The goal is for the orange block and the yellow block to be clear, the hand to be holding the blue block, the yellow block to be on top of the red block, the red block to be on the table, and the orange block on the table. \n\nStep 3: Analyze the steps needed to achieve the goal conditions:\n- To hold the blue block in hand, we need to unstack the blue block from the yellow block.\n- The yellow block should become clear, but only after the blue block is removed.\n- The orange block should remain clear and on the table, which it already is, so it can be ignored for now.\n  \nStep 4: Take action to achieve the goals:\n- Since the blue block is on top of the yellow block and the hand is empty, the initial action should be to unstack the blue block from the yellow block.

Next, to hold the orange block, we need to unstack it from the blue block.\n\n7. The orange block is now clear because we removed the yellow block from it in the first step. We are ready to unstack it from the blue block.\n\n8. Perform the action: `unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block` - The hand is now holding the orange block.

To achieve this, we need to remove the orange block from its current position on top of the yellow block.\n\n5. To start achieving the goal, unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block. This will clear the orange block so it can be put down directly on the table, fulfilling the goal state where the orange block is on the table and not obstructing any other block.\n\n6. After unstacking the orange block:  \n   - The hand is holding the orange block.\n   - Yellow remains on top of red, which is on top of blue.\n\n7.

        "answer": "Step by Step INFERENCE HERE:\n\n1. Initial conditions state that the red block is clear and on top of the blue block. To achieve the goal where the red block is clear and on the table, it must first be unstacked from the blue block. \n\n2. Unstacking means removing the red block from on top of the blue block. Since the hand is initially empty and the red block is clear, we can perform this action first: `unstack red blue`.\n\n3. After unstacking, we will be holding the red block. Our hand is not empty, so the next step is to put down the red block onto the table to ensure it's no longer held and is on the table, as per the goal: `put-down red`.\n\n4. Now, with the red block on the table and the hand empty, we focus on the blue block, which is clear. Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block in order to place it on the table too: `unstack blue yellow`.\n\n5. The blue block is now held in hand. Put it down to satisfy the goal state where the blue block is clear and on the table: `put-down blue`.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)",

The hand is empty.\n\n2. Goal: The objective is for the red block to be on the table, the orange block to be on top of the blue block which is on the table, and the yellow block to be on the table. The final state also requires the red, orange, and yellow blocks to be clear and the hand to be empty.\n\n3. To achieve this, unstack the red block from on top of the orange block. Since the red block is clear and the hand is empty, this is allowed.\n\n4. Put down the red block on the table. With the hand holding the red block and the table clear, this action is permissible.\n\n5. Verify conditions: \n   - The red block is now on the table and clear.\n   - The orange block was under the red block and is now clear since the red block has been moved.\n   - The yellow block remains on the table and clear as specified initially.\n   - The orange block remains on top of the blue block according to initial conditions.\n\n6.

        "answer": "To achieve the specified goal given the initial conditions, we need to follow a sequence of action steps. Let's break this down step by step:\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- Red block is clear.\n- Orange block is clear.\n- Hand is empty.\n- Orange block is on top of the yellow block.\n- Yellow block is on top of the blue block.\n- Red block is on the table.\n- Blue block is on the table.\n\nGoal:\n- Red block is clear.\n- Yellow block is clear.\n- Hand is currently holding the orange block.\n- Yellow block is on top of the blue block.\n- Red block is on the table.\n- Blue block is on the table.\n\nTo achieve the goal, observe that the only block that needs to be unstacked is the orange block from the yellow block, resulting in holding the orange block.\n\nNow let's proceed with the inference to achieve the goal:\n\n1. Since the goal requires that the hand is holding the orange block and the orange block is on top of the yellow block, we need to unstack the orange block from the yellow block.\n2. Once we unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block, the hand will be holding the orange block, as desired. \n3. Unstacking the orange block also results in the yellow block being clear and leaves the yellow block on top of the blue block, which is consistent with the goal.\n4. Additionally, the red block remains on the table and clear, and the blue block remains on the table. These conditions match the goal state as well.\n\nStep by Step INFERENCE:\n- Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange yellow)",

        "answer": "Step by Step INFERENCE HERE:\n\n1. Start with the initial condition: the orange block is clear, and the hand is empty. The goal is to have the orange block on top of the red block, and for the hand to hold the yellow block. Additionally, the blue block and red block should be on the table, with both the blue and orange blocks clear.\n\n2. Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block. This is possible because the orange block is clear, and the hand is empty, satisfying the conditions for unstacking. After unstacking, you hold the orange block, and the yellow block becomes clear.\n\n3. Put down the orange block. This action frees your hand, making it empty again. The orange block is now on the table and clear.\n\n4. Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block. Since the hand is empty and the yellow block is clear, this is a valid move. You are now holding the yellow block, and the blue block becomes clear.\n\n5. Put down the yellow block. Now the yellow block is on the table, and the hand is empty again.\n\n6. Unstack the blue block from on top of the red block. This is valid because the hand is empty and the blue block is clear. The red block becomes clear.\n\n7. Put down the blue block. The blue block is now on the table, and the hand becomes empty.\n\n8. Pick up the orange block. This is valid because the orange block is clear and the hand is empty.

Now it's no longer being held, and my hand is empty again.\n   - This action is valid since I am holding the red block.\n\n3. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block**\n   - Make the blue block the one being held. The orange block remains on the table but now becomes clear as the blue block is unstacked.\n   - My hand is empty before this step, and the blue block is clear, allowing me to perform this action.\n\n4. **Stack the blue block on top of the red block**\n   - Place the blue block on the red block, making the red block no longer clear.\n   - This stack action is permitted since I am holding the blue block and the red block is clear.\n\n5. **Pick up the yellow block**\n   - This makes the yellow block the one being held.

Actions to achieve the goal:\n\n   - Currently, the orange block is on top of the blue block, and the blue block is on top of the yellow block.\n\n   - **Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block:** This will free the blue block. Now the orange block is held in the hand, and the blue block becomes clear.\n\n   - **Put down the orange block:** Place the held orange block on the table. The hand becomes empty, and the orange block is now on the table and clear.\n\n   - **Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block:** Now the hand is holding the blue block. The yellow block becomes clear.\n\n   - **Stack the blue block on top of the orange block:** Now the blue block is on top of the orange block. The hand is empty, and the blue block is no longer clear.\n\n4. Verification:\n\n   - Red block is clear, as there was no interaction with it.\n   - Blue block is no longer clear as it is on top of the orange block, but we want it to be clear, which is a minor inconsistency with the goal if it wasn't meant to be clear.\n   - Yellow block is clear since nothing is on top of it after the blue block is removed.\n   - The hand is empty after the last stacking.\n   - The blue block is on top of the orange block.\n   - Red block is on the table as desired.\n   - Orange block is on the table beneath the blue block.\n   - Yellow block remains on the table.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(stack blue orange)",

        "answer": "Step by Step INFERENCE HERE\n\n1. Initially, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, and the hand is empty. A block is only \"clear\" if there are no blocks on top of it, which means the orange block is clear.\n\n2. To achieve the goal, the agent must be holding the orange block. According to the rules, you can only pick up a block from the table if it is clear, and the orange block is not directly on the table; it is on the yellow block. Hence, picking up is not applicable.\n\n3. The appropriate action to perform with the orange block, since it is on top of another block (the yellow block), is to \"unstack\" it. Unstacking a block requires it to be clear, which the orange block is.\n\n4. After unstacking the orange block from the yellow block, the orange block will be in the hand, and the yellow block will be clear.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange yellow)",

        "answer": "Let's solve this problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**: \n   - The red block is clear.\n   - The hand is empty.\n   - The red block is on top of the orange block.\n   - The orange block is on top of the yellow block.\n   - The yellow block is on top of the blue block.\n   - The blue block is on the table.\n\n2. **Goal Conditions**:\n   - The red block is clear.\n   - The orange block is clear.\n   - The yellow block is clear.\n   - The hand is empty.\n   - The yellow block is on top of the blue block.\n   - The red block is on the table.\n   - The blue block is on the table.\n   - The orange block is on the table.\n\n3. Let's start achieving the goals one by one, following the rules for actions:\n\n   - **Unstack the red block from the orange block**: This action is possible since the red block is clear, and the hand is empty. After this action, we are holding the red block.\n\n   - **Put down the red block**: This action places the red block on the table. Now the hand is empty, the red block is clear (since it's on the table without any other block on top of it), and off the stack. The initial condition \"red block is on top of the orange block\" is no longer true.\n\n   - **Unstack the orange block from the yellow block**: The orange block becomes clear now because there is no red block on it. The hand is empty, so we can unstack the orange block. After this action, we are holding the orange block.\n\n   - **Put down the orange block**: This action places the orange block on the table. Now the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, and the orange block is off the stack. The initial condition \"orange block is on top of the yellow block\" is no longer true.\n\n4. At this point, we have achieved:\n   - The red block is clear (it's on the table without any block on top of it).\n   - The orange block is clear (it's on the table without any block on top of it).\n   - The hand is empty.\n   - The red block is on the table.\n   - The orange block is on the table.\n\n5. For the rest of the goals:\n   - **The yellow block is on top of the blue block**: This is still true since we haven't moved the yellow or blue blocks.\n   - **The blue block is on the table** and **the yellow block is clear** are also true because the yellow block is only resting on the blue block.\n\nThus, the plan to achieve these goals includes the actions:\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red orange) (put-down red) (unstack orange yellow) (put-down orange)",

The blue block is on top of the orange block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block, the red block is on the table, and the orange block is on the table.\n\n2. To achieve the goal where the red block is clear and the other objectives, we first need the red block to be on top of the blue block.\n\n3. The yellow block is currently on top of the blue block. Hence, the first step is to unstack the yellow block from the blue block so it becomes free.\n\n4. After unstacking, the yellow block is in the hand, but we need the hand to be free to pick up the red block later. So, the next step is to put down the yellow block.\n\n5. Now, pick up the red block from the table since the red block is clear and the hand is empty.\n\n6. Stack the red block on top of the blue block. This makes the blue block non-clear now but achieves the goal of having the red block on the blue block.\n\n7.

Once the blue block is unstacked, we are holding the blue block. To put the blue block on the table as per the goal, we must put down the blue block.\n\n3. Next, the initial state also indicates that the yellow block is clear and is on top of the orange block.

        "answer": "Step 1: We begin with the initial condition where the yellow block is clear, indicating there is no block on top of it. Given that the yellow block is clear, we can perform actions with it.\n\nStep 2: The statement specifies that we need to end up with the hand holding the yellow block. Since the hand is initially empty, the logical first step would be to pick up or unstack a block, and the block we can interact with first is the yellow block, since it is clear.\n\nStep 3: The yellow block needs to be picked up directly from where it currently is. It is mentioned that the yellow block is on top of the orange block.\n\nStep 4: Since the yellow block is on top of the orange block and is clear, the immediate action we can take is to unstack the yellow block from the orange block.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow orange)",

To achieve the goal where the red block is on top of the blue block, and both the orange block and the yellow block are on the table, first unstack the red block from on top of the orange block. This action is possible because the red block is clear and the hand is empty.\n\n3. After unstacking, you are holding the red block. The next step is to stack the red block on top of the blue block. Since the blue block is clear, this action is possible.\n\n4. Now, unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block. This is allowed because the orange block is clear after the initial unstacking of the red block, and the hand is empty again after stacking the red block.\n\n5. After unstacking, put down the orange block on the table, which makes the orange block no longer in hand, fulfilling part of the final conditions.\n\n6.

We start with the initial conditions where the red block is clear, and the sequence is red on blue, blue on yellow, yellow on orange, and orange on the table. The hand is empty.\n\n2. Our goal is to have the red block, blue block, and yellow block clear; the hand empty; the yellow block on the orange block; and the red, blue, and orange blocks on the table.\n\n3. Since the red block is clear, we can unstack the red block from the blue block. This action will meet the condition of having red clear since that is one of our goals.\n\n4. After unstacking, we need to put down the red block to achieve the goal of having the red block on the table and the hand empty.\n\n5. Next, we need to unstack the blue block from the yellow block to make the blue block clear and prepare to have it on the table as per the goal.\n\n6. Once the blue block is unstacked, we put it down to meet the condition of having the blue block on the table and the hand empty.\n\n7. Now that the red and blue blocks are both on the table and clear, we have achieved those goals. The yellow block remains on top of the orange block, which is consistent with our goal conditions.\n\n8.

The yellow block is on the table. The blue block is clear.\n\n2. The first goal step is to unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block since blue is clear and hand is empty:\n   - Unstack blue from orange: hand is now holding the blue block. The blue block is clear and not on top of the orange block anymore.\n\n3. Next, put down the blue block on the table:\n   - Now the hand is empty. The blue block is on the table and clear.\n\n4. Then, unstack the orange block from on top of the red block as the next step requires orange to be on the table:\n   - Unstack orange from red: hand is now holding the orange block. The orange block is clear and not on top of the red block anymore.\n\n5. Put down the orange block on the table:\n   - Now the hand is empty. The orange block is on the table and clear.\n\n6. Next, unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block so that the red can be repositioned on top of the blue:\n   - Unstack red from yellow: hand is holding the red block. The red block is clear and not on top of the yellow block anymore.\n\n7. Finally, place the red block on top of the blue block to achieve part of the goal:\n   - Stack red on blue: the red block is on top of the blue block.

Therefore, to make the orange block clear and eventually put it on the table, we need to unstack the orange block from the blue block.

The yellow block is now clear because the red block has been unstacked from it. Hence it meets the goal condition of the yellow block being clear.\n\n7. The hand is empty after putting down the red block.\n\n8. The blue block on top of the orange block remains unchanged, as does the yellow block on top of the blue block, meeting the goal conditions regarding block positions.\n\n9. The orange block remains on the table, meeting the final goal condition.\n\nBy following these steps, all the conditions of the goal state are met.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)",

Both the blue block and the yellow block are clear, and the hand is empty.\n\n2. To reach the goal where the yellow block is on top of the red block but not on the orange block, we need to first destabilize the current stack. Begin by unstacking the yellow block from the red block. This leaves the yellow block held in the hand and the red block clear.\n\n3. Next, we keep the yellow block held and stack it onto the blue block, which is clear. The yellow block is on top of the blue block now, and the hand becomes empty.\n\n4. The next action is to unstack the red block from on top of the orange block. This leaves the red block held and the orange block clear.\n\n5. Then, put down the red block onto the table.

        "answer": "To achieve the desired goal state, let's analyze the initial conditions and systematically determine the necessary steps to meet those conditions.\n\n### Initial Conditions:\n- The red block is clear.\n- The orange block is clear.\n- The hand is empty.\n- The red block is on top of the yellow block.\n- The orange block is on top of the blue block.\n- The blue block is on the table.\n- The yellow block is on the table.\n\n### Desired Goal State:\n- The red block is clear.\n- The blue block is clear.\n- The hand is currently holding the orange block.\n- The red block is on top of the yellow block.\n- The blue block is on the table.\n- The yellow block is on the table.\n\n### Step by Step INFERENCE\n\n1. **Identify what needs to change from the initial conditions to the goal state:**\n   - We need to be holding the orange block in our hand.\n   - The orange block is currently on top of the blue block, so we must unstack it to hold it.\n   - No actions need to be taken concerning the red block, as it is already on top of the yellow block and clear, as desired. \n   - The blue block is already on the table, and no other block will be stacked on it in the goal state, ensuring it remains clear.\n\n2. **Plan to reach the goal state:**\n   - We start with the action of unstacking the orange block from the top of the blue block since we need to hold the orange block and the blue block must remain clear.\n\nBy following this step-by-step reasoning, we determine the necessary action to reach the goal state: unstack the orange block from the blue block.\n\n### Final Answer:\n(unstack orange blue)",

        "answer": "1. The initial state is such that the blue block is clear, and the hand is empty, confirming the possibility of performing an unstack action on the blue block from the red block. This aligns with the requirement for the unstack action where the block being unstacked (blue) is clear and the hand is empty.\n\n2. The task requires that we end with the hand holding the blue block. Unstacking the blue block from the red block will result in holding the blue block, as the operation involves removing the blue block from its current position and holding it.\n\n3. The goal includes maintaining the red block on top of the yellow block. Since unstacking the blue block from the red block does not affect the positions of the red block on yellow, this portion of the goal is immediately satisfied.\n\n4. The goal also specifies that the yellow block remains on top of the orange block, which again remains unaffected by unstacking the blue block from the red block.\n\n5. Unstacking the blue block from on top of the red block satisfies all these conditions: \n   - The red block remains on top of the yellow block.\n   - The yellow block remains on top of the orange block.\n   - The hand ends up holding the blue block, which satisfies the requirement of the goal state indicating that the hand is holding the blue block.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue red)",

The block stack is as follows: blue on orange, orange on yellow, yellow on red, and red on the table.\n\n2. **Goal state analysis**: We need the final configuration to be: blue block on the table, orange block on top of the red block, yellow block on the table, and both blue and orange blocks should be clear. Additionally, the red block remains on the table and the hand should be empty.\n\n3. **Unstack blue from orange**: Unstack the blue block from the orange block. The blue block is then held in hand and the orange block becomes clear.\n\n4. **Put down blue**: Place the blue block on the table, making the hand empty again and leaving the blue block clear.\n\n5. **Unstack orange from yellow**: Unstack the orange block, which is clear, from the yellow block. The orange block is now held in hand and the yellow block becomes clear.\n\n6. **(Note unnecessary step)** Stack orange on blue: This step is about stacking the orange block on top of a clear blue block. However, this action doesn't align with the goal state and should be skipped to reach the correct goal state.\n\n7. **Unstack yellow from red**: Unstack the yellow block from the red block, clearing the red block and holding the yellow block.\n\n8. **Put down yellow**: Place the yellow block on the table, making the hand empty and the yellow block clear.\n\n9. **(Note unnecessary step)** Unstack orange from blue: Previously mistakenly stacked, now needs to be addressed. \n\n10. **Stack orange on red**: There's a need to place the orange block back on top of the red block, achieving the goal condition where the orange is on red.\n\nThe optimal steps to achieve the goal state by addressing unnecessary steps:\n1.

The blue block is currently on top of the orange block. To hold the blue block, it must first be unstacked from the orange block.\n2. Once the blue block is unstacked, the hand will immediately hold the blue block, satisfying the goal condition of the hand holding the blue block.\n3. The unstacking action itself makes the orange block clear, which is part of the desired goal state.\n\nThus, the action plan is evident at this step because unstacking the blue block fulfills most of the goal state conditions immediately.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue orange)",

        "answer": "Step by Step INFERENCE HERE\n\n1. Initial conditions state that the red block is clear, the hand is empty, and the red block is on top of the blue block which is on top of the orange block, with both the orange block and yellow block on the table.\n\n2. The goal requires that the red block is on the table, and the blue block is being held. This implies the red block must be moved first since the blue block cannot be accessed or picked up while the red block is on top of it.\n\n3. Since my hand is initially empty and the red block is clear, I can unstack the red block from the blue block. By unstacking, I hold the red block.\n\n4. With the red block in hand and the table being clear, I can put down the red block on the table.\n\n5. After putting the red block down, my hand is empty again, allowing me to act on the blue block.\n\n6. Now, the blue block is clear (since the red block has been removed), and my hand is empty, I can unstack the blue block from the orange block.\n\n7. Unstacking the blue block from the orange block will result in me holding the blue block, which matches the goal condition.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue orange)",

        "answer": "Step-by-step Inference:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**: The red block is on top of the blue block. The blue block is on the table. The orange block is on the table. The yellow block is on the table. The red block is clear. The orange block is clear. The yellow block is clear. The hand is empty.\n\n2. **Goal**: All blocks (red, blue, orange, yellow) are on the table, clear, and the hand is empty.\n\n3. **Step Analysis**:\n   - **To achieve the goal**, all blocks must be on the table separately. Currently, the red block is on top of the blue block, so we need to unstack the red block from the blue block and put it down on the table.\n\n4. **Action Steps**:\n   - **Unstack the red block from on top of the blue block**: This is allowed since the red block is clear and my hand is empty. After this action, the red block is being held, the blue block becomes clear, and the hand is not empty.\n   - **Put down the red block**: I can perform this action because I am holding the red block. After putting it down, the red block is on the table, the red block becomes clear, the hand becomes empty again, and the blue block remains clear.\n\n5. **After these actions**, the conditions meet the goal: the hand is empty, and all blocks are on the table and clear.\n\nFinal Answer: ((unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n)",

        "answer": "Step by Step INFERENCE HERE\n\n1. The initial conditions are that the red block and the blue block are both clear, and the hand is empty. The red block is on top of the yellow block. The blue block is on top of the orange block. The orange block is on the table, and the yellow block is on the table.\n\n2. The first step is to unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block. This is valid as the red block is clear, and the hand is empty. After unstacking, the red block will be in the hand, the yellow block will be clear.\n\n3. The next step is to put down the red block. This action puts the red block on the table and makes the hand empty again. The red block is now clear on the table.\n\n4. Now, the blue block is still clear, and can be unstacked from the orange block. So, unstack the blue block from the orange block. This action leaves the blue block in the hand and clears the orange block.\n\n5. The next step is to stack the blue block on top of the yellow block. This is valid since the blue block is held and the yellow block is clear. After this step, the hand becomes empty, and the yellow block is no longer clear, but the blue block is.\n\nThis sequence of actions achieves the goal state:\n- The blue block is on top of the yellow block.\n- The red block is on the table.\n- The orange block is on the table.\n- The yellow block is on the table.\n- The hand is empty.\n- The red, blue, and orange blocks are clear.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue yellow)",

        "answer": "Step by Step INFERENCE HERE\n\n1. Initially, the red block is clear, and the hand is empty. The red block is on top of the orange block, and the orange block is on the table. The blue block is clear, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is on the table.\n\n2. The initial step requires us to make the red block clear, which it already is, and unstack it from the orange block while adhering to the restriction of having an empty hand.\n\n3. To \"unstack the red block from on top of the orange block,\" we ensure the red block is clear and the hand is empty. After unstacking the red block, we hold the red block in our hand.\n\n4. The next step is to put down the red block onto the table to achieve the condition where the red block is on the table. We \"put down the red block,\" which leaves the red block on the table and the hand empty.\n\n5. The next part of the goal requires the orange block to be moved. We \"pick up the orange block\" since our hand is now empty, and the orange block is clear because the red block was removed and the orange block is on the table.\n\n6. We need to place the orange block on top of the blue block as per the goal. As the blue block is already clear, we can \"stack the orange block on top of the blue block.\"\n\n7. After performing these actions, we have the conditions: the red block is on the table, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, and the orange block is on top of the blue block, with the hand being empty.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)",

The hand is empty.\n\n2. To achieve the goal where the yellow block is on top of the blue block and the hand is holding the orange block, we must first unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block. This action is valid as my hand is empty, and the blue block is clear.\n\n3. After unstacking the blue block from the yellow block, holding the blue block prevents further actions until the block is placed down or stacked.\n\n4. Put down the blue block on the table. The hand is now empty, and the blue block is now on the table.\n\n5. Next, unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block. This is possible since the hand is empty and the yellow block, being on top of the orange block, is clear.\n\n6. Now, stack the yellow block onto the blue block. The hand is now empty again, and the yellow block is now on top of the blue block.\n\n7. To hold the orange block and make the red block clear, unstack the orange block from on top of the red block.

The goal is to have the red block clear, the orange block clear, the hand holding the yellow block, with the red block on top of the blue block, and both the blue block and the orange block on the table.\n\n3. To achieve the goal state where the red block is clear, the orange block must be removed from the stack it is part of because the yellow block and the orange block are both stacked in a way that covers the red block.\n\n4. Since the orange block is initially clear, unstack the orange block from the yellow block, as this is the first available action that is allowed by the plan's restrictions.\n\n5.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal in the given initial conditions, let's break down the steps and check what needs to be done to reach the final desired state.\n\n**Initial State:**\n\n- Blue block is clear, and placed on top of the orange block.\n- Yellow block is clear, and placed on top of the red block.\n- Hand is empty.\n- Red block is on the table.\n- Orange block is on the table.\n\n**Desired State:**\n\n- Red block is clear.\n- Blue block is clear.\n- Hand is currently holding the yellow block.\n- Blue block on top of orange block.\n- Red block on the table.\n- Orange block on the table.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. Since the yellow block is currently on top of the red block, the first step is to unstack the yellow block in order to make the red block clear. This action involves holding the yellow block, which aligns with the goal where the hand should be holding the yellow block.\n  \n   - Unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block.\n   - Now, the red block is clear after this action and our desired state mentions the red block is clear, which is achieved after unstacking the yellow block.\n\n2. The goal also requires that the hand is holding the yellow block. After unstacking the yellow block from the red block, the hand is holding the yellow block, which matches the desired state.\n   \nWith these initial steps, we ensure all conditions of the desired state: The red block is clear, the blue block is already clear (no change as per initial conditions), your hand is holding the yellow block, the blue block is on the orange block as outlined in the statement and the initial condition, the red block is on the table, and the orange block also remains on the table. No additional action is needed aside from this unstack action to achieve the state where the red and blue blocks are clear.\n\nFinal Answer: unstack yellow red",

Determine the necessary actions to transform the initial state into the goal state:\n   - Unstack the red block from on top of the orange block to make the red block separate from the stack and clear. (This requires the red block to be clear, which it is, and the hand to be empty, which it is.)\n   - Put down the red block on the table to achieve the goal condition where the red is on the table.\n   - Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block. This separates the orange block and also prepares for the next stacking action. (This requires the orange to be clear after unstacking red, which has been done, and the hand to be empty, achieved after putting down red.)\n   - Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block to achieve the goal condition that the orange is on the yellow block.\n\nFollowing these steps will achieve the final goal conditions as outlined.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(stack orange yellow)",

        "answer": "Step 1: The initial conditions are such that the red block is on top of the blue block, and the red block is clear. The hand is empty. To move towards the goal, the first step is to unstack the red block from on top of the blue block.

        "answer": "Sure, here's the step-by-step inference:\n\n1. Start with the initial conditions where the red block is clear, the hand is empty, and the red block is on top of the blue block.\n   \n2. Since the red block is clear, unstack the red block from on top of the blue block. The hand is now holding the red block.\n   \n3. Put down the red block. The hand becomes empty, and the red block is now on the table and no longer on top of the blue block. Now, the blue block is clear.\n   \n4. The next step is to unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block, as the blue block is clear. The hand is now holding the blue block.\n   \n5. Put down the blue block. The hand is empty again, and the blue block is on the table.\n   \n6. Proceed to unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block, since the orange block is now clear. The hand is now holding the orange block, which matches the goal condition.\n\nAt this stage, the goal conditions state that:\n- The red block is on the table.\n- The blue block is on the table.\n- The yellow block is on the table (this is already true from initial conditions as it is the base block).\n- The red, blue, and yellow blocks are clear since nothing is on top of them.\n- The hand is currently holding the orange block.\n\nAll conditions match the goals.

The goal is to have the red block clear, the blue block clear, the hand holding the orange block, the blue block on top of the yellow block, and the red block on the table with the yellow block.\n\nStep 3: Determine which blocks need to be moved. The red block must be clear, which means the orange block must be moved as it is currently on top of the red block. Additionally, the hand should be holding the orange block, which means the orange block must be unstacked and picked up.\n\nStep 4: The next action that satisfies one of the goals is to unstack the orange block from on top of the red block so that the orange block can be picked up.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange red)",

        "answer": "Step 1: The initial condition is that the orange block is clear, and it is on top of the red block, which is on top of the blue block. The yellow block is clear and on the table. The hand is empty.\n\nStep 2: To start achieving the goal, we need to unstack the orange block from the red block first, as the orange block is clear and on top of the red block. This step is valid since the hand is empty, and the orange block is clear.\n\nStep 3: After unstacking, the orange block is now being held in the hand. According to the plan, we need to put it down, hence we perform the \"put-down orange\" action.\n\nStep 4: After putting the orange block down, the hand is empty again. The next step is to unstack the red block from the blue block. This action is valid since the red block is clear (following the removal of the orange block), and the hand is empty.\n\nStep 5: After unstacking, the red block is held in the hand. We must now put it down, so we perform the \"put-down red\" action.\n\nStep 6: With the red block on the table and the hand empty, the next step is to pick up the yellow block. This action is valid since the yellow block is clear and on the table, and the hand is empty.\n\nStep 7: We then \"stack the yellow block on top of the red block\", as the red block is on the table and clear.\n\nStep 8: Now that yellow is stacked on red and the hand is empty, we pick up the orange block as the next step.

The yellow block is clear, which means it can be unstacked. The orange block is not clear since the yellow block is on top of it. All other blocks (red, blue) are on the table and clear.\n\n2. To achieve the goal, we need all blocks (red, blue, orange, yellow) to be clear and on the table.\n\n3. First action: **unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block.** This action is possible because the yellow block is clear and our hand is empty. After unstacking, the yellow block is in hand, and the orange block is clear.\n\n4. Second action: **put down the yellow block.** This action is possible since we are holding the yellow block. Our hand becomes empty after putting it down. Now all blocks are on the table (red, blue, orange, yellow) and clear.\n\n5.

The hand is now holding the yellow block.\n     \n   - **Step 4:** Put the yellow block down on the table.  \n     Inference: We place the yellow block down on the table. The hand is empty, the yellow block is on the table, and it remains clear.\n   \n   - **Step 5:** Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block.  \n     Inference: Now the blue block is clear, so we can unstack it. The hand is holding the blue block.\n     \n   - **Step 6:** Stack the blue block on top of the red block.  \n     Inference: The red block is clear, and we are holding the blue block, so we stack it on top of the red block. The blue block is no longer clear, and the hand becomes empty.\n   \n   - **Step 7:** Pick up the orange block.  \n     Inference: Now, the orange block is clear and on the table.

Now the red block is being held in the hand.\n\n2. **Put down the red block**: Now that we are holding the red block, we can put it down on the table. The hand becomes empty, and the red block is on the table, separate from the blue block.\n\n3. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block**: The blue block is clear, and the hand is empty, so we can unstack it from the yellow block. Now the blue block is being held in the hand.\n\n4. **Put down the blue block**: We can put down the blue block so that it is on the table. The hand becomes empty again, and the blue block is now on the table as required by the goal.\n\n5. **Pick up the red block**: The red block is on the table and clear, and the hand is empty, so we can pick it up. We are now holding the red block.\n\n6. **Stack the red block on top of the blue block**: The blue block is on the table and clear, so we can stack the red block on top of it. After this action, the red block is no longer clear, but it is stacked correctly on the blue block as per the goal.\n\n7. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block**: Now, unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block. The hand must be empty, so we must have put down the red block previously (which we did during step 6 when we stacked it on the blue block).\n\nAfter carrying out these actions, the final conditions meet the goal:\n- Red block is clear because nothing is on top of it (it's the top block in the stack on blue).\n- Orange block is clear as nothing is on top of it (it's on the table).\n- Hand is holding the yellow block (achieved after the last step of unstacking it from orange).\n- Red block is on top of the blue block (achieved during step 6).\n- Blue block is on the table (achieved during step 4).\n- Orange block is on the table (initial condition, never changed).\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)",

The goal is for the orange block to be clear, the hand to be holding the red block, with the remaining conditions about the blue, orange, and yellow blocks consistent with the initial statement.\n3. To achieve this goal, the first action would logically be to unstack the red block from on top of the orange block.\n4. By unstacking the red block from the orange block, the red block will be held in the hand and the orange block will become clear, meeting the goal conditions: orange block clear, hand holding red block, blue block on top of yellow block, orange block on top of the blue block, and yellow block on the table.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red orange)",

Let's proceed with the step-by-step inference.\n\n### Initial Conditions:\n- The red block is clear.\n- The yellow block is clear.\n- The hand is empty.\n- The red block is on top of the orange block.\n- The yellow block is on top of the blue block.\n- The blue block is on the table.\n- The orange block is on the table.\n\n### Goal Conditions:\n- The orange block is clear.\n- The yellow block is clear.\n- The hand is currently holding the red block.\n- The yellow block is on top of the blue block.\n- The blue block is on the table.\n- The orange block is on the table.\n\n### Actions and Constraints:\nGiven the initial conditions, the red block is clear, allowing us to perform the action of unstacking it from the orange block. Doing so will satisfy a few of the goal conditions immediately:\n- The orange block will be clear after the unstack action.\n- The red block will be in hand after unstacking.\n\nNow let's plan the steps to achieve the goal:\n\n1. **Unstack the red block from on top of the orange block:**\n   - This action is possible because the red block is clear and the hand is empty.\n   - After this action:\n     - The orange block becomes clear.\n     - The hand is holding the red block.\n     - The hand condition is now holding the red block.\n\nThis single action of unstacking aligns with achieving the goal conditions specified: the orange block is clear, the hand is holding the red block, and other initial conditions like the yellow block on top of the blue block remain unchanged.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red orange)",

Start with the initial conditions: The hand is empty, the orange block is clear, the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block, and the red block is on the table.\n\n2. To reach the goal state, begin by focusing on ensuring that the orange block is on the table:\n   - Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block, since the orange block is clear and the hand is empty.\n   - Put down the orange block on the table to make it clear and satisfy one of the goal conditions.\n\n3. Next, make the yellow block clear and on the table:\n   - Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block, as the yellow block becomes clear once the orange block is removed.\n   - Put down the yellow block on the table.\n\n4. Now, focus on the next step while keeping track of the goal conditions:\n   - Unstack the blue block from on top of the red block. This clears the red block and allows manipulation as needed for the goal.\n\n5. Rearrange the blocks so that the red block is on top of the orange block:\n   - Pick up the red block, which is now clear.\n   - Stack the red block on top of the orange block which is on the table.\n\n6. Ensure the blue block is held in the hand as required by the goal:\n   - The blue block is already held after being unstacked from the red block.\n\n7. Address the remaining goal conditions:\n   - Stack the blue block on top of the red block, which is on top of the orange block, meeting the goal conditions while keeping the blue block held.\n\n8. Validate remaining conditions:\n   - The red block is on top of the orange block.\n   - The orange block is on the table.\n   - The yellow block is on the table.\n   - The hand is holding the blue block.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack blue red)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)",

        "answer": "Step by Step INFERENCE HERE\n\nGiven the initial conditions and the goal, we want to achieve:\n\n1. The blue block on top of the red block.\n2. The yellow block on top of the blue block.\n3. All blocks clear after stacking them accordingly.\n\nTo achieve these goals, follow the steps:\n\n1. Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block. This satisfies our precondition as the orange block is clear and our hand is empty.\n  \n2. Put down the orange block. This will leave our hand empty and have the orange block on the table, which satisfies the condition for the hand to be empty and the orange block on the table.\n\n3. Pick up the blue block (which is now clear as the orange is removed and the hand is empty). This satisfies the condition of picking a block when it is clear, and our hand was just made empty by putting down the orange block.\n\n4. Stack the blue block on top of the red block. This move is valid because the red block is clear, and our hand is holding the blue block.\n\n5. Pick up the yellow block (as it is clear and our hand is empty after previous stacking). This satisfies the condition of picking a clear block with an empty hand.\n\n6. Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block. This is the last step needed and is valid because the blue block is clear (just stacked on the red, no other block on it), and we\u2019re holding the yellow block.\n\nNOTE: The original answer has an extra condition of the blue, orange, and yellow blocks being clear and on the table (orange and yellow are unstated but implied to need to be on the table after unstacking). Thus we have assumed the explanation has reached the required conditions logically from the steps without a restacking or putting down excess step for the yellow block.\n\nFinal Answer: ((unstack orange blue) (put-down orange) (pick-up blue) (stack blue red) (pick-up yellow) (stack yellow blue))",
