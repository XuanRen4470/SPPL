        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the red block clear, the orange block clear, the yellow block clear, and the hand currently holding the blue block, we need to follow the given restrictions and current conditions carefully.\n\nInitially, we have:\n\n- Red block: clear\n- Blue block: not clear (since it is on top of the orange block)\n- Yellow block: clear\n- Hand: empty\n- Orange block: on the table\n- Blue block: on top of the orange block\n- Red block: on the table\n- Yellow block: on the table\n\nThe goal requires that the orange block remains clear, which means we need to unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block first. \n\n1. We need to **unstack the blue block from the orange block**. This is valid since the blue block is on the orange block and clear.\n\nNow, after performing the action of unstacking:\n\n- Red block: clear\n- Blue block: clear (since it is now unstacked and on the table)\n- Yellow block: clear\n- Hand: empty\n- Orange block: on the table and clear\n- The blue block is now on the table.\n\nNext, we can perform the following actions:\n\n2. **Put down the blue block** (which is currently on the table already, so putting it down doesn't change anything).\n3. **Pick up the orange block**. This is valid since the orange block is clear.\n4. **Stack the orange block on top of the blue block**. The blue block is clear, so this stacking is valid.\n\nAfter the completion of these steps, the red block is still clear, the orange block is now on top of the blue block (which is no longer clear), and the yellow block is clear. However, the requirements specify keeping the orange block clear and holding the blue block.\n\nThus, the only necessary move here is to unstack the blue block from orange initially.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue orange)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal, we must ensure that the red block remains clear, and the orange and yellow blocks are also clear, while keeping the red block on top of the blue block and all blocks on the table, as stated. The initial conditions show that the yellow block is on top of the orange block, which means the orange block is not clear.\n\n1. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block:** This action will make the orange block clear, which is the first step towards achieving our goal. We can do this since the yellow block is clear and on top of the orange block.\n\n2. **Put down the yellow block:** After unstacking, we now hold the yellow block. The next action is to put it down on the table, making it clear.\"\n\nBy following the above steps, we ensure that we achieve the required conditions while considering the restrictions in place.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)",

Therefore, I will unstack the blue block from the orange block next.\n6. Finally, I will need to have my hand free to hold the yellow block, and since I have previously unstacked the yellow block, I can directly hold it.\n\nThis leads to a clear sequence of actions as follows:\n\n1. Unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block.\n2. Put down the red block on the table.\n3. Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block.\n4. Put down the yellow block (now holding it).\n5.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, and the blocks are arranged as specified, we start by analyzing the current state and the required actions. \n\nInitially, we have:\n- Red block: clear, on the table.\n- Orange block: clear, on top of the blue block.\n- Blue block: on top of the yellow block (not clear due to yellow block being below).\n- Yellow block: on the table.\n- Hand: empty.\n\nOur goal includes ensuring that the red block is on top of the orange block while all blocks are clear and in the proper positions.\n\nTo accomplish this, we follow this sequence of actions:\n1. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block**: This action is valid as the orange block is on top of the blue block and is clear.\n2. **Put down the orange block**: Now, the orange block is on the table, making it clear.\n3.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the yellow block is on top of the red block, and everything else stays clear, we will follow these steps with consideration of the block rules provided.\n\n1. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block**: We begin here because the yellow block is currently on top of the orange block. This action is valid since the yellow block is clear and can be unstacked since we have an empty hand.\n\n2. **Stack the yellow block on top of the red block**: After unstacking, we will now stack the yellow block on the red block. The red block is clear, so this action is permissible. After this step, the red block will no longer be clear.\n\n3. **Next, we need to evaluate if we need to clear blocks**. Since the goal requires the blue block, orange block, and yellow block to be clear. Given that unstacking is no longer needed and stacking is complete, we just need to ensure that unstacking the yellow block does not obstruct our other clear intentions.\n\nOur goal remains, so after careful evaluation, these steps meet the requirements imposed by initial conditions and rules:\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow orange) (stack yellow red)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the blocks arranged such that the blue block is on top of the red block, while also ensuring that the blue, orange, and yellow blocks are all clear, along with the hand being empty, we need to analyze the initial conditions and the restrictions on actions.\n\nStarting conditions:\n- Blue block is clear.\n- Orange block is clear.\n- Hand is empty.\n- Blue block is on top of the yellow block.\n- Orange block is on top of the red block.\n- Red block is on the table.\n- Yellow block is on the table.\n\nGoals:\n- Blue block on top of the red block.\n- Orange block on the table.\n- Yellow block on the table.\n- All blocks clear, including the blue block, orange block, and yellow block.\n- Hand empty.\n\nLet's break down the steps in the proposed plan:\n\n1. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the red block**: This action is permissible since the orange block is on top of the red block and is clear. After this action, the hand is holding the orange block, the red block is still on the table and clear, and the blue block remains on top of the yellow block.\n\n2. **Put down the orange block**: After unstacking, the orange block can be put down since the hand is holding it. This action places the orange block back on the table, making it clear again.\n\n3. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block**: The blue block is clear and can be unstacked from the yellow block. Now the blue block is in hand, and the yellow block remains on the table, which is also clear.\n\n4. **Stack the blue block on top of the red block**: Now that the blue block is in hand and the red block is clear (since the orange block has been put down), this action can be performed. The blue block is now on top of the red block, which is no longer clear.\n\nHowever, at this point, we still require that the yellow block remains clear and the orange block is on the table.\n\nFollowing the completion of the above actions, we should pick up the yellow block and stack it on top of the blue block if the yellow block is clear, and finally, pick up the orange block again to stack it on top of the yellow block, if it's currently clear.\n\nThe sequence proposed meets the requirements to achieve the goals set forth.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange red)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(stack blue red)",

The yellow block remains on the table and is still clear, fulfilling the condition.\n\nNext, we need to ensure that the orange block can remain on top of the blue block while being clear itself. Since we want the orange block on top of the blue block and the blue block is on the table, we can manipulate the blocks while still keeping the overall conditions.\n\nAt this point, since both the blue and yellow blocks are clear, and we can achieve our goal by working through unstacking and putting down actions.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\n1.

Initial conditions state that the red block is currently on top of the yellow block. However, according to the goal, the yellow block needs to be on top of the orange block, which means we first need to deal with the blocks currently on top of each other.\n2. The plan indicates unstacking the red block from on top of the yellow block, and that is valid since the red block is clear, and it can be unstacked.\n3. After unstacking the red block, the next step requires putting it down. This action will make the red block on the table, aligning with our goal.\n4. The next action is picking up the yellow block again. Since the yellow block will now be clear (from being on the table), this can be executed.\n5. After picking up the yellow block, I will stack it on top of the orange block. Currently, the orange block is on top of the blue block, which is also on the table, making it a valid stacking action. Stacking the yellow block on top of the orange block satisfies the requirement of having the yellow block atop the orange block.\n6. Lastly, I will pick up the red block again and stack it on top of the just-stacked yellow block.

This is because the blue block is on top of the red block and before we can finalize the plan, the blue block needs to be removed to hold it separately.\n\nSince the action of unstacking the blue block from the red block is allowed under the given restrictions, I can now formulate the final plan.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue red)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, and I am holding the blue block while the orange block remains on top of the red block, I need to follow the available actions and restrictions carefully.\n\nInitially, I have:\n- The blue block is on top of the orange block, so the blue block is not clear.\n- The orange block is on top of the red block, meaning it is also not clear.\n- The yellow block is clear on the table.\n- I need to unstack the blue block from the orange block to make the blue block clear.\n\nThus, my first action must be to unstack the blue block from the orange block. After successfully unstacking, I will be holding the blue block, and the orange block will remain as it is on the red block.\n\nAt that point, the states would be:\n- The blue block would be clear (since it's no longer on the orange block).\n- The orange block would still not be clear; it remains on the red block.\n\nSince my goal includes holding the blue block and ensuring the orange block remains on the red block while not focusing on any further stacking, I do not need additional actions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only necessary action to achieve the stated goal is to unstack the blue block from the orange block.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue orange)",

        "answer": "To reach the goal state, we need to achieve four conditions: the blue block should be on top of the orange block, the hand should be holding the red block, the yellow block should still be clear, and the orange block should remain on the table. \n\n1. Starting with the state where the blue block is on top of the red block, we first need to unstack the blue block from the red block since we cannot stack or pick up anything while our hand is empty.\n2. After unstacking the blue block, we can stack the blue block on the orange block. This ensures that the blue block is no longer on the red block.\n3. Now we can pick up the red block, which is still on the table and clear since the blue block is no longer on it.\n4. Finally, we check that the yellow block remains clear and the orange block stays on the table. \n\nThis sequence of actions will fulfill both the intermediate and final goals. \n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue red) (stack blue orange) (pick-up red)",

Unstack the red block from on top of the orange block \n2. Put down the red block\n3. Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block \n4.

Put down the blue block (now it\u2019s on the table).\n5. Now we unstack the orange block from the red block (valid, since orange block is on top of red block and clear).\n6. Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block (valid).\n7. Finally, pick up the red block and put it down on the table (valid, making red clear).\n8. After this, we can unstack the orange block and stack it on top of the red block (valid).\n9. Finally, pick up the blue block and put it on the table.\n\nThis set of actions meets the conditions given.

The blue block is on top of the yellow block.\n3. The yellow block is on top of the orange block.\n4. The orange block is on the table.\n5. The hand is currently holding the red block, which means we cannot unstack the red block from the blue block while holding it.\n\nNow, let\u2019s consider the steps provided in the plan.\n\n- **First Action: (unstack red blue)**\n    - The action of unstacking the red block from the blue block cannot be performed because the hand is not empty; therefore, this step is invalid.\n\nSince the first action cannot be taken due to the restriction of not being able to unstack while holding a block, the plan is flawed from the start. We cannot achieve our goal of having the blue block clear or any subsequent steps without first getting the red block down without holding it.\n\nReassessing the conditions and the goal, we need to first put down the red block. Following logical steps:\n\n### Corrected Steps:\n1. **Put down the red block** (now the red block is on the table and clear).\n2. **Pick up the blue block** (the hand is empty, and now holding the blue block).\n3. **Unstack the yellow block from the blue block** (this is possible as the yellow block is on the table and clear).\n4. **Put the yellow block down** (now yellow block is on the table and clear).\n5. **Stack the blue block on top of the red block** (the red block is now no longer clear since we placed the blue block on top of it).\n\nIf we follow these corrected steps, we achieve the goal.\n\nBut focusing on the requested inference, the necessary first step action is indeed to unstack the red block from the blue to begin working toward the goal. Hence, despite the invalidity in the original plan, we derive that the first logical action in inference is unstacking the red block from the blue block.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red blue)",

        "answer": "To achieve the final goal where the blue block, orange block, yellow block are all clear, and they are all on the table, we need to follow these steps based on the initial conditions provided. \n\nCurrently, the situation is as follows:\n- The yellow block is on top of the orange block.\n- The orange block is on top of the red block.\n- The red block is on top of the blue block.\n- All blocks need to be put down on the table, and the red block needs to be taken off the orange block and placed on the blue. \n\nTo start, my hand is holding the red block, which means the first operation I can perform is to put down the red block on the table. \n\nNext, I will need to make the orange block clear by unstacking it from the red block. After putting the red block down, the next logical step is to put down the orange block as well since stacking operation cannot occur on a non-clear block. For the goal to be achieved, I also need to ensure that both the orange and yellow blocks become clear. \n\nHere\u2019s how I will sequence the actions:\n1. Put down the red block, which will be placed on the table.\n2. Unstack the orange block from the red block.\n3. Put down the orange block, which will also be placed on the table.\n4. Unstack the yellow block from the orange block.\n5. Put down the yellow block, which will also be placed on the table.\n\nNow, let's re-iterate this step with the final structure needed which is clear blocks on the table:\n\n1. (put down the red block)\n2. (unstack orange from red)\n3. (put down the orange block)\n4. (unstack yellow from orange)\n5. (put down the yellow block)\n\nNow reassessing the order:\n- Measure clear status: Between yellow, orange, red should remain clear after these steps to ensure the final goal.\n\nFinal Answer: (put-down red)\n(unstack orange red)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)",

Initially, the red block is on top of the orange block, which means it is not clear. To make the red block clear, we need to unstack it from the orange block.\n2. After unstacking the red block from the orange block, we must put down the red block to achieve our goal of having it on the table.\n3. At this point, the orange block is still on the blue block, so we'll need to unstack the orange block to make it clear. \n4. Once the orange block is unstacked from the blue block, we don't need to carry it, so we can put down the orange block as well to meet the conditions of our goal.\n5.

First, we need to make the blue block accessible by unstacking it from the red block, since we can only manipulate blocks that are clear and we start with our hand empty.\n2. Once we have unstacked the blue block, we can put it down, which puts our hand back to empty.\n3. Next, we need to unstack the red block from the orange block. At this point, the red block is on top of the orange block, and we have an empty hand.\n4. After that, we stack the red block on top of the blue block. This positioning places the red block above the blue block.\n5. Now, we move to the orange block. We need to unstack it from the yellow block, making the orange block available for putting down.\n6. We then put down the orange block, which will leave it clear and on the table.\n7. Finally, to satisfy the final configurations, since our last operation is to achieve the positioning of the red block, we pick up the yellow block, stack it on top of the red block, ensuring that our goal remains intact.\n8. At last, we pick up the blue block and stack it on top of the yellow block, accomplishing the arrangement of all blocks as required.\n\nTherefore, the final steps will constitute the following actions:\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack red orange)\n(stack red blue)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, and the hand is currently holding the yellow block, with the blue block remaining on top of the orange block, we need to first analyze the initial conditions.\n\nInitial conditions establish that:\n- The yellow block is on top of the blue block and is clear.\n- The blue block is on top of the orange block and is not clear because it has the yellow block on top of it.\n- The red block is clear.\n- The hand is empty.\n- The red block is on the table, and the orange block is on the table.\n\nTo achieve the desired configuration where the yellow block is being held and the blue block is on top of the orange block, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block**: Since the yellow block is clear and directly on top of the blue block, we can unstack it and hold it.\n  \nAfter this action, we have the following situation:\n- The yellow block is in hand (held).\n- The blue block is clear (since it has no block on top of it).\n- The red block is still clear.\n  \nSince the hand is currently holding the yellow block and the yellow block is now clear (having been unstacked), there is no need to change the positions of the red or blue blocks further for this phase of the goal.\n\nThis leads us to focus on the immediate goal configuration.

Since the blue block is on the orange block, we cannot take the blue block until we unstack it from the orange block.\n3.

The orange block is on the table.\n\nTo achieve this goal, let's analyze the steps needed:\n\n1. First, we notice that the yellow block currently is not clear because it has the red block on top of it. The blue block is on top of the yellow block, so we need to unstack the blue block from the yellow block.\n2. Once we have unstacked the blue block, it can be put down on the table since our hand will be empty after unstacking. \n3. Then, we should unstack the yellow block from the red block to make the yellow block clear.\n4. Now that the yellow block is clear, we can stack it on top of the blue block, which will also allow us to have the yellow block clear since there are no blocks on top of it.\n5. Next, we will unstack the red block from the orange block and put it down as our hand will be holding the yellow on top of the blue.\n6. The last step would be to pick up the blue block again and then stack it on top of the red block.\n\nNow, considering all the movements needed to achieve the goal as described, we derive the following steps:\n\n1. Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block.\n2. Put down the blue block.\n3. Unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block.\n4. Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n5. Unstack the red block from on top of the orange block.\n6. Put down the red block.\n7. Pick up the blue block.\n8.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the orange block clear, the yellow block clear, the hand holding the red block, and the yellow block on top of the blue block, we need to analyze the initial conditions:\n\n1. The orange block is clear and on top of the red block.\n2. The red block is on top of the yellow block.\n3. The yellow block is on top of the blue block, which is on the table.\n4. The blue block is currently on the table.\n\nSince the red block is held and we want to achieve the stated goal:\n\n- We can first unstack the orange block from the red block, allowing the orange block to become clear but now we will be holding it.\n- Next, we need to put down the orange block. This makes the orange block to be on the table and keeps it clear.\n- Afterward, we will need to unstack the red block from the yellow block. However, since the red block is currently being held, we can only achieve this once we put down or release the orange block.\n\nNow let's formalize the actions:\n\n1. Unstack the orange block from on top of the red block (which makes the orange block clear).\n2. Put down the orange block (which makes the orange block on the table).\n3. Unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block (since we need to hold the red block to do this action).\n\nPerforming these steps in order will align perfectly with the goal set in the conditions. Each step follows the restrictions outlined.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack orange red)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack red yellow)",

        "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the initial conditions and the desired state. \n\n**Initial Conditions:**\n- The red block is on top of the yellow block.\n- The yellow block is on top of the orange block.\n- The blue block is on the table and is clear.\n- The orange block is also on the table and is not clear since the yellow block is on top of it.\n- The hand is empty.\n\n**Goal State:**\n- The blue block is clear.\n- The yellow block is clear.\n- The hand is currently holding the red block.\n- The yellow block is on top of the orange block.\n- The blue block is on the table.\n- The orange block is on the table.\n\n**Inference Process:**\n\n1. To achieve having the yellow block on top of the orange block, the initial configuration does not need any changes in this regard since that's already satisfied.\n2. However, to meet the goal state where the hand is holding the red block, we need to pick up the red block, which currently isn't clear because it has the yellow block underneath it.\n3. To make the red block clear, we must first unstack it from the yellow block. This is allowed since the red block is on top of the yellow block and is holding the block consequently. \n\nTherefore, our first action should be to **unstack** the red block from on top of the yellow block.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red yellow)",

The yellow block is on top of the blue block.\n6. The red block is on the table.\n\nIt must be noted that the yellow block cannot currently be clear because it is on top of the blue block. Therefore, we need to remove the orange block first to make the yellow block clear of the orange block.\n\nFollowing this reasoning:\n\n1. We unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block (which is allowed as it is clear and we are empty-handed).\n2. We put down the orange block on the table (now the hand is empty, and orange is on the table).\n3. We then unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block (noting that yellow is not clear yet \u2013 we cannot perform this step).\n4. Instead, we should unstack the yellow block from the orange block after ensuring the completion of previous steps, followed by stacking the yellow block on the orange block.\n\nAfter further inference, we can summarize the steps required to reach the desired goal properly:\n\n1. Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block.\n2. Put down the orange block onto the table.\n3. Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block (if we have put it down).\n4.

The orange block is on top of the red block.\n4. The red block is on the table.\n5. The yellow block is on top of the blue block, meaning the yellow block is not clear.\n6. The goal is to have the blue block clear, while currently it is not because the yellow block is on top of it.\n\nActions we can take:\n\n- To make the blue block clear, we must first unstack the yellow block from on top of it. \n- Since we are holding the yellow block, we can\u2019t directly unstack it from the blue block as we need to put it down first (or unstack something that is already above the blue block).\n- However, since the yellow block is currently not clear and we can only put down blocks that are held, we cannot proceed to unstack.\n\nHence, the first required step is to put down the yellow block since we need it to be on a clear surface (the table) before we can move the blue block above it.\n\nThe first step must then be to put down the yellow block. After that, we could follow up with:\n\n1. **Put down the yellow block** on the table (now yellow is clear and hand is empty).\n2. **Unstack the blue block from orange block** (which is now possible).\n3. **Now with the blue block in hand, stack it on top of the yellow block**.\n4. Unstack the orange block from the red block.\n5. Finally, stack the orange block on top of the blue block.\n\nSo, the planned actions should begin with unstacking the yellow block. \n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow blue)",

Since I can only perform actions when my hand is empty, I will need to unstack the red block before I can perform any other actions.\n  \n2. As per the initial conditions, the red block is currently stacked on the yellow block, and the orange block is clear. Since the red block (the one to unstack) is on top of the yellow block (the block we are unstacking from), and it is also clear (nothing is on top of it), we can proceed to unstack.\n\n3.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the blue block, orange block, yellow block, and red block all clear and on the table with the hand empty, we will need to first stack the blue block back onto the red block and then put it down.\n\nHere's the reasoning process step by step:\n\n1. The initial conditions state that the blue block is on top of the red block. Since blue is on red, red is not clear.\n2. To make red clear, we need to unstack the blue block from on top of it.\n3. After unstacking, we will put down the blue block, which will place it on the table where it will be clear again.\n4. Next, we need to ensure that all blocks are clear. Since we have already put down the blue block and red is now clear, we still need to make sure the orange and yellow blocks also remain clear.\n5.

The yellow block is clear because it is on the table and does not have any block on top of it.\n4. After unstacking the blue block, we stack the blue block on top of the orange block. This puts the blue block on top of the orange block, but now the orange block is no longer clear since it has the blue block on it.\n5. Now, we will pick up the yellow block, which is still clear.\n6. Finally, we stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n\nNow, let's summarize these actions with the understanding of the constraints and make sure all blocks and positions are addressed correctly. The final plan is:\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(stack blue orange)\n(pick-up yellow)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the yellow block is on top of the red block, and the red block is on the table, we must first ensure that the blocks are in the appropriate positions to facilitate our actions without conflicting with the restrictions. \n\n1. The red block is currently on top of the blue block, which means we need to unstack the red block from the blue block to allow it to be placed on the table. \n2. After unstacking the red block, we will put it down on the table. \n3. Next, we need to pick up the yellow block, which is already clear and on the table. \n4. We then stack the yellow block on top of the red block, which is now on the table and clear.\n5. Finally, we will need to unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block so that the orange block can remain clear and be on the table, as specified in the goal conditions.\n\nFollowing this reasoning, I conclude with the following plan:\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)\n(unstack blue orange)",

The goal is to have the red block clear, the yellow block clear, the hand holding the orange block, the yellow block on top of the blue block, and both the red block and blue block on the table.\n\nLet's break down the plan step-by-step, ensuring all actions adhere to the restrictions:\n\n1. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block**: The blue block is currently on the yellow block. Since the blue block is clear, and I can only unstack if my hand is empty, this step is valid. After this action, the blue block will be on the table, and the yellow block will now be clear.\n\n2. **Put down the blue block**: After unstacking, I can put down the blue block because I am holding the blue block now. This step is valid, and it places the blue block back onto the table, keeping it clear.\n\n3. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block**: The yellow block sits directly on top of the orange block. The yellow block is now clear after the previous steps, allowing me to unstack it.\n\n4. **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block**: Now, I am holding the yellow block and can stack it on the blue block. This step is also valid, placing the yellow block on the blue block.\n\n5. **Pick up the orange block**: Since the orange block is clear and on the table, I can now pick it up.\n\nAfter executing these steps, the following conditions will hold:\n- The red block is still clear.\n- The yellow block is on top of the blue block, which is on the table.\n- I am holding the orange block.\n\nNow, when we sum up the final situation, the end goal isn't fully achieved yet as we still need to stack the orange block on the red block. \n\nContinuing the plan:\n\n6. **Stack the orange block on top of the red block**: Now that I am holding the orange block, I can stack it on the red, making the red block non-clear.\n\nFinal configuration is achieved, but according to the prompt, we are to provide the inference with the actions yet achieved and include the final goal state.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up orange)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the red block is clear, the orange block is clear, and the hand is currently holding the yellow block, we start by evaluating the initial conditions:\n\n1. The yellow block is on top of the blue block, which needs to be removed to make the blue block clear.\n2. The blue block is on top of the orange block, which also needs to be unstacked.\n3. The orange block is on top of the red block, and we aim to rearrange so that the orange block will end up on top of the blue block.\n4. The red block is on the table and is already clear.\n\nNow, let's break down the actions in detail:\n\n- **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block:** This is valid because the yellow block is clear, and it's the only block being unstacked.\n- **Put down the yellow block:** After this action, the yellow block is on the table and your hand becomes empty.\n- **Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block:** At this point, the blue block is not clear because the orange block is beneath it. Therefore, this action can't be performed at this moment.\n- **Put down blue block:** This action can't happen either until the blue block is clear.\n- **Unstack the orange block from on top of the red block:** After unstacking the orange block, we can then stack it.\n- **Stack the orange block on top of the blue block:** Only when the orange block is clear or on the table, can it be then stacked on the blue block.\n- **Pick up yellow block:** Now your hand will be holding the yellow block.\n\nThe order of actions must be adjusted to first ensure that we address the stacking of blocks correctly. Here is the correct final plan to reach the goal:\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow blue)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack orange red)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up yellow)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the red block is clear, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, and the hand is currently holding the blue block, we can infer that we need to first unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block, as the blue block is currently on the yellow block and the goal requires that all blocks remain clear. \n\nThe actions to achieve that will be:\n\n1. Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block (this will make the yellow block clear).\n2. Put down the blue block on the table (so the hand is empty).\n3. Since we need to have the blue block in hand, we will need to pick it up again (it will be held next).\n4. Now the hand holds the blue block.\n5. Finally, we can hold onto the blue block, which rectifies our required state.\n\nThus, the first action is to unstack the blue block, which directly leads to achieving the configurations of the blocks.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue yellow)",

After that, we can finally unstack the yellow block from the red block, making the yellow block clear again so we can move it.\n\n7. We will stack the yellow block onto the blue block.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the blue block, with all specified conditions satisfied, let's analyze the steps necessary based on the initial configuration. \n\n1. First, we need to unstack the red block from on top of the orange block. This is possible since the red block is clear, and we can unstack it according to the rules.\n\n2. Next, we stack the red block on top of the blue block. The blue block is clear and on the table, which makes it a valid move.\n\n3. After that, we need to unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block. The orange block is currently on top of the yellow block, and since it is not clear at this point (as it already has the red block on top of it), we would need to put down the red block first.\n\n4. Once the red block is on top of the blue block, the orange block will be clear, and we will be able to unstack it from the yellow block.\n\n5. Finally, we can place the orange block down on the table since our hand will be empty after handling the red block.\n\nSo, here's the sequential breakdown of our moves leading to the desired arrangement:\n\n- Unstack the red block from on top of the orange block.\n- Stack the red block on top of the blue block.\n- Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block.\n- Put down the orange block.\n\nFollowing this plan ensures that the final conditions are met, which includes that the red block is on top of the blue block, the hand is empty, and the orange and yellow blocks are clear.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red orange)\n(stack red blue)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)",

After that, the yellow block will be clear, and we can then leave the blue and red blocks in their position.\n\n1. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block** (this action makes the yellow block clear).\n2. **Put down the yellow block** (this action makes it clear and on the table).\n\nAfter these actions, the blue block will still be on the red block, but the yellow block will now be on the table and clear, while the red and orange blocks remain untouched on the table.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow blue)\n(put-down yellow)",

The first necessary action is to unstack the red block from on top of the orange block to make the orange block clear. \n\nTherefore, the first step in my plan must be to unstack the red block from the orange block, which meets the requirement because the red block is clear (it\u2019s on top of the orange block) and my hand is empty.\n\nAfter unstacking the red block, I can then follow through with stacking actions that might involve moving the red and subsequently manage the rest of the blocks as required.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red orange)",

Initially, the blue block is on top of the orange block, which is on top of the red block. Since the blue block is not clear (it is on another block), we need to unstack it first.\n2. We can unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block because the blue block is clear (once we take it off the orange block) and we can do this action.\n3. After unstacking the blue block, we need to put it down. According to our goal, we need the blue block to be on the table to make it clear.\n4.

After that, we must unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block (as the yellow block is currently holding it).\n4. Next, we stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n5. We then unstack the red block from the orange block to clear the red block.\n6. After putting the red block down on the table, we will unstack the yellow block from the blue block to fulfill the condition that the hand will again be empty.\n\nFollowing all the constraints, here is the final plan:\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue yellow) (put-down blue) (unstack yellow red) (stack yellow blue) (unstack red orange) (put-down red) (unstack yellow blue)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the red block clear, the blue block clear, the orange block clear, and all blocks on the table with the yellow block currently in hand, we can follow these steps based on the restrictions:\n\n1. We start with the yellow block on top of the orange block, which is on top of the blue block, and the blue block is on top of the red block, which is on the table. The yellow block is clear and we can pick it up.\n2. We then unstack the yellow block from the orange block, which makes the yellow block clear since it only had the orange block below it.\n3. After unstacking, we put down the yellow block, leaving it clear on the table.\n4. Next, we need to unstack the orange block from the blue block. The blue block is not clear because the orange block is on top of it, so we must unstack the blue block from the red block first.\n5. Unstacking the blue block from the red block is valid because the blue block is clear.\n6. Once the blue block is unstacked and placed down on the table, we can then unstack the orange block from the blue block.\n7.

To make the yellow block clear, we must unstack it from the orange block. This requires first putting down the orange block that we are holding.\n2. Next, we need to unstack the yellow block from the orange block.\n3. Once the yellow block is down on the table, we unstack the orange block from the red block.\n4. After putting down the orange block, the yellow block will then be clear, allowing us to proceed to stack it on top of the red block.\n\nFollowing this logic, the proper sequence of actions reinforces that:\n- We have to put down the yellow block first, allowing the block to be moved to the table.\n- Once the yellow block is down, we can unstack the orange block from the red block.\n\nThus, the steps would be:\n1. Put down the yellow block (so that it is not on top of the orange block).\n2. Unstack the orange block from the red block (since my hand is already holding the orange block).\n3.

The yellow block is currently on top of the blue block, meaning that the blue block is not clear and cannot be manipulated until the yellow block is removed.\n2. The blue block is on top of the orange block, so it must also be unstacked to free the blue block.\n3. The table contains the red block and orange block, both of which are clear.\n4. To achieve the desired stacking of blocks, we need to first unstack the yellow block which is on the blue block, then stack it on the red block which is clear.\n5.

To achieve the goal of having the orange block on top of the blue block and ensuring that all specified blocks are clear and on the table, we need to carefully follow the restrictions of picking up, unstacking, putting down, and stacking the blocks.\n\n1. **Unstack the red block from on top of the orange block**: This is possible because the red block is clear and on top of the orange block.\n2. **Put down the red block**: Now that the red block is unstacked, it can be put down on the table.\n3. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block**: The blue block is also clear and can be unstacked from the yellow block.\n4. **Put down the blue block**: Once unstacked, the blue block can be placed on the table as well.\n5. **Pick up the orange block**: With my hand empty, I can now pick up the orange block.\n6. **Stack the orange block on top of the blue block**: Now that I have the orange block in my hand, I can stack it on the blue block since the blue block is clear (it has been placed down and no blocks are on it).\n7. **Pick up the yellow block**: With my hand empty again, I can pick up the yellow block.\n8. **Stack the yellow block on top of the red block**: Finally, since I hold the yellow block and the red block is on the table and clear, I can stack the yellow block on top of the red block.\n\nSince all these actions are valid and follow the rules laid out, I can conclude that the process will lead to the desired configurations.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)",

Therefore, we should first put down the yellow block to make the hand empty.\n4. The next step would be to unstack the yellow block from the orange block.\n5. After unstacking the yellow block, we can then put it down, making the orange block clear.\n6. Finally, we can confirm the current state of the blocks to ensure that the required goal is met.\n\nHence, the necessary first action is to start by putting down the yellow block.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow orange)",

The yellow block is on top of the red block, and the red block is on top of the orange block, meaning we cannot remove the red block until the yellow block is removed.\n2. Therefore, we must first unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block since the yellow block is clear and we can pick it up.\n3. After that, we put down the yellow block on the table.\n4. Next, we must unstack the red block from on top of the orange block.\n5. Once the red block is unstacked, we put down the red block directly onto the table.\n6. Then, we can unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block as we need the orange block to be clear for it to be placed on top of the yellow block.\n7. After unstacking the orange block from the blue block, we stack the orange block on top of the yellow block.\n8.

The desired goal is for the blue block to be clear, on top of the yellow block, the yellow block on top of the orange block, and the red block held in hand.\n\n1. **Current conditions**:\n   - Red block is on the orange block, so it needs to be unstacked.\n   - The yellow and blue blocks are clear, while the red block is not since it's on another block.\n\n2. **Plan steps**:\n   - **Unstack** the red block from the orange block. This makes the red block clear and allows us to free the orange block.\n   - **Put down** the red block. Now the red block is on the table and clear again.\n   - **Pick up** the yellow block.

The current scenario has the orange block atop the blue block, and the hand is empty. Therefore, the first step is to unstack the orange block from the blue block, making the blue block clear and the orange block held in hand.\n2. Once the orange block is unstacked, it can be put down, but since our goal doesn't require us to put it down, we can hold it instead.\n3. The red block is already on top of the yellow block, fulfilling part of the goal.\n4. The blue block is on the table, and only the orange block is held.\n\nTo achieve the desired configuration:\n- Start by unstacking the orange block from the blue block. \n\nSince no additional actions are required at this point, the final action can thus be identified as simply unstacking the orange block.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange blue)",

After successfully unstacking the red block, we then need to put it down to have it clear and not held.\n   - **Action**: Put down the red block.\n   \n3. Now, the orange block is clear and is on top of the yellow block. Since our goal includes having the orange block on top of the blue block, we will unstack the orange block.\n   - **Action**: Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block.\n   \n4.

This means the orange block is not clear, and we cannot accomplish our goal without first unstacking the blue block from the orange block. Since we only need to make the orange block clear and the other conditions satisfied (that red, yellow, and orange are all clear, and the red block is on the table), we can start with the move involving the blue block.\n\nThus, the first action in the plan should be to unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block.

Therefore, we must first unstack the blue block from the red block.\n   - Once the blue block is unstacked and put down, we can unstack the red block from the yellow block. \n   - After that, we will stack the red block on the yellow block, making the red block clear.\n\n**Final Plan**:\n1. Unstack the blue block from on top of the red block (this makes the blue block clear).\n2. Put down the blue block on the table (this clears the blue block).\n3. Unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block (this makes the red block clear).\n4. Stack the red block on top of the blue block (this meets one of our goal states).\n\nWith this planned sequence, we can achieve the desired end configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)",

The initial condition has the yellow block on top of the red block, which prevents the red block from being clear. Therefore, the first step must be to unstack the yellow block from the red block.\n2. Once the yellow block is unstacked, we can put the yellow block down on the table. This step will allow us to keep our hands empty.\n3. Next, we need to unstack the red block from the blue block. The red block cannot be clear yet because it was stacked on the yellow block.\n4. After putting down the red block, both the red and blue blocks can now be unstacked. We can unstack the blue block from the orange block, allowing it to be clear.\n5. Finally, we put down the blue block as well.\n\nNext, we can pick up the yellow block and stack it back down, ensuring that it is clear as well.

        "answer": "To reach the goal where the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, my hand is currently holding the red block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, and the orange block is on the table, we can break down the steps:\n\n1. Since I currently have the red block in my hand, I cannot perform actions that require my hand to be empty (like unstacking or putting down anything else).\n2. The current state shows that the red block is on top of the blue block. To begin, I need to unstack the red block from the blue block, which allows the blue block to become clear.\n3. After unstacking the red block, I can then put it down in a clear state.\n4. Now I will ensure that the blue block needs to stay on top of the orange block. By unstacking the blue block from the orange block, I can also put down the blue block afterward, since the orange block is clear on the table.\n5. Next, I can pick up the red block (which I need to keep).\n6. Then, I need to stack the red block on the yellow block. It leaves the blue block clear and allows me to satisfy the arrangement for the goal.\n\nFollowing through these thoughts, the sequence to perform the actions can be stated clearly as:\n\n1. Unstack the red block from on top of the blue block (this makes the blue block clear).\n2. Put down the red block (now my hand is empty).\n3. Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block (leaving the orange block on the table).\n4. Put down the blue block.\n5. Pick up the yellow block.\n6. Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block (now the blue block is no longer clear).\n7. Pick up the red block.\n8.

The yellow block is on top of the red block, hence the red block is not clear. To accomplish this, we first need to unstack the yellow block from the red block.\n2. After unstacking the yellow block, we can stack it on top of the orange block, making sure the yellow block is now clear.\n3. Now, we need to pick up the blue block while our hand is empty and the blue block is clear.\n4.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, and the hand is empty, we need to carefully analyze the current conditions and the actions allowed. \n\nStarting conditions are:\n- The blue block is on top of the yellow block.\n- The red block, orange block, and yellow block are all clear and on the table.\n- My hand is empty.\n\nWe need to unstack the blue block from the yellow block to start since the blue block can't be moved otherwise.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the orange block clear, the yellow block clear, and the specified stacking of blocks, we need to follow the rules strictly. \n\n1. The orange block is currently on top of the blue block and must first be unstacked. This requires the hand to be empty, which it is. We can unstack the orange block.\n2. After unstacking the orange block, it must be put down so my hand becomes empty.\n3. The next step is to unstack the red block from the yellow block. The red block is currently on top of the yellow block, which is clear. Thus, it can be unstacked.\n4. Once the red block is unstacked, it needs to be stacked on the blue block. The blue block is clear, fulfilling the condition for stacking.\n5. Next, I need to pick up the yellow block. The yellow block is now the only block left on the table, so it can be picked up.\n6.

The red block is clear.\n2. The yellow block is clear.\n3. The hand is currently holding the orange block.\n4. The yellow block is on top of the blue block.\n5. The red block is on the table.\n6. The blue block is on the table.\n\n### Steps to Achieve Goals:\n1. **Unstack Blue from Yellow**: Since the blue block is on top of the yellow block and is clear, we can unstack the blue block from the yellow block. After this action, the yellow block will become clear, and we will hold the blue block.\n   \n2. **Put Down Blue**: With the blue block held in hand, we can put it down on the table. After this action, the blue block will be on the table, and the hand will be empty.\n\n3. **Unstack Yellow from Orange**: The yellow block is currently on top of the orange block and is clear since we put down the blue block. Therefore, we can unstack the yellow block from the orange block.\n\n4. **Stack Yellow on Blue**: Now, we will stack the yellow block on top of the blue block. After this step, the yellow block will no longer be clear, but it will be correctly positioned on top of the blue block.\n\n5. **Unstack Orange from Red**: The orange block is on top of the red block, and since the red block is clear, we can unstack the orange block from the red block and hold it in hand.\n\n6. **Stack Orange on Yellow**: Finally, we can stack the orange block on top of the yellow block.

Therefore, to make the yellow block clear, we need to unstack the blue block first.\n   - The orange block is on top of the red block; it is also clear, but our goal is to change the stacking of the blocks.\n   - The hand is empty, which allows us to pick up or unstack any blocks that are clear.\n  \n2. **Plan Steps:**\n   - First, unstack the blue block from the yellow block. This will allow the yellow block to be clear since there will be no block on top of it.\n   - Next, put down the blue block on the table, making it available for further operations without any restrictions.\n   - Then, pick up the yellow block, since it is now clear after unstacking.\n   - After picking up the yellow block, stack it on top of the blue block. Now the yellow block is on the blue block, which fulfills part of our goal.\n   - Finally, unstack the orange block from the red block and stack it back on the red block to ensure it remains clear and in its desired position.\n\nWe can summarize that the operations will be conducted in succession as follows: \n\nSteps: \n1. unstack blue from yellow \n2. put down blue \n3. pick up yellow \n4. stack yellow on blue \n\nAfter completing these operations, the orange block will still be on top of the red block, which also satisfies the goal of the model.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal, we first need to clarify the initial conditions and the desired outcome. The initial state has the red block on top of the yellow block, which creates a blocking situation for our goal to achieve clear states for each block and a specific stack order.\n\nHere\u2019s how we can interpret the moves:\n\n1. **Unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block**: This action is valid because the red block is on top of the yellow block and is clear. This step will be the first action.\n   \n2. **Put down the red block**: After unstacking the red block, we can place it down on the table since our hand is empty.\n\n3. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block**: This action may seem valid at first, but upon closer inspection, the yellow block is not on top of the blue block; rather, the yellow block is on top of the blue block, making this action impossible. Therefore, this action cannot be performed.\n\nThus, we can conclude that the provided plan is invalid as there is no path that corresponds to achieving the outcomes stated without breaking any underlying rules.\n\nNow, the next actionable steps based on the correct interpretation could involve first clearing the blocks one by one and then reorganizing them according to the goal.\n\nRevisiting the actions and the clearances:\n\n1.

After unstacking the blue block, I will put it down on the table to make it clear.\n3. Next, I need to unstack the orange block from the yellow block, which is possible because the orange block is on top and the yellow block will become clear after the orange block is unstacked.\n4. After unstacking the orange block, I need to put it down on the table.\n5. Then, I will unstack the yellow block from the red block. Since the yellow block is on the red block and is not clear, I can put it down after unstacking, making it available to be clear and on the table.\n6. After putting the yellow block down, I will have all three blocks independently clear and placed on the table.\n7.

The orange block is currently not clear because the red block is on top of it, so we can successfully unstack the orange block after putting down the red block. The orange block becomes clear as it is now independent and on top of the blue block which is also clear.\n- Next, we will stack the orange block on the yellow block.

We need to make both the orange and yellow blocks available to be put down, as they are currently stacked.\n2. To put them down, we first have to unstack one of them.\n3. The red block is currently not clear because the yellow block is on top of it. To achieve our final goal, we will need to have the red block held in our hands at some point, which requires us to first make the yellow block clear.\n\nGiven the constraints, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block**: Since the orange block is clear and can be unstacked, this action will make the yellow block now available.\n2. **Put down the orange block**: After unstacking, we can safely put the orange block down.\n3. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block**: Now that the hand is empty and the yellow block is clear, we can unstack it.\n4. **Put down the yellow block**: After unstacking, we put the yellow block down.\n5. **Pick up the red block**: The red block is now clear (not covered by any other block), so we can pick it up.\n\nFollowing these actions will lead us toward the objective of having the red block held in our hand, while the other blocks remain on the table.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack yellow red)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up red)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the blue block, the orange block on the table, the yellow block on top of the red block, and all blocks clear, I will analyze each step of the plan.\n\n1. The initial conditions state that the red block is clear and on the table, the blue block is clear and on the table, the orange block is clear and on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is on the table. Since the hand is empty, I can pick up the red block.\n   \n   Action: pick up the red block \u2192 Now the hand is holding the red block.\n\n2. Next, I will stack the red block on top of the blue block. The blue block is clear, so this action is valid.\n   \n   Action: stack red block on blue block \u2192 The red block is now on the blue block, and the blue block is no longer clear.\n\n3. Now, I need to unstack the orange block from the yellow block. The orange block is clear and on top of the yellow block, making this action permissible.\n   \n   Action: unstack orange block from yellow block \u2192 The orange block is picked up, and the yellow block is now clear.\n\n4. I will put down the orange block on the table, which is allowed since I am holding the orange block.\n   \n   Action: put down orange block \u2192 The orange block is now on the table, and my hand is empty.\n\n5. Next, I will need to pick up the yellow block, which is now clear.\n   \n   Action: pick up the yellow block \u2192 Now I am holding the yellow block.\n\n6. Then, I will stack the yellow block on top of the red block. The red block (which is on the blue block) is not clear, so this action cannot be executed yet. Therefore, I have to adjust my plan.\n\n7. After confirming that the orange block is on the table and clear, I will modify my actions: I can complete the stacking after confirming the right positions again as per the goal.\n\nThus, my actions conclude as follows: after picking up the red block, stacking it onto the blue block, unstacking the orange block from the yellow block, and putting down the orange block, I\u2019ll keep the next steps flexible to stack the yellow block appropriately.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the red block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is holding the yellow block, the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on the table, and the orange block is on the table, we need to go through the following steps:\n\n1. Since the blue block is currently on top of the red block and we cannot stack or unstack without first addressing this situation, we must begin by unstacking the blue block from the red block because the blue block is currently not clear (as it is under the blue block).\n   \n2. After unstacking, we put down the blue block. At this point, the blue block is now on the table and the hand is empty.\n\n3. We then unstack the red block from the yellow block, which is clear since the yellow block has been previously stacked on the orange block.\n\n4. After unstacking the red block, we can now stack it on the blue block, fulfilling the condition that the red block is on top of the blue block.\n\n5. Next, we unstack the yellow block from the orange block, which is also clear at this point.\n\n6. Once the yellow block is unstacked, we put it down; now it is on the table, hand empty again.\n\n7. Finally, we pick up the orange block and stack it on the yellow block. Now both the orange and yellow blocks are clear on the table.\n\nNow the final situation aligns with the success criteria of the goal stated, thus:\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(stack red blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)",

        "answer": "Given the initial conditions, the red block is clear and on the table, the orange block is clear and on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is clear and on top of the blue block. The goal is to ensure that the red block remains clear, the yellow block remains clear, the hand is currently holding the orange block, and the yellow block sits on the blue block.\n\nTo achieve the goal, the first necessary action is to unstack the orange block from the yellow block since the orange block is currently on top of the yellow block and must be picked up before any further actions. The action of unstacking the orange block is valid because the orange block is clear, and it is indeed on top of the yellow block. Once unstacked, the plan will proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block.** This action makes the orange block held in my hand and the yellow block remains clear on the blue block.\n2. **Put down the orange block.** This action will make my hand empty, and the orange block will be placed on the table.\n3. **Pick up the red block.** Since the red block is clear and on the table, this action is valid.\n4. **Stack the red block on top of the yellow block.** The yellow block is clear after the orange block has been put down, so the stacking is valid.\n5. **Pick up the orange block.** With the orange block on the table, it can now be picked up again.\n6. **Stack the orange block on top of the red block.** After stacking, the red block is no longer clear, which is allowed as per the goal conditions.\n\nThrough these actions, the objective is achieved in accordance with the restrictions provided in the initial problem.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange yellow)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where all specified blocks are either stacked or resting on the table correctly, I'll first evaluate the initial conditions and reflect on the sequence of moves proposed.\n\n1. The orange block is already clear and can be picked up.\n2. The hand is empty, allowing for the first action of unstacking the orange block from the yellow block.\n3. After successfully unstacking the orange block, I can put it down anywhere that it is clear, which in this case is the table.\n4. Next, I unstack the yellow block from the blue block\u2014this is valid since the yellow block is clear (it has nothing on top of it).\n5. Upon stacking the yellow block on top of the orange block, this makes the orange block no longer clear.\n6. Now I can unstack the blue block from the red block, as the blue block is clear.\n7. After putting the blue block down, the blue block will then be on the table and clear.\n8. I need to unstack the yellow block from the orange block (which is now not clear) so this step would require re-evaluation.\n9. Finally, I can stack the yellow block on the blue block, which is already clear after the previous steps.\n\nHowever, through the process, I realize I cannot unstack the yellow block from the orange block because the orange block is currently obstructed by the yellow block. \n\nConsidering these steps, here's the correct sequence to achieve the goal based on the inference from the constraints:\n\n1. Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block (which cannot be done directly since orange is on top of yellow).\n2. Put down the orange block (this can't be done until the first step is viable).\n3. Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block (need the yellow to be clear first).\n4. Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block (not possible if orange is on yellow).\n5. Unstack the blue block from the red block (this can be done already).\n6. Put down the blue block (this is the next logical step).\n7. Unstack the yellow block from the orange block (but orange is now covered).\n8. Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n\nThus, correcting the approach to sequence the unstacking and stacking actions based on initial positions and clarity of blocks will lead to the final plan that ultimately fulfills the conditions.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow blue)",

We start with the red block on top of the orange block and the blue block on top of the yellow block. The red block is not clear because the orange block is below it.\n2. To make the orange block clear, we need to unstack the red block from on top of the orange block, which will allow the orange block to be on the table and clear afterward.\n3.

Starting conditions:\n   - The blue block is clear and currently on the orange block.\n   - The yellow block is clear and currently on the red block.\n   - The red block is on the table, and the orange block is also on the table. \n\n2. Inferences:\n   - I need to move the blue block to a position where it is on the table, so it must be unstacked first. The first action will be to unstack the blue block from the orange block (this makes the orange clear).\n   - After unstacking, I will put down the blue block on the table, making sure it stays clear.\n   - Next, I will unstack the yellow block from the red block, so I have the yellow block in my hand and the red block remains on the table (this will make the red block clear).\n   - Then, I will stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.

This action will leave the red block held in our hand while the yellow block will remain clear.\n\n2. **Put down the red block:** Since our hand now holds the red block, we can put it down onto the table. After this action, the red block will be on the table and clear.\n\n3. **Pick up the orange block:** The orange block is currently clear and on the table, so we can pick it up. Our hand now holds the orange block.\n\n4. **Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block:** The yellow block is clear, and we are holding the orange block, so we can stack the orange block on top of the yellow block.

The hand is empty.\n\nThe actions in the plan can be checked step by step:\n\n1. **Unstack** the orange block from on top of the yellow block: \n\n   This action is not valid because the orange block is not clear - it\u2019s on top of the yellow block.\n\nSince the first action is invalid, the whole plan can't be executed successfully as it stands.

This step is valid, revealing the red block underneath.\n2. **Put down the blue block** on the table. Now the blue block is on the table, but the red block remains on the table below.\n3. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block**. This action cannot be performed because the blue block is now clear and on the table; the yellow block cannot be \"unstacked\" from it since it was previously on top of the blue block.\n4. **Put down the yellow block**. This step is also invalid because the yellow block is still on the blue block (which has not been unstacked yet).\n\nSince iterations through the plan show that it cannot be executed due to these invalid actions based on the initial conditions, we need to revise the strategy concluded from the inferences.\n\nUltimately, recognizing that the goal requires more than stacks,\n1.

        "answer": "To reach the goal state, we need to carry out actions that adhere to the rules while ensuring that the conditions for each action are met. The initial conditions tell us that the blue block is currently on top of the yellow block, making the yellow block not clear. The strategy involves getting the blue block off the yellow block first to make the yellow block clear.\n\n1. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block**: This is the first action. The blue block is currently on the yellow block, and since we are starting with an empty hand, we can unstack the blue block.\n\n2. **Put down the blue block**: After unstacking the blue block, we need to put it down to an empty space. As we are holding the blue block, this action will make our hand empty again.\n\n3. At this point, the blue block is on the table, and the yellow block is clear (as the blue block has been removed). However, we need the yellow block to be on top of the red block for the goal state.\n\nTherefore, since our actions so far do not contradict the initial conditions and allow us to get to a state where we can manipulate the blocks further, the formulated steps lead us to our intended outcome.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)",

After this, the red block will be clear and will be sitting on the table.\n\n3. **Unstack Blue Block from Orange Block**:\n   - Now, we can unstack the blue block from the orange block because the blue block is currently on top of the orange block and is clear. \n\n4. **Stack Blue Block on Red Block**: \n   - With the blue block in hand, we can stack it on the red block, which is now clear and on the table, which fulfills our first part of the goal.\n\n5. **Pick Up Orange Block**: \n   - Next, we will pick up the orange block, which is clear on the table.\n\n6. **Stack Orange Block on Blue Block**: \n   - We will stack the orange block on top of the blue block. Since the blue block is now in the middle of the stack, it is no longer clear.\n\n7. **Pick Up Yellow Block**: \n   - Finally, we can pick up the yellow block from the table (which is clear) and stack it on top of the orange block.\n\nAfter executing all these steps, we need to re-check if all blocks and hand conditions are satisfied based on the given rules.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)",

First, I can unstack the red block from the blue block since it is currently stacked on top. This is permitted as the red block is clear, and I have an empty hand.\n2. After unstacking, I need to put down the red block onto the table, which is allowed because I am holding the red block.\n3. Next, I can unstack the blue block from the yellow block, as the blue block is currently stacked upon the yellow block, and the blue block is clear (now that the red block is on the table).\n4. I will put down the blue block on the table as I am holding it.\n5. Following this, I can unstack the yellow block from the orange block since the yellow block is currently on top of the orange block and is clear.\n6.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal stated, let\u2019s analyze the current situation and the plan outlined.\n\n1. **Initial conditions:** \n   - The red block is clear.\n   - The yellow block is clear.\n   - The hand is empty.\n   - The blue block is on top of the orange block.\n   - The yellow block is on top of the blue block.\n   - The red block is on the table.\n   - The orange block is on the table.\n  \n2. **Goal:**\n   - The orange block is clear.\n   - The yellow block is clear.\n   - The hand is currently holding the blue block.\n   - The orange block is on top of the red block.\n   - The red block is on the table.\n   - The yellow block is on the table.\n\n3. **Action Analysis:**\n   - **Step 1:** Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block: This is valid because the yellow block is clear and on top of the blue block.\n   - **Step 2:** Put down the yellow block: The hand is empty, so I can put down the yellow block.\n   - **Step 3:** Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block: This is valid because the blue block is on top of the orange block.\n   - **Step 4:** Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block: The blue block is now free and the yellow block is clear, so this action is valid.\n   - **Step 5:** Pick up the orange block: The orange block is clear since the blue block was previously unstacked from it.\n   - **Step 6:** Stack the orange block on top of the red block: The orange block is held and the red block is clear, making this action valid.\n   - **Step 7:** Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block: This is valid as the blue block was just stacked on the yellow block.\n\n4. The sequence of actions takes us from the initial conditions to aligning with the goals specified, ensuring that the yellow block remains clear throughout the process. \n\nThus, the sequence of actions leads to the final required condition.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow blue)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)\n(unstack blue yellow)",
