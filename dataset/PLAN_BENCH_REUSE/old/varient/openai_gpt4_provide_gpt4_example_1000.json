The steps to achieve this are as follows:\n\n1. **Unstack the blue block from the yellow block**:\n   - Since the blue block is clear and on top of the yellow block, we can unstack it. This action will make the blue block clear.\n   \n2. **Stack the blue block on top of the red block**:\n   - With the hand now holding the blue block from the previous step, stack it on top of the clear red block. This will complete one part of the goal (blue on red).\n   \n3. **Unstack the yellow block from the orange block**:\n   - Next, unstack the yellow block from the clear orange block. This action clears the yellow block and leaves the orange block open for further manipulation.\n\n4. **Put down the yellow block**:\n   - After unstacking the yellow block, put it down on the table. This step will make the yellow block clear and meet the goal condition of it being on the table.\n\n5. **Pick up the orange block**:\n   - Finally, pick up the clear orange block.

Yellow block is on the table.\n\n### Reasoning to Achieve Goal:\n1. The initial step requires that the blue block be stacked onto the orange block to meet the goal condition where the blue block is on top of the orange block.\n   - Since the blue block is clear and on the table, and the hand is empty, we can pick up the blue block.\n   - After picking up the blue block, stack it on top of the orange block.\n\n2. After stacking:\n   - The blue block is on top of the orange block, and the orange is on top of the red block (as initially stated).\n   - The hand becomes empty once the block is stacked.\n   - Both the blue block and the orange block fulfill their positions relative to each other, as described in the goal conditions.\n\n3. **Final Check**:\n   - Verify that all other goal conditions are satisfied:\n     - Blue block is now on top of the orange block.\n     - Hand is empty after stacking.\n     - Yellow block remains clear and on the table, satisfying its condition.\n     - Blue block, although now on top of the orange block, is still clear under goal conditions.\n\nHere's how each action correlates with restrictions and conditions:\n- **Pick up the blue block** since the blue block is clear and on the table, and the hand is initially empty.\n- **Stack the blue block on the orange block** because the orange block is initially clear.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe sequence of actions needed to satisfy the goal conditions is complete with these two steps.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)",

So the first action is to unstack the blue block.\n   - This will make the hand hold the blue block and the orange block will become clear.\n\n2. **Stack the blue block on top of the red block**:\n    - Once the blue block is held, stack it on top of the red block, which ensures the blue block is on top of the red block as required by the goal.\n    - After this step, the blue block is no longer held, and it becomes the topmost block on the red block, making the blue block and red block both no longer clear.\n\n### Checking Conditions:\n- At this point, the table conditions meet the goal state since the blue block is on the red block, and both the orange and yellow blocks remain clear on the table. The hand is empty, completing the requirement of the stated goal.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue red)",

Unstack to hold it.\n\n2. **Put down the blue block**:\n   - Hand is holding the blue block. Put it down to free the hand for other actions.\n\n3. **Unstack the orange block from the yellow block**:\n   - Since the orange block is on top of the yellow block and clear, unstack it to hold it.\n\n4. **Put down the orange block**:\n   - Release the orange block by placing it on the table.\n\n5. **Pick up the yellow block**:\n   - The yellow block is now clear (no block on top, and it's on the table), making it eligible to be picked up.\n\n6. **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block**:\n   - Hold the yellow block and stack it on the now clear orange block, aligning closer to the goal state.\n\n7. **Pick up the red block**:\n   - With the hand empty and the red block being clear, pick it up to start forming the desired stack configuration.\n\n8. **Stack the red block on top of the yellow block**:\n   - Place the red block on the yellow block, aligning with the goal condition.\n\n9. **Pick up the blue block**:\n   - The blue block is clear and able to be picked up. Pick it up to finalize holding it.\n\n#### Verification after Steps:\n- The **red block** is clear because nothing is stacked on top of it after stacking it last on top of the yellow block.\n- The **hand** is currently holding the **blue block** after the final step.\n- The **red block** is on top of the yellow block following the action sequence outlined.\n- The **yellow block** is on top of the orange block as planned.\n- The **orange block** remains on the table as required by the goal.\n\n**Plan Achieves All Goal Conditions.**\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red yellow)\n(pick-up blue)",

The only movement necessary is to move the yellow block directly to the table, as the other conditions are already met by the initial setup, apart from the yellow one.\n\n1. **Unstack the yellow block**:\n   - Since the yellow block is on top of the red block and is clear, the hand being empty allows us to unstack the yellow block. \n   - This action will lead to the yellow block being held in the hand, and the red block beneath becoming clear after unstacking.\n   \n2. **Put down the yellow block**:\n   - After holding the yellow block, the action allows us to put it directly on the table, which will complete the task of having the yellow block on the table and the hand empty again.\n\n### Result:\nAfter these actions, the conditions of the goal are fully satisfied without disturbing the existing required stacks of red on the blue and blue on the orange, and the table positions of the orange.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow red)\n(put-down yellow)",

        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE\n\nTo solve the given problem and reach the desired goal, we begin by evaluating the initial conditions and the required steps to transition into the goal state. Here is the systematic breakdown:\n\n**Initial Conditions:**\n- The blue block is clear and on top of the orange block.\n- The orange block is on top of the red block.\n- The red block is on the table.\n- The yellow block is clear and on the table.\n- The hand is empty.\n\n**Goal Conditions:**\n- The orange block is clear.\n- The yellow block is clear.\n- The hand is empty.\n- The red block is on top of the blue block.\n- The orange block is on top of the red block.\n- The blue block and yellow block are on the table.\n\n### Inference Steps:\n\n1. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block**:\n   - Since the blue block is clear and on top of the orange block, the first action is to unstack it, allowing it to be placed directly on the table.\n\n2. **Put down the blue block**:\n   - After unstacking, the blue block is put down on the table, thus freeing the hand and making the blue block stable.\n\n3. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the red block**:\n   - Next, unstack the orange block from the red block because it is a clear block, making the red block available for the next operations.\n\n4. **Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block**:\n   - Temporarily move the orange block to sit on top of the yellow block to keep it organized while managing the essential red and blue blocks in the desired configuration.\n\n5. **Pick up the red block**:\n   - With the hand free, pick up the red block to begin properly stacking the blocks in the correct order.\n\n6. **Stack the red block on top of the blue block**:\n   - Place the red block onto the previously placed blue block on the table to satisfy the eventual goal of having the red block on top of the blue.\n\n7. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block**:\n   - Retrieve the orange block from the top of the yellow block, as the next goal is to move it on top of the red block.\n\n8. **Stack the orange block on top of the red block**:\n   - Place the orange block on the red block, following the goal structure.\n\nFinally, ensure that all blocks end on the table for clarity and space management as needed for the final stacking. \n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack orange red)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(stack orange red)",

        "answer": "To achieve the desired goal where the red block, blue block, and yellow block are clear, the hand is holding the orange block, and the red block, blue block, and yellow block are on the table, we can break down the actions as follows:\n\n**Initial Conditions Recap:**\n1. Red block is clear.\n2. Hand is empty.\n3. Red block is on top of the yellow block.\n4. Blue block is on top of the orange block.\n5. Yellow block is on top of the blue block.\n6. Orange block is on the table.\n\n**Goal Conditions Recap:**\n1. Red block is clear.\n2. Blue block is clear.\n3. Yellow block is clear.\n4. Hand is holding the orange block.\n5. Red block is on the table.\n6. Blue block is on the table.\n7. Yellow block is on the table.\n\n### Reasoning and Actions Needed:\n\n1. **Unstack the red block from the yellow block:**\n   - Since the red block is clear and the initial condition allows for unstacking, unstack the red block from the yellow block.\n   - This action holds the red block and clears the yellow block.\n\n2. **Put down the red block:**\n   - This places the red block on the table and frees up the hand.\n\n3. **Unstack the yellow block from the blue block:**\n   - Now, with the red block on the table and the hand empty, unstack the yellow block from the blue block.\n   - This clears the blue block.\n\n4. **Put down the yellow block:**\n   - This places the yellow block on the table and frees up the hand.\n\n5. **Unstack the blue block from the orange block:**\n   - Now, with the hand empty and the blue block clear, unstack the blue block from the orange block.\n\n6. **Put down the blue block:**\n   - This places the blue block on the table and frees up the hand.\n\n7. **Pick up the orange block:**\n   - Finally, since the hand is empty and the orange block is clear, pick up the orange block.\n\n**After these actions:**\n- The red, blue, and yellow blocks are all on the table and clear.\n- The hand is holding the orange block.\n\nThe sequence of actions ensures all goal conditions are satisfied.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up orange)",

Yellow block is on the table.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1. **Yellow block** is currently on top of the orange block. To clear the orange block and to have the yellow block on the table:\n   - Unstack the yellow block from the orange block. This action makes the yellow block in hand and the orange block clear.\n   - Put down the yellow block. This places the yellow block on the table, making it also clear, and the hand becomes empty.\n\n2. After these actions, the conditions are as follows:\n   - **Red block** remains clear (as it was untouched).\n   - **Blue block** remains clear (as it was untouched).\n   - **Orange block** is clear after unstacking the yellow block.\n   - **Yellow block** is clear and on the table after being put down.\n   - **Hand** is empty after placing the yellow block down.\n   - **Red block**, **blue block**, **orange block**, and **yellow block** are on the table.\n\nThese steps ensure the goal conditions are met.\n\n### Final Answer:\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)",

Yellow block is on the table.\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. **Red block** is currently on top of the blue block. To move it onto the yellow block while achieving the goal:\n   - Unstack the red block from the blue block. This action is feasible because the hand is empty and the red block is clear.\n   - After unstacking, the red block is in the hand and the blue block becomes clear.\n\n2. **Stack the red block on top of the yellow block**:\n   - Stack action is possible as the yellow block is clear. After stacking, release the red block onto the yellow block and the hand becomes empty.\n\nAfter the above steps:\n- The red block is on the yellow block.\n- The blue block remains on the table and is clear.\n- The orange block remains on the table and is clear.\n- The yellow block is no longer clear, but this does not contradict any goal condition.\n- The hand is empty.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red blue)\n(stack red yellow)",

Therefore, the action \"pick up the red block\" is valid and will successfully transition the state to one where the hand is holding the red block.\n- This action will not affect the blue and yellow blocks, leaving them clear as required by the goal.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up red)",

Yellow block is on top of the blue block.\n5. Red block is on the table.\n6. Blue block is on the table.\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. To achieve the goal where the hand is holding the orange block, we should first ensure that the orange block is removed from wherever it is currently. Since the orange block is on top of the yellow block:\n   - **Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block.**\n   - Once unstacked, the hand will be holding the orange block, satisfying part of the goal.\n\nAfter unstacking the orange block:\n- The orange block is in the hand.\n- The yellow block, which was beneath the orange block, is now clear.\n- The red block and blue block are undisturbed and remain on the table, maintaining their clear status.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- The red block remains clear and on the table.\n- The yellow block becomes clear after the orange block is unstacked.\n- The hand is holding the orange block.\n- The yellow block is still on top of the blue block.\n- The blue block remains on the table.\n\nThus, the plan to achieve the goal as per the requirements is to unstack the orange block first.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange yellow)",

Hand is holding the yellow block.\n3. Red block is on top of the orange block.\n4. Blue block is on top of the red block.\n5. Orange block is on the table.\n\n**Plan Execution:**\n\n1. **Unstack** the red block from on top of the yellow block:\n   - This makes the red block held in the hand and the yellow block clear.\n\n2. **Stack** the red block on top of the orange block:\n   - Now, release the red block on the orange block, making the hand empty.\n\n3. **Unstack** the yellow block from on top of the blue block:\n   - Hold the yellow block in the hand, making the blue block clear.\n\n4. **Put down** the yellow block on the table:\n   - This will make the hand empty and leave the yellow block accessible.\n\n5. **Pick up** the blue block:\n   - Hold the blue block in the hand, which is a necessary intermediate step before stacking it.\n\n6. **Stack** the blue block on top of the red block:\n   - The block is now in the desired position according to the goal statement. The blue block is no longer clear as it is placed on top of the red block. The hand is now empty.\n\n7. **Pick up** the yellow block:\n   - Hold the yellow block in the hand. Now, this state is achieved, where the hand is holding the yellow block.\n\n8. **Verify the Goal Completion**:\n   - The blue block is clear as per initial condition and needs to be stacked within the planned final moves.\n   - The hand is holding the yellow block.\n   - The red block is on top of the orange block.\n   - The blue block has been stacked on top of the red block.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nFollowing the described steps achieves the intended state where the blue block is clear, the hand is holding the yellow block, and the red and blue blocks are in their specified positions relative to the orange block.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n(unstack red yellow)\n(stack red orange)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue red)\n(pick-up yellow)",

The orange block is on the table.\n\n### Plan to Achieve Goal:\n1. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the red block**:\n   - The orange block is currently on top of the red block, and it is clear, so the first action is to unstack the orange block from the red block.\n   - After unstacking, you will be holding the orange block, and the red block becomes clear.\n\n2. **Put down the orange block**:\n   - Now, put the orange block down on the table.\n   - After putting down the orange block, your hand becomes empty, and the orange block is clear on the table.\n\nAt this point after these actions, the goal conditions are satisfied:\n- The red block is clear as no block is on top of it.\n- The orange block is clear and on the table.\n- The hand is empty.\n- The remainder of the goal conditions (red block on yellow block, yellow block on blue block, blue block on table) are unchanged.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange red)\n(put-down orange)",

Since the hand is empty and the yellow block is clear, we unstack the yellow block from the blue block.\n\n2. **Put down the yellow block:**\n   - Place the yellow block on the table, making the hand empty and yellow on the table.\n\n3. **Unstack the red block from the orange block:**\n   - The red block is on top of the orange block and clear. The hand is empty, so unstack the red from the orange block.\n\n4. **Stack the red block on top of the yellow block:**\n   - The yellow block is on the table and clear. Stack the red block on the yellow block. The hand is now empty.\n\n5. **Pick up the blue block:**\n   - The blue block is clear and on the table. Pick up the blue block with the empty hand.\n\n6. **Stack the blue block on top of the orange block:**\n   - Stack the blue block on the orange block, achieving the condition for the blue block.\n\nAfter these steps, ensure each block's status matches the final goal:\n- The red block on top of the yellow block makes the red block clear.\n- The blue block on top of the orange block makes the blue block clear.\n- Hand is empty as there is no action needed after putting down the blocks in place.\n\nHence, using the logical steps outlined, the blocks should now match the goal configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack yellow blue)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack red orange)\n(stack red yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)",

Hand is holding the orange block.\n3. Blue block is on top of the yellow block.\n4. Yellow block is on top of the red block.\n5. Red block is on the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n1. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block:** \n   - The orange block is clear, so we can unstack it. Now holding the orange block.\n2. **Put down the orange block:** \n   - Since the orange block is now held, we put it down. Hand becomes empty.\n3. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block:** \n   - The yellow block is clear, so we unstack it. Now holding the yellow block.\n4. **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block:** \n   - Since the orange block is clear after being put down, we stack the yellow block on it. Hand becomes empty.\n5. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the red block:** \n   - The blue block is clear, so we unstack it. Now holding the blue block.\n6. **Put down the blue block:** \n   - We put down the blue block on the table.

Now holding the yellow block.\n8. **Stack the yellow block on top of the red block:** \n   - The red block is clear, so we stack the yellow block on it, achieving part of our goal. Hand becomes empty.\n9. **Pick up the blue block:** \n   - The blue block is clear and on the table, so we can pick it up. Now holding the blue block.\n10. **Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block:** \n   - The yellow block is clear, so we stack the blue block on it. Hand becomes empty, achieving more of our goal.\n11. **Pick up the orange block:** \n   - The orange block is again clear on the table, so we pick it up, requiring this for the final goal state.\n\n### Verification:\n- **Blue block is clear** after step 10 as no block is on top of it.\n- **Hand is holding the orange block** after step 11.\n- **Blue block is on top of the yellow block** after step 10.\n- **Yellow block is on top of the red block** after step 8.\n- The **red block is on the table** throughout and remains so.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up orange)",

Since the goal is to hold the blue block while the red block stays on top of the yellow block (unchanged), with the hand being empty and blue clear:\n   - Unstack the blue block from on top of the red block because the blue block is clear and the hand is empty, allowing the unstack action.\n3. Once the blue block is unstacked, it's being held, which satisfies the goal condition where the hand holds the blue block.\n4. With the blue block removed from the top of the red block, the red block remains on the yellow block (satisfying the goal of it being unchanged).\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The red block remains unchanged on the yellow block.\n- The yellow block remains on the orange block.\n- The blue block is held by the hand.\n- The blue block is removed from the top of the red block, leaving the red block clear.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue red)",

Begin by unstacking the blue block from on top of the red block, as the blue block is clear and this action leaves the red block (on top of the orange block) and blue block separate, freeing the hand to perform further actions.\n\n2. Put down the blue block on the table. This makes the blue block clear and completes the desired condition where the blue block is on the table. At this point, the blue block and the red block are in separate and correct positions for the goal state.\n\nFinal Check:\n- The red block is on top of the orange block, both are in their desired configuration.\n- The blue block is on the table, satisfying its requirement.\n- The orange block remains on the table, which is the goal state.\n- Both the red, blue, and yellow blocks are clear.\n- The hand becomes empty after putting down the blue block.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)",

This makes the red block clear and the blue block clear while you are holding the red block.\n   \n2. **Put down the red block onto the table:**\n   - After unstacking the red block, put it down on the table to free up your hand.\n\n3. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block:**\n   - The orange block is clear, so it can be unstacked from the yellow block, which makes the yellow block clear.\n\n4. **Stack the orange block on top of the blue block:**\n   - With the orange block in hand and the blue block now clear, stack the orange block on top of the blue block to satisfy part of the goal.\n\n5. **Pick up the yellow block:**\n   - Now, with your hand empty, pick up the yellow block from the table. This results in your hand holding the yellow block, thus reaching the goal state.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- The red block is clear and on the table.\n- The orange block is on top of the blue block, and the blue block is on the table.\n- The hand is currently holding the yellow block, meeting all the requirements of the goal state.\n\n### Final Answer:\n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up yellow)",

The yellow block is on the table.\n\n### Reasoning and Inference:\n1. **Unstack the yellow block from the red block**:\n   - Because the yellow block is on top of the red block and clear, the yellow block can be unstacked first.\n   - After this step, the yellow block is in hand but clear to be put on the table next.\n  \n2. **Put down the yellow block**:\n   - Put the yellow block on the table.\n   - This clears the yellow block and frees up the hand, as the hand must be empty to proceed with the next action in the plan.\n  \n3. **Unstack the red block from the blue block**:\n   - Now, unstack the red block from the blue block.\n   - After this, the red block will be in the hand, and the blue block will be clear and remain on the table, meeting part of the goal conditions.\n\n### Summary:\n- Unstacking the yellow block makes the red block clear.\n- Putting down the yellow block clears the yellow block as required.\n- Unstacking the red block from the blue block achieves the state where the hand is holding the red block, and the blue block, orange block, and yellow block are all clear.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nFollowing these inferred steps satisfies all the conditions of the goal state. The plan is logical based on the initial conditions and restrictions provided.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack yellow red)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack red blue)",

Since the blue block is clear, stack the red block on top of the blue block. This satisfies the condition that the red block is on top of the blue block.\n\nAfter these actions:\n- The red block is no longer clear since the orange block will be placed on top of it if we follow the first plan. However, in this scenario, the simplified required conditions in the goal suggest leaving the blocks as per the first two steps alone ensures all blocks except the red and blue meet the clear requirement without following the subsequent plan steps since the possibilities or equivalence are not given, and the order is defined as pick-up red and stack red blue satisfies the intermediary redundancy. Thus, it seems likely following strictly from the other minimal action as required by the request goal to a step for the completion or less complex description.\n\n- Original plan proceeded to handle removal of yellow which won't affect this intermediary goal, or else contrary statement repeat conditions will remain satisfied.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)",

The hand is empty initially, making this action permissible.\n2. **Put down the orange block**: Place the orange block aside, clearing the way to unstack the red block.\n3. **Unstack the red block from on top of the blue block**: The hand is empty, and the red block is now clear after the orange block has been moved.\n4. **Put down the red block**: Set the red block down, as the goal is to eventually pick it up again.\n5. **Pick up the orange block**: Once the red block is down, the hand is empty, allowing you to pick up the orange block.\n6. **Stack the orange block on top of the blue block**: The blue block is clear as required, so the orange block can be stacked on it.\n7. **Pick up the red block**: With the orange block now on the blue one, the hand is empty once more, and you can hold the red block as desired in the goal state.\n\n#### Achieving Final Goal:\n- After these steps, we confirm the final goal where the orange block is now on top of the blue, thus it is clear. Our hand is currently holding the red block, which meets the specified conditions.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack orange red)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up red)",

The yellow block is on top of the orange block.\n6. The red block is on the table.\n7. The blue block is on the table.\n8. The orange block is on the table.\n\n**Goal Conditions Recap:**\n1.

The orange block is on the table.\n8. The yellow block is on the table.\n\n**Reasoning Towards the Goal:**\n\n1. **Unstack the yellow block from the orange block:**\n   - Since the yellow block is on top of the orange block and both are clear, begin by unstacking the yellow block from the orange block.\n   - After unstacking, the orange block becomes clear, and you are holding the yellow block.\n\n2. **Put down the yellow block:**\n   - Place the yellow block on the table to ensure your hand is empty again and to meet the goal of having the yellow block and orange block on the table.\n\n3. **Pick up the red block:**\n   - The red block is clear and on the table. Pick it up so you can stack it on the yellow block next.\n\n4. **Stack the red block on the yellow block:**\n   - Since the yellow block is now on the table and clear, stack the red block on top of it. This fulfills the condition that the red block should be on top of the yellow block.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- The red block is now on top of the yellow block.\n- The yellow block and orange block are clear since nothing is stacked on top of them.\n- The blue block is on the table.\n- The hand is empty after stacking the red block.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red yellow)",

Blue block is on the table.\n\n### Plan Inference:\n1. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block**:\n   - Since the orange block is clear as per the initial condition, we can unstack it from the yellow block. After this action, the hand will be holding the orange block.\n\n2. **Achieving the Goal**:\n   - Now, after unstacking the orange block from the yellow block, the hand is currently holding the orange block, meeting the goal's requirement.\n   - The yellow block remains on top of the red block, and the red block is still on top of the blue block.\n   - The yellow block is now clear because the orange block is no longer on top of it.\n\nAt this point, the goal is satisfied.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange yellow)",
