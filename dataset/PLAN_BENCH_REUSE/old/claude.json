        "answer": "To achieve the goal state, we need to focus on the yellow block, which is currently on top of the orange block. The hand is empty, and both the yellow and blue blocks are clear.\n\nGiven the initial conditions and the goal state:\n1. The yellow block needs to be held by the hand.\n2. The orange block needs to remain on top of the red block.\n3. The blue block needs to stay clear and on the table.\n\nThe most direct action to achieve this is to unstack the yellow block from the orange block. This action will:\n1. Remove the yellow block from the top of the stack.\n2. Place the yellow block in the hand.\n3. Make the orange block clear.\n4. Keep the orange block on top of the red block.\n5. Maintain the blue block's position and status.\n\nThis single action satisfies all the conditions of the goal state without any unnecessary moves.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow orange)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal state, we need to consider the initial conditions and the desired outcome. The key difference is that in the goal state, the blue block is being held by the hand, while in the initial state, it's on top of the yellow block.\n\nGiven the restrictions on actions, we can only pick up or unstack a block if our hand is empty, which it is initially. The blue block is clear and on top of the yellow block, making it eligible for unstacking.\n\nUnstacking the blue block from the yellow block will result in holding the blue block, which is exactly what we want in the goal state. This action will also leave the yellow block clear, matching another condition of the goal state.\n\nThe other conditions (red block being clear and on top of the orange block, orange block on the table, and yellow block on the table) are already satisfied in the initial state and will remain unchanged by this action.\n\nTherefore, the only action needed to reach the goal state is to unstack the blue block from the yellow block.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue yellow)",

To achieve the goal state where all blocks are on the table and clear, we need to unstack them one by one from top to bottom.\n\n3. We start with the red block, which is already clear.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal state, we need to consider the initial conditions and the desired outcome. The key difference is that in the goal state, the orange block is being held, while in the initial state, it's on top of the yellow block.\n\nGiven the restrictions on actions, we can only pick up or unstack a block if our hand is empty, which it is initially. The orange block is clear and on top of the yellow block, making it a valid candidate for unstacking.\n\nUnstacking the orange block from the yellow block will result in holding the orange block, leaving the yellow block clear on the table. This action doesn't affect the position of the red block on top of the blue block, which is already in the desired configuration.\n\nThis single action of unstacking the orange block from the yellow block will satisfy all the conditions of the goal state:\n1. The red block remains clear and on top of the blue block.\n2. The yellow block becomes clear.\n3. The hand will be holding the orange block.\n4.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal state, we need to focus on the following key points:\n\n1. The orange block needs to be clear.\n2. The hand needs to be holding the red block.\n3. The blue block should remain on top of the yellow block.\n4. The orange block should remain on top of the blue block.\n\nGiven the initial conditions, we can see that the red block is already clear and on top of the orange block. The blue block is on top of the yellow block, but the orange block is on top of the blue block.\n\nTo reach the goal state:\n\n1. We need to remove the red block from on top of the orange block to make the orange block clear.\n2. We need to end up holding the red block.\n\nSince the hand is initially empty and the red block is clear, we can directly unstack the red block from the orange block. This action will make the orange block clear and result in the hand holding the red block, which satisfies all the goal conditions.\n\nNo further actions are needed as the blue block is already on top of the yellow block, and the orange block is already on top of the blue block.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red orange)",

To achieve the goal of holding the yellow block while all other blocks are clear and on the table, we need to unstack the yellow block from the blue block.\n\nGiven the restrictions:\n1. We can only unstack a block if our hand is empty (which it is).\n2. We can only unstack a block if it's clear (the yellow block is clear).\n3. We can only unstack a block if it's really on top of another block (the yellow block is on top of the blue block).\n\nTherefore, the only action needed to achieve the goal state is to unstack the yellow block from the blue block.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal state, we need to disassemble the current stack of blocks. Let's analyze the steps:\n\n1. The blue block is on top and clear, so we can unstack it first from the yellow block.\n2. After unstacking, we need to put down the blue block on the table.\n3. Now the yellow block is clear and on top of the orange block, so we can unstack it.\n4. We then put down the yellow block on the table.\n5. At this point, the orange block is on top of the red block, which matches our goal state.\n6. The blue and yellow blocks are already on the table as required.\n\nThis plan will result in the desired goal state: blue, orange, and yellow blocks are clear and on the table, the orange block is on top of the red block, and the red block is on the table.
