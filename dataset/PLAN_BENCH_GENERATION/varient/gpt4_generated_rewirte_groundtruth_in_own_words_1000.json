The orange block is stacked on the yellow block, which in turn is atop the blue block resting on the table. The objective here is to rearrange the blocks so that the red block is positioned on top of the yellow block and the blue block is placed on top of the orange block.\n\nTo achieve this, begin by unstacking the red block from its position on the orange block and set the red block down on the table. Next, move to unstack the orange block from the yellow block and also put the orange block down on the table. Then, unstack the yellow block from its position on the blue block and place it down on the table to clear the path for the remaining actions.\n\nOnce these blocks are down and clear, pick up the red block again and stack it carefully on top of the yellow block.

The red block is sitting on the orange block, and both the blue and orange blocks are on the table. Your goal is to move these blocks so that the red block ends up on top of the blue block, the orange block on top of the red block, and finally, the yellow block on top of the orange block.\n\n1. First, unstack the red block from the orange block. This moves the red block, which is initially on top of the orange block, into your hand.\n2. Next, place the red block you've just unstacked onto the blue block.\n3. Then, pick up the orange block, which is now clear since the red block is moved to the blue block.\n4.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the orange block, and the orange block on top of the yellow block, we start with the initial conditions where the red block is currently positioned on the yellow block, and the blue and orange blocks are on the table, all blocks being clear. Here is the step-by-step plan to reach the goal:\n\n1. Begin by unstacking the red block from on top of the yellow block. This action is possible because the red block is clear, and your hand is empty.\n\n2. Next, stack the red block on top of the blue block. Since you are holding the red block and the blue block is clear on the table, you can perform this action.\n\n3. Then, pick up the orange block. This can be done because the orange block is clear, and your hand is currently empty after stacking the red block.\n\n4. Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block. This action is possible since you are holding the orange block, and the yellow block is clear.\n\n5. Unstack the red block from the blue block. This is allowed because the red block is clear, having nothing on top of it, and your hand is empty.\n\n6. Finally, stack the red block on top of the orange block. At this point, since you are holding the red block and the orange block is clear after being stacked on the yellow block, you successfully complete the goal arrangement. \n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack red yellow)\n(stack red blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(unstack red blue)\n(stack red orange)",

        "answer": "Initially, you have the orange block clear, the yellow block clear, and your hand is empty. The blue block is positioned on top of the red block, and the orange block is stacked on the blue block. Additionally, the red block is on the table, and the yellow block is also on the table. The aim is to have the red block stacked on the yellow block. Here\u2019s how you can achieve this:\n\n1. First, unstack the orange block from the blue block, since your hand is empty and the orange block is clear.\n2. Then, put down the orange block on the table.\n3. Next, unstack the blue block from the red block, since your hand is now empty again and the blue block is clear.\n4. Place the blue block on the table by putting it down.\n5. After making sure your hand is free once more, pick up the red block from the table.\n6.
