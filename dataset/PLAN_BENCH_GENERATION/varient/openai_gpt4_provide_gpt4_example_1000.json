The orange block will now become clear, and the hand will be holding the yellow block.\n\n2. **Put down the yellow block.** \n   - Having the yellow block in hand means it can be put down, allowing the hand to be free for the next sequence of movements.\n\n3. **Pick up the orange block.** \n   - With an empty hand and the orange block being clear post-clearance from the yellow block, this action is achievable.\n\n4. **Stack the orange block on top of the red block.**\n   - The red block was initially clear and remains so following the previous steps. Hence, stacking is permissible, achieving the final configuration with the orange block on top of the red block.\n\nThese moves have been carefully planned to adhere tightly to rules and restrictions presented initially, logically leading from the current state to the desired end condition.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)",

Now the hand holds the blue block, and the orange block is clear.\n\n2. **Put down the blue block.**\n   - After unstacking, you're holding the blue block. You can put it down since the hand is not empty. This action makes the orange block completely accessible for the next step.\n\n3. **Unstack the orange block from the yellow block.**\n   - The orange block is now clear. With an empty hand, you can unstack it, holding the orange block and clearing the yellow block's position.\n\n4. **Put down the orange block.**\n   - This ensures that the orange block is appropriately placed and empties the hand.\n\n5. **Unstack the yellow block from the red block.**\n   - The yellow block is clear and can be unstacked. The hand is now holding the yellow block, and the red block is clear.\n\n6. **Stack the yellow block onto the blue block.**\n   - This is possible by holding the yellow block. The stack repositions the yellow block in a controlled outcome. The blue block is not clear after this step.\n\n7. **Pick up the red block.**\n   - The red block is clear, lying on the table. With an empty hand, you can now pick it up.\n\n8. **Stack the red block on top of the orange block.**\n   - To achieve part of the final goal, while holding the red block, you can stack it on the orange block. The orange block is then no longer clear.\n\n9. **Unstack the yellow block from the blue block.**\n   - You need the yellow block to complete the final goal. Unstacking is possible because the yellow block is clear. Now the hand holds the yellow block.\n\n10. **Stack the yellow block on top of the red block.**\n   - Achieving the last part of the goal, you stack the yellow on the red block.

        "answer": "In order to achieve the desired final configuration from the initial conditions provided for the blocks, we need to execute a specific series of valid moves. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Unstack the red block from the blue block.** \n   - Initial conditions confirm the red block is clear and on top of the blue block, so this move is possible. \n   - Once unstacked, the red block is held in hand, and the blue block becomes clear.\n\n2. **Put down the red block.** \n   - With the red block in hand, placing it on the table clears our hand for further actions.\n\n3. **Unstack the blue block from the orange block.** \n   - The blue block is now clear after unstacking the red block. It is possible to unstack it from the orange block.\n   - Once done, the blue block is held in hand, and the orange block becomes clear.\n\n4. **Put down the blue block.**\n   - The blue block is placed on the table, clearing our hand once again and ensuring it is reorganized for stacking later.\n\n5. **Unstack the orange block from the yellow block.** \n   - With the orange block now clear, this action is valid. We hold the orange block in our hand, and the yellow block becomes clear.\n\n6. **Stack the orange block on the blue block.**\n   - This is an intermediary step necessary for achieving the correct final configuration. The blue block is currently clear. Now the orange block rests on it, fulfilling part of the goal to have the blue on top of the orange.\n\n7. **Pick up the yellow block.** \n   - The yellow block is clear and can be picked up from the table.\n\n8. **Stack the yellow block on the red block.**\n   - This step places the yellow block cleanly on top of the red block. It starts the organized layering needed for the final configuration.\n\n9. **Unstack the orange block from the blue block.** \n   - Here, the orange block is clear again once the rearrangement on it was executed perfectly. We remove it from the blue block correctly with the expectation the move keeps order in parts of the configuration.\n\n10. **Stack the orange block on the yellow block.**\n    - This ensures the orange block is right above the yellow block, maintaining the proper bottom-to-top correct order progress for the final desired stack.\n\n11. **Pick up the blue block.**\n    - With the blue block now clear, we are free to pick it up from its table position.\n\n12. **Stack the blue block on the orange block.**\n    - Finally, we place the blue block on top of the orange one as intended, fulfilling the requirement that the blue is above orange, and additionally having the orange above yellow, while the yellow is on top of red.\n\nEach step is designed to transition from an initial state to the precise configuration demanded by the instructions.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)",

        "answer": "In the given scenario, we start with the initial condition where the red block is clear and on top of the blue block, which is on top of the yellow block. Meanwhile, the orange block remains on the table, and our hand is empty. Our goal is to reposition the blocks so that the blue block sits on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the red block, and the yellow block is on top of the orange block. \n\n1. **Unstack the red block from on top of the blue block.**  \n   - The red block is clear and can be unstacked. By doing this, we hold the red block and make the blue block clear.\n\n2. **Put down the red block on the table.**  \n   - We can perform this action as we are holding the red block. Putting it down retains its status on the table and empties our hand.\n\n3. **Pick up the orange block.**  \n   - The orange block is clear and on the table, allowing us to pick it up with our hand now empty.\n\n4. **Stack the orange block on top of the red block.**  \n   - With the orange block in hand, and with the red block clear on the table, we can stack the orange block on top of the red block.\n\n5. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block.**  \n   - The blue block is clear and at the top of the stack, permitting us to unstack it. The action results in the yellow block becoming clear while we hold the blue block.\n\n6. **Put down the blue block.**  \n   - We proceed to put down the blue block on the table, which frees our hand for the next step. \n\n7. **Pick up the yellow block.**  \n   - Since the yellow block is clear and on the table, we can pick it up with our now empty hand.\n\n8. **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block.**  \n   - The orange block, on top of the red block, is clear, enabling us to stack the yellow block on top of it.\n\n9. **Pick up the blue block.**  \n   - With our hand once more, we can pick up the now clear blue block from the table.\n   \n10. **Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block.**  \n   - With the yellow block on top of the orange block (which is in turn on top of the red block), we provide the final touch by stacking the blue block on top of the yellow block to fulfill the goal.\n\nWith these ten carefully orchestrated actions, the goals are achieved, abiding by the given conditions and restrictions within the set task of stacking blocks.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack red blue)  \n(put-down red)  \n(pick-up orange)  \n(stack orange red)  \n(unstack blue yellow)  \n(put-down blue)  \n(pick-up yellow)  \n(stack yellow orange)  \n(pick-up blue)  \n(stack blue yellow)  ",

Unstack the blue block from the yellow block. This action is permitted as the blue block is clear, and it's necessary for future steps. The hand now holds the blue block, and the yellow block is clear.\n\n6. Put down the blue block on the table, clearing the hand for further moves while ensuring the blue block is accessible.\n\n7. Pick up the yellow block from the table. The yellow block is clear and on the table. This action is valid and makes the hand hold the yellow block.\n\n8. Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block. This step contributes to reaching the goal configuration, with the yellow block properly placed on the orange block and making use of the clear orange block. The hand becomes empty.\n\n9. Pick up the blue block again, which is now on the table and clear, preparing it for the final positioning.\n\n10. Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block, achieving the goal configuration.

This action clears your hand, and the blue block is not clear anymore.\n\n3. **Pick up the yellow block:** \n   - The initial conditions indicate that the yellow block is on the table and is clear, which allows you to pick it up.\n\n4. **Stack the yellow block on top of the red block:** \n   - The red block is clear after the blue block was unstacked from it. This allows for stacking the yellow block on top of the red block. This action leaves your hand empty again.\n\n5. **Unstack the blue block from the orange block:** \n   - The blue block was previously stacked on the orange block and is clear after stacking the yellow block elsewhere, making it possible to unstack it.\n\n6. **Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block:** \n   - The yellow block is on top of the red block, fulfilling one part of the goal state. The blue block is held, and since the yellow is clear again, you can stack the blue block on top of the yellow block. This completes the configuration as desired\u2014a stack with a blue block on top of a yellow block on top of a red block.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack blue red)\n(stack blue orange)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue yellow)",

Now holding the blue block and the red block becomes clear.\n\n2. **Put down the blue block.**\n   - As we're holding the blue block, we can put it down on the table. Hand becomes empty after this action.\n\n3. **Unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block.**\n   - The red block is clear, and our hand is empty, so we can unstack it. Now we're holding the red block, and the yellow block becomes clear.\n\n4. **Stack the red block on top of the blue block.**\n   - Holding the red block, and the blue block is clear (since it's on the table), we can stack the red block on the blue block. The hand is now empty again.\n\n5. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block.**\n   - The yellow block is clear, and with an empty hand, unstacking is possible. Now holding the yellow block, and the orange block becomes clear.\n\n6. **Put down the yellow block.**\n   - Since we're holding the yellow block, we can put it down on the table next to the other blocks.\n\n7. **Unstack the red block from the blue block.**\n   - The red block is on top of the blue block, so with an empty hand, we can unstack it. Now the hand holds the red block, and the blue block becomes clear.\n\n8. **Stack the red block on top of the yellow block.**\n   - The yellow block is on the table and clear, so we can stack the red block on it.

The hand now holds the yellow block, and the orange block is clear.  \n\n2. **Put down the yellow block.**  \n   - This action is possible because the hand is holding the yellow block. The hand is now empty, and the yellow block is no longer in a stack, simplifying future actions.  \n\n3. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block.**  \n   - Since the orange block is clear after unstacking the yellow block, it can be unstacked. The hand now holds the orange block, and the blue block is clear.  \n\n4. **Put down the orange block.**  \n   - This clears the hand, readying it for picking up other blocks. The orange block is placed safely out of the way.  \n\n5. **Pick up the red block.**  \n   - Since the red block is clear and on the table, it can be picked up. The hand now holds the red block.  \n\n6. **Stack the red block on top of the orange block.**  \n   - The orange block is clear and on the table. This step moves towards reaching the goal configuration of having the red block on top of the orange block.

Pick up the yellow block. The yellow block is clear and on the table, so with an empty hand, you can pick it up. You now have the yellow block in your hand.\n\n4. Stack the yellow block on top of the red block. Since you are holding the yellow block and the red block on the table is clear after step 2, you can perform this action. \n\n5. Unstack the orange block from the blue block. Although the current condition does not mention stacking order, you can unstack the orange if it is appropriate based on its current arrangement where the orange block is on top of the blue block. You now hold the orange block.\n\n6. Put down the orange block. This will make your hand empty again, allowing you to proceed with the next steps.\n\n7. Pick up the blue block. With an empty hand and the blue block being clear, you can perform this action. You now hold the blue block.\n\n8. Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block.

The hand is now holding the blue block, and the red block becomes clear.\n\n2. Stack the blue block onto the orange block. The orange block is clear, and the hand is holding the blue block, so this action is possible. This positions the blue block where it needs to be in part of its final goal stack configuration.\n\n3. Unstack the red block from the yellow block. Now that the red block is clear, and the hand is empty after stacking the blue block, this unstacking is valid. The hand is now holding the red block, and the yellow block becomes clear.\n\n4. Put the red block down. This empties the hand and makes the red block available for the next needed configuration.\n\n5. Unstack the blue block from the orange block. The blue block is now clear sitting on top of the orange block, so unstacking is permissible. The hand now holds the blue block, freeing up the orange block.\n\n6. Stack the blue block onto the yellow block. The yellow block is clear sitting on the table, and the hand is holding the blue block, permitting this valid stacking action.

The hand is now holding the blue block.\n   - **Put down the blue block:** Placing the blue block on the table frees the hand and clears the yellow block.\n   - **Unstack the yellow block from the orange block:** With the yellow block clear, it can be unstacked from the orange block. The hand holds the yellow block now.\n   - **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block:** Place the yellow on top of the blue block to free the hand for the next series of actions and arrange the blocks properly.\n   - **Unstack the orange block from the red block:** Now, reassign focus to remove the orange from the stack on the red block. Hold the orange block.\n   - **Put down the orange block:** Temporarily place the orange block down to clear up the red block for the goal.\n   - **Unstack the yellow block from the blue block:** Since the yellow is needed on the orange, unstack it from the blue block. Now, the hand is holding the yellow block.\n   - **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block:** Meet part of the goal by correctly placing the yellow on the orange. The hand becomes empty again.\n   - **Pick up the red block:** Since the final arrangement involves the red block on top of the yellow block, pick up the red block as the last action.\n   - **Stack the red block on top of the yellow block:** Finally, complete the goal configuration by placing the red block on top of the yellow block which is on the orange block.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(unstack orange red)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red yellow)",

This action keeps the blue block clear. \n\n7. **Unstack the red block from the yellow block.**  \n   - The red block can be unstacked from the yellow, as the yellow block is still higher than the red block and does not require stepping over anything.\n\n8. **Stack the red block on the orange block.**  \n   - Finally, with the red block in hand, it can be stacked on the clear orange block, thus achieving the desired configuration.\n\nThis plan ensures all conditions and restrictions are followed and the goal is achieved.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack red blue)\n(stack red yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(stack red orange)",

        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE\n\n1. **Unstack the yellow block from the blue block:**\n   - The yellow block is currently on top of the blue block and is clear. Unstacking it adheres to the conditions of having a clear block and an empty hand. After this action, the hand will hold the yellow block, and the blue block will be clear.\n\n2. **Stack the yellow block on top of the red block:**\n   - The red block is on the table and is clear, allowing the yellow block to be stacked on it. Once done, the hand is empty, and now the red block is not clear because the yellow block is on top of it.\n\n3. **Unstack the blue block from the orange block:**\n   - The blue block is clear because it is not under any other block. This action requires an empty hand, which is available. Holding the blue block after this action makes the hand full.\n\n4. **Put down the blue block:**\n   - The blue block is in hand and can be put down on a clear surface, emptying the hand and clearing the previously held blue block.\n\n5. **Unstack the yellow block from the red block:**\n   - Now, we action to rearrange the blocks. Since the yellow block is clear, it can be unstacked from the red block. Holding it in hand is within the rules.\n\n6. **Stack the yellow block on the blue block:**\n   - Need to reposition to fulfil the goal state for yellow on blue. Hand releases the yellow block on a clear blue block.\n\n7. **Pick up the orange block:**\n   - Orange is on the table clear and can be picked up with an empty hand. This is straightforward, according to hand rules.\n\n8. **Stack orange on the red block:**\n   - The red block is table-clear (initial state) & any previously stacked blocks cleared by prior operations. Holding the orange allows lawful placement on red.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow blue)\n(stack yellow red)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack yellow red)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)",

The goal is to have the red block on top of the yellow block and the blue block on top of the red block.\n\n2. **Unstack the red block from the blue block:**\n   - Since the red block is clear, this action can be taken. The hand will now hold the red block, making the blue block clear.\n\n3. **Put down the red block:**\n   - The hand is holding the red block, so it can be put down on the table, freeing the hand and leaving the red block clear on the table.\n\n4. **Unstack the blue block from the yellow block:**\n   - The blue block is now clear, and since the hand is empty, it can be unstacked from the yellow block. The hand will hold the blue block now.\n\n5. **Put down the blue block:**\n   - The blue block is in hand, and it can be put down, so the hand will be free again.\n\n6. **Pick up the red block:**\n   - The red block is on the table and is clear, allowing it to be picked up, and the hand will hold the red block.\n\n7. **Stack the red block on top of the yellow block:**\n   - The yellow block is clear, so the red block, which is being held, can be stacked on top of the yellow block. Now, the red block is on top of the yellow block, and the hand is free.\n\n8. **Pick up the blue block:**\n   - The blue block on the table is clear and can be picked up, allowing the hand to hold the blue block.\n\n9. **Stack the blue block on top of the red block:**\n   - The red block is now clear, enabling the blue block to be stacked on top of it, achieving the final goal.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue red)",

The hand is now empty, and the yellow block is no longer clear.\n\n   **Step 3:** Unstack the red block from on top of the orange block.\n   - The red block is now clear, so it can be unstacked. The hand now holds the red block, and the orange block becomes clear.\n\n   **Step 4:** Put down the red block.\n   - The red block is put down on the table, making the hand empty.\n\n   **Step 5:** Pick up the orange block.\n   - The orange block is clear and on the table, so it can be picked up. The hand now holds the orange block.\n\n   **Step 6:** Stack the orange block on top of the blue block.\n   - The blue block is clear as it doesn't have any blocks on top of it currently. The orange block is stacked on the blue block. The hand is now empty, and the blue block is no longer clear.\n\nEach action follows the rules provided and moves the blocks towards the desired goal state.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue red)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)",

The orange block is held in the hand.\n\n6. **Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block.**\n   - The yellow block is available and clear on the table, so while holding the orange block, it can be stacked onto the yellow block.\n\n7. **Pick up the blue block.**\n   - The blue block is clear, so it can be picked up from the table.\n\n8. **Stack the blue block on top of the orange block.**\n   - With the orange block on top of the yellow, we need to revert to the statement, stack blue onto orange if correctly interpreted in task context (as it was previously about box goals). The context here will not need this step as 'stack blue orange' isn't part of original end goal, lets continue.\n\n   Instead, as context assumes previous states verified, blue is held temporarily.\n\n9. **Pick up the red block (only if required to complete goals as interpreted from structured details).**\n\n10. **Stack the red block on top of the blue block.**\n    - To achieve the setup where the red block is on top of the blue. Note correction wherever context requires earlier pick action.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack yellow red)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)",

The hand now holds the red block.\n\n2. **Put down the red block.**  \n   - After unstacking, we put down the red block on the table to free our hands.\n\n3. **Unstack the orange block from the blue block.**  \n   - The orange block is clear and can be unstacked from the blue block. The hand now holds the orange block.\n\n4. **Put down the orange block.**  \n   - This clears the way for appropriate manipulation of the blue and yellow blocks. The hand is now empty.\n\n5. **Unstack the blue block from the yellow block.**  \n   - The blue block is clear and now can be unstacked from the yellow block. The hand holds the blue block.\n\n6. **Stack the blue block on top of the orange block.**  \n   - The orange block is on the table, making it clear. We stack the blue block on the orange block as required by the goal, clearing the hand.\n\n7. **Pick up the yellow block.**  \n   - The yellow block is clear and on the table, so it can be picked up.\n\n8. **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.**  \n   - This positions the yellow and blue blocks correctly with respect to the orange block, matching the goal's requirements. The hand goes empty.\n\n9. **Pick up the red block.**  \n   - Since the red block is on the table and clear, it can be picked up.\n\n10. **Stack the red block on top of the yellow block.**  \n    - Finally, place the red block on the yellow block, completing the goal configuration.\n\nThese steps respect the conditions and utilize allowed actions effectively to achieve the desired arrangement.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(stack blue orange)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red yellow)",

This operation leaves you holding the red block while making the orange block clear.\n\n2. **Put down the red block:**\n   - With the red block in hand, you can put it down. This action empties your hand and ensures the red block is on the table, no longer affecting the orange block.\n\n3. **Unstack the yellow block from the blue block:**\n   - Initially, the yellow block is on top of the blue block and clear, which allows the unstacking action. The hand is empty to perform this task, you will be holding the yellow block.\n\n4. **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block:**\n   - The orange block is clear, allowing you to stack the yellow block on top of it. This places the yellow block exactly where it needs to be for the final goal.

Unstacking the orange block makes the yellow block clear and the orange block is held in hand.\n\n2. **Put down the orange block:** After unstacking, put the orange block down. This empties your hand and leaves the orange block on the table.\n\n3. **Unstack the yellow block from the red block:** With the yellow block now clear, unstack it from the red block. The red block is now clear and the yellow block is in hand.\n\n4. **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block:** Place the yellow block on the orange block. This is permissible since the orange block is clear, which keeps your hand empty again and correctly positions yellow in the desired goal.\n\n5. **Unstack the red block from the blue block:** The initial condition allows for unstacking the red block, resulting in the blue block becoming clear while holding the red block.\n\n6. **Put down the red block:** With the red block held, put it back down, ensuring an empty hand.\n\n7. **Unstack the yellow block from the orange block:** Now, unstack the yellow block again to reposition it for the final goal. Hold the yellow block, making the orange block clear.\n\n8. **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block:** Position the yellow block on the blue block, fully achieving part of the final goal by having the yellow on the blue. The hand is empty after this action.\n\n9. **Pick up the orange block:** With the orange block clear and on the table, pick it up to place it correctly in the final configuration.\n\n10. **Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block:** The yellow block is now clear, allowing you to place the orange block on top, thus fulfilling the final goal.\n\nEach step adheres to the rules and accomplishes the target configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack yellow red)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)",

The hand is now empty, and the orange block remains clear.\n\n3. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block.**\n   - The yellow block is clear and positioned on top of the red block, allowing for unstacking. The hand holds the yellow block, and the red block becomes clear.\n\n4. **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.**\n   - The blue block is now on the table and clear, permitting the stacking of the yellow block atop it. The hand is empty after this action, and the blue block is no longer clear.\n\n5. **Pick up the orange block.**\n   - The orange block is clear (as nothing is on top of it) and on the table. The hand can pick it up.\n\n6. **Stack the orange block on top of the red block.**\n   - Now that the red block is on the table and clear, the orange block (in hand) can be stacked on it. The hand becomes empty, and the orange block now covers the red block.\n\n7. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block.**\n   - As the yellow block is on top and clear on the blue block, it can be unstacked. The hand holds the yellow block, rendering the blue block clear.\n\n8. **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block.**\n   - With the orange block on top of the red block, it is clear and can receive the yellow block being held. This final position achieves the goal.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack yellow red)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(stack yellow orange)",

Now, yellow is in hand.\n\n2. **Put down the yellow block.**\n\n   - The yellow block is in hand and must be put down to proceed, freeing up the hand.\n\n3. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block.**\n\n   - With an empty hand and blue clear, this action is possible. Blue is now in hand.\n\n4. **Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block.**\n\n   - Yellow is on the table and is clear, allowing the blue block to be stacked on it. The hand is now empty, with blue on yellow.\n\n5. **Pick up the orange block.**\n\n   - The orange block on the table is clear, and the hand, now empty, can pick it up. Orange is in hand.\n\n6. **Stack the orange block on top of the red block.**\n\n   - The action goal requires orange to be atop red. Red is on the table and is clear. The hand becomes empty by placing orange on red.\n\n7. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block.**\n\n   - Yellow with blue on it is on the table and clear, allowing blue, now the target, to be unstacked. Now blue is in hand.\n\n8. **Stack the blue block on top of the orange block.**\n\n   - Orange (on red) is clear, ready for blue to be added on top. Now, the hand is empty.\n\n9. **Pick up the yellow block.**\n\n   - Yellow, cleared by removing blue, is available to be picked up with an empty hand.\n\n10. **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.**\n\n    - This final step positions yellow on blue, achieving the goal. The hand is now empty, and all blocks are in their goal positions.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow blue)  \n(put-down yellow)  \n(unstack blue orange)  \n(stack blue yellow)  \n(pick-up orange)  \n(stack orange red)  \n(unstack blue yellow)  \n(stack blue orange)  \n(pick-up yellow)  \n(stack yellow blue)",

        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE\n\nInitial conditions:\n- The yellow block is clear.\n- The hand is empty.\n- The blue block is on top of the red block.\n- The orange block is on top of the blue block.\n- The yellow block is on top of the orange block.\n- The red block is on the table.\n\nGoal:\n- The orange block should be on top of the yellow block.\n\nPlan steps:\n1. **Unstack the yellow block from the orange block.** \n   - The yellow block is clear, allowing it to be unstacked from the orange block since the hand is empty. After this action, the yellow block is held in the hand, the orange block is clear, and the blue block is not obscured from the orange block anymore.\n\n2. **Put down the yellow block.**\n   - After unstacking, the yellow block is in hand and can be placed on the table. This action clears the hand, leaving the orange block free and ensuring the yellow block doesn't block further actions.\n\n3. **Unstack the orange block from the blue block.** \n   - Now, with the hand empty and the orange block clear of any blocks on top, the orange block can be unstacked from the blue block. The hand will now hold the orange block, and the blue block becomes clear because nothing is on it anymore.\n\n4. **Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block.**\n   - Since the yellow block is on the table and has no block on it, it's clear. While holding the orange block, you can now stack it on top of the yellow block, aligning with the goal.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(stack orange yellow)",
