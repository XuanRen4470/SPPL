Yellow block needs to be on the orange block:\n      - Pick up (yellow); Now holding the yellow block.\n      \n   e. Stack the yellow block on the orange block:\n      - Stack (yellow, orange); Yellow is on top of orange, the base is ready.\n\n   f. Now, the red block should be on top of the blue, and blue on the yellow. First, unstack blue from red:\n      - Unstack (blue, red); Now holding the blue block, red is on the table.\n   \n   g.

        "answer": "Step 1: Assess the initial condition: The red block is clear and can be unstacked from the blue block if the hand is empty. This unstacking is valid as per the given initial conditions, so \"unstack red blue\" is possible.\n\nStep 2: With the hand holding the red block, it can be put down on the table. This action is allowed when holding a block. Therefore, \"put-down red\" can be executed.\n\nStep 3: With the red block put down and the hand empty, the blue block is now clear and can be unstacked from the orange block, abiding by the rules. This makes \"unstack blue orange\" possible.\n\nStep 4: Once the blue block is unstacked, it can be put down on the table, making it free. The action \"put-down blue\" is valid here.\n\nStep 5: The orange block becomes clear, and the hand is empty again. Therefore, the orange block can be unstacked from the yellow block. This action, \"unstack orange yellow,\" is valid under the conditions.\n\nStep 6: With the orange block in hand, it can be stacked on top of the blue block, given the blue block is now clear on the table. The action \"stack orange blue\" can be executed.\n\nStep 7: Hand is free again to pick up the clear yellow block from the table, which makes \"pick-up yellow\" possible.\n\nStep 8: With the yellow block in hand, it can be stacked on the clear red block on the table. Thus, \"stack yellow red\" is a valid action.\n\nStep 9: To achieve the final goal state, unstack the orange block from the blue block. This makes \"unstack orange blue\" a valid move with an empty hand.\n\nStep 10: With the orange block in hand, it can now logically be stacked on the yellow block, which is clear on top of the red block, making \"stack orange yellow\" a permissible action.\n\nStep 11: The hand becomes empty once again, allowing you to pick up the blue block from the table, ensuring \"pick-up blue\" is possible.\n\nStep 12: Finally, stack the blue block on top of the orange block to fulfill the goal condition of the initial task.

Goal: red block is on top of the blue block, and the orange block is on top of the red block.\n\n3. Unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block: \n   - Since the red block is clear and the hand is empty, unstacking the red block is possible. \n   - The hand now holds the red block.\n\n4. Put down the red block:\n   - The hand is holding the red block, putting it down makes the hand empty again.\n\n5. Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block:\n   - The yellow block is not clear while on the blue block. It is necessary to ensure that the blue block is held by nothing before unstacking. There is a problem here as the initial conditions don't match the ability to unstack yellow from blue because blue is not the top block; unstacking would be invalid unless the scenario has changed before this step. So, this step doesn't logically work with the given description.\n\n6. Without validation to proceed in this plan for goals, the order and specific context are not aligned accurately with constraints in this stated setting. However, let\u2019s follow potential next steps as if corrected:\n\n7. Put down the yellow block: \n   - If the yellow block was already unstacked and clear, putting it down would make the hand empty.\n\n8. Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block:\n   - Assuming blue is atop orange and clear, the hand can unstack the blue block. Now the hand is holding the blue block.\n\n9. Put down the blue block:\n   - The hand is holding the blue block, so putting it down makes the hand empty again.\n\n10. Pick up the red block:\n    - With the red block clear (since it was put down), the hand can pick it up.\n\n11. Stack the red block on top of the blue block:\n    - The hand holds the red block being stacked atop the blue block if blue is clear.\n\n12. Pick up the orange block:\n    - Providing orange is clear again and the hand is empty, pick it up.\n\n13.

The goal is to have the blue block on top of the yellow block and the orange block on top of the red block.\n\n3. We identify the action needed to achieve these goals. First, note that the current stack (blue \u2192 orange \u2192 red) needs to be split so that the blue block can be moved directly above the yellow block.\n\n4. The blue block needs to be moved, which is presently on top of the orange block. Since the blue block is clear and the hand is empty, we can unstack the blue block from the orange block.\n\n5. Once the blue block is unstacked, the orange block will be clear, and we will hold the blue block in hand. Since our goal requires the blue block to be on top of the yellow block, we position to achieve it.\n\n6. We have the blue block in hand. The yellow block is already clear and on the table, making it possible to stack the blue block on top of the yellow block.\n\n7. By successfully stacking the blue block onto the yellow block, the blue block sits as needed per the goal. The orange block remains on top of the red block, fulfilling the second goal.\n\n8.

The orange block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block, the red block is on the table, and the blue block is on the table. The goal is to have the red block on top of the blue block and the orange block on top of the red block.\n\n2. First, unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block. This action is valid because the yellow block is clear. Now, the yellow block is held in hand.\n\n3. Put down the yellow block onto the table. Now, the hand is empty. Both blue block and yellow block are clear.\n\n4. Next, unstack the orange block from on top of the red block. This is allowed because the orange block is clear. Now, the orange block is held in hand.\n\n5. Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block. The orange block is placed on the table and the hand is empty. Now, the yellow block is not clear.\n\n6. Now, pick up the red block from the table, which is allowed since the red block is clear when on the table.\n\n7. Stack the red block on top of the now clear blue block. After this step, the blue block is no longer clear.\n\n8. Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block to continue with further steps to achieve the goal state. Now, we are holding the orange block, which makes the yellow block clear again.\n\n9. Stack the orange block on top of the red block.

        "answer": "Step 1: Identify the initial condition - The red block is clear and on top of the yellow block. The blue and orange blocks are clear and on the table. The hand is empty.\n\nStep 2: Determine the first action - To achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the blue block, we need to first unstack the red block from the yellow block since it's clear and on top.\n\nStep 3: Execute the first action - Unstack the red block from the yellow block. Now the red block is being held, and the yellow block is clear on the table.\n\nStep 4: Consider the next action - Since we need to eventually have the red block on top of the blue block, we must temporarily put the red block down. Since the orange block is clear on the table, we can stack the red block on the orange block.\n\nStep 5: Execute this action - Stack the red block on the orange block within the constraints as the red block is being held and the orange block is clear.\n\nStep 6: Prepare for subsequent actions - We now need to stack the blue block on top of the yellow block to meet one of the goal states. First, pick up the blue block since it's clear on the table.\n\nStep 7: Execute the action - Pick up the blue block. The blue block is now being held.\n\nStep 8: Perform the stacking - With the blue block held, stack it on top of the yellow block because the yellow block is clear and satisfies the goal state condition.\n\nStep 9: Address the final requirement - We need the red block on top of the blue block. First, unstack the red block from the orange block.\n\nStep 10: Execute this action - Unstack the red block from the orange block. This clears the orange block and allows us to hold the red block again.\n\nStep 11: Final stacking action - With the red block held, stack it on top of the blue block.

The orange block is currently on top of the blue block.\n\nStep 3: Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block. This makes the orange block free, and the hand now holds the orange block. The blue block becomes clear.\n\nStep 4: Put down the orange block to free the hand. The orange block is now on the table or the red block is now clear, but since it should finally go on top of the red block, we focus on making the hand free for subsequent actions.\n\nStep 5: Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block. This makes the blue block available for manipulation, leaving the yellow block clear, and the hand now holds the blue block.\n\nStep 6: Put down the blue block. The hand is now empty, and the blue block can be positioned as required in future steps.\n\nStep 7: Unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block. This leaves the red block clear and makes the yellow block available for manipulation.\n\nStep 8: Put down the yellow block. The hand is now empty again, ready to move other blocks.\n\nStep 9: Pick up the red block, as it needs to end on top of the yellow block according to the goal.\n\nStep 10: Stack the red block on top of the yellow block. Now, the red block is no longer clear, but its position fulfills part of the goal.\n\nStep 11: Pick up the orange block, which needs to be placed on top of the red block.\n\nStep 12: Stack the orange block on top of the red block. This action achieves another part of the goal.\n\nStep 13: Pick up the blue block, since it needs to be stacked on top of the orange block.\n\nStep 14: Stack the blue block on top of the orange block.

Now, with the blue block off our hand, we pick up the yellow block, which is also clear on the table, to move it into the desired position.\n\n5. We stack the yellow block on top of the red block, achieving the yellow block on top of the red block as part of the goal condition.\n\n6.

        "answer": "Step 1: We start with the initial conditions where the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, and the hand is empty. The red block is on top of the blue block, and the orange block is on top of the red block. The blue block is on the table, and the yellow block is on the table. \n\nStep 2: Our goal is to have the red block on top of the orange block, the orange block on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n\nStep 3: Since our hand is empty, we begin by unstacking the orange block from the red block. The orange block is clear, allowing us to unstack it. We are now holding the orange block.\n\nStep 4: To make the orange block available for stacking later, we put down the orange block on the table. The hand is now empty.\n\nStep 5: Next, we unstack the red block from the blue block. The red block is clear, so we can unstack it. We are now holding the red block.\n\nStep 6: To clear the hand, we put down the red block on the table. The hand becomes empty again.\n\nStep 7: We pick up the yellow block because the yellow block is clear and our hand is empty. We are now holding the yellow block.\n\nStep 8: We then stack the yellow block on top of the blue block. Our hand becomes empty after this action.\n\nStep 9: We pick up the orange block because now it is clear and our hand is empty. We are holding the orange block.\n\nStep 10: We stack the orange block on top of the yellow block. This makes our hand empty again.\n\nStep 11: Now, we pick up the red block, since it is clear and the hand is empty. We are holding the red block.\n\nStep 12: Finally, we stack the red block on top of the orange block.

Put down the yellow block onto the table. This clears the hand.\n\n10. Pick up the orange block, which was at the bottom and on the table. This is permissible because the orange block is clear now, and the hand is empty.\n\n11. Stack the orange block on top of the red block.

        "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to rearrange the blocks according to the goal, following the given set of actions and the restrictions. We will start by analyzing the current state and what is needed to achieve the goal state.\n\n1. **Initial State Analysis:**\n   - Blue block is clear and on top of the red block.\n   - Red block is on top of the yellow block.\n   - Yellow block is on top of the orange block.\n   - Orange block is on the table.\n   - The hand is empty.\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - Red block on top of the yellow block.\n   - Orange block on top of the blue block.\n\n3. **Plan Step-by-Step:**\n\n   - The initial state has the blue block clear, and it must end up with the orange block on top of it. To achieve this, we must first unstack the blue block from the red block.\n     - Action: unstack blue from red (blue is clear, hand is empty).\n     \n   - After unstacking, put down the blue block onto the table.\n     - Action: put down blue (holding blue block).\n     \n   - Now, the red block is on top of the yellow block.

The red block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, and the blue block is on the table.\n\n3. Goal: The red block needs to be on top of the orange block, and the yellow block needs to be on top of the blue block.\n\n4. First action: Since the red block is already on top of the orange block, the first task is to place the yellow block on top of the blue block. \n\n5. However, the yellow block is under the orange block. Therefore, the orange block must first be moved.\n\n6. Unstack the red block from the orange block to clear the orange block (can do it because the red block is clear), and hold the red block.\n\n7. We need the hand empty to handle other blocks, so let's stack the red block on an already clear block, like the blue block to keep it accessible, or put it down on the table (given we want the yellow block eventually on blue, we should just put the red block down).\n\n8. Putting the red block down frees up the hand.\n\n9. Now, unstack the orange block from the yellow block (orange is clear), and hold the orange block.\n\n10. To free the orange block from our hand and prepare to move the yellow block, put down the orange block onto the empty table. \n\n11. Now, with the hand empty again, unstack the red block from the blue block to ultimately allow the yellow block to move to the blue block.\n\n12. Stack the red block back onto the orange block (red on orange aligns with a final goal state).\n\n13. Pick up the yellow block (now that the orange block, which is clear, has been moved).\n\n14. Finally, stack the yellow block onto the blue block to reach the desired final configuration: red on orange, yellow on blue. \n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red orange) (stack red blue) (unstack orange yellow) (put-down orange) (unstack red blue) (stack red orange) (pick-up yellow) (stack yellow blue)",

Now, the blue block is being held in the hand.\n\n2. **Step 2: Stack the Blue Block on the Orange Block**\n   - We stack the blue block on the orange block. The blue block is no longer being held, and the hand is empty again. We do this to temporarily move the blue block to free the red block.\n\n3. **Step 3: Unstack the Red Block from the Yellow Block**\n   - Since the hand is empty and the red block is clear after the blue block was removed, we can now unstack the red block from the yellow block. The red block is now being held.\n\n4. **Step 4: Put Down the Red Block**\n   - Put down the red block, so it is on the table. The hand is now empty again.\n\n5. **Step 5: Unstack the Blue Block from the Orange Block**\n   - Unstack the blue block from the orange block, since the hand is empty and the blue block is clear. The blue block is now being held.\n\n6. **Step 6: Stack the Blue Block on the Yellow Block**\n   - Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block.

Now, the orange is on the blue block.\n\n9. **Pick up the red block:** The red block is clear and on the table, allowing it to be picked up.\n\n10. **Stack the red block on top of the orange block:** Stack the red block on top of the orange block, which is already on top of the blue block.\n\n11. **Pick up the yellow block:** The yellow block is clear and on the table as a result of previous actions.\n\n12. **Stack the yellow block on top of the red block:** The red block is now clear on top of the orange (on blue), making it possible to stack the yellow block on it.\n\nThese operations should achieve the desired goal.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack orange red)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)",

        "answer": "To solve this block-stacking problem, we'll generate a series of procedural steps following the restrictions outlined. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n**Step-by-Step Inference:**\n\n1. **Unstack the orange block from the blue block:**\n   - Initial condition states that both the red and orange blocks are clear and the hand is empty.\n   - We can unstack the orange block from the blue block since the orange block is clear and on top.\n   - Once unstacked, hand contains the orange block.\n\n2. **Put down the orange block:**\n   - After unstacking, we hold the orange block.\n   - We put down the orange block on the table, making the hand empty again.\n\n3. **Unstack the blue block from the yellow block:**\n   - The blue block is clear and on top of the yellow block, and the hand is empty.\n   - Unstack the blue block. Now, the hand contains the blue block and it\u2019s off the yellow block.\n\n4. **Stack the blue block on top of the orange block:**\n   - The orange block is on the table and therefore clear.\n   - Stack the blue block onto the orange block. This makes the orange no longer clear.\n   - The hand becomes empty after stacking.\n\n5. **Pick up the yellow block:**\n   - The yellow block is clear and on the table, and the hand is empty.\n   - Pick up the yellow block and hold it in hand.\n\n6. **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block:**\n   - The blue block (on the orange) is not clear, so in order to complete the required steps, clarify the inference whether it leads to completely correct final state. Assuming clarification allows to stack blue and orange correctly subsequently.\n   - This leaves the blue block no longer clear and the hand empty again.\n\n7. **Pick up the red block:**\n   - The red block is on the table and clear with the hand empty.\n   - Pick up the red block.\n\n8. **Stack the red block on top of the yellow block:**\n   - The yellow block is clear on top of the blue block.\n   - Stack the red block on the yellow block, fulfilling the final condition. Hand becomes empty.\n\nThe steps comply within the given rules and construct the desired final block arrangement.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n(unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(stack blue orange)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red yellow)",

        "answer": "Step 1: The initial condition states that the yellow block is clear and the hand is empty. The first action involves unstacking the yellow block from on top of the blue block. This is valid because the yellow block is clear, allowing it to be unstacked.\n\nStep 2: After unstacking, the yellow block is being held. The second action is to put down the yellow block. This will make the yellow block no longer obstructing anything.\n\nStep 3: Now the blue block is clear (since the yellow block was on top of it), allowing the next action, which is unstacking the blue block from on top of the orange block. This action is valid as the blue block is clear after the yellow block was put down.\n\nStep 4: The blue block is now being held, enabling it to be put down, as the next action suggests. This will clear the path to access the orange block.\n\nStep 5: With the blue block down, the orange block is clear since the blue block was on top of it. The next action is to unstack the orange block from on top of the red block. \n\nStep 6: With the orange block held and the blue block clear, the action of stacking the orange block on top of the blue block is feasible.\n\nStep 7: Now, with the orange block on top of the blue block, the yellow block is free to be picked up as it was put down earlier and is clear.\n\nStep 8: The final action is stacking the yellow block on top of the orange block, completing the sequence to satisfy the final condition where the orange block is on top of the blue block, and the yellow block is on top of the orange block.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack yellow blue) \n(put-down yellow) \n(unstack blue orange) \n(put-down blue) \n(unstack orange red) \n(stack orange blue) \n(pick-up yellow) \n(stack yellow orange)",

Let's solve this step-by-step with the given constraints:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions:**\n   - The red block is clear.\n   - The blue block is clear.\n   - The hand is empty.\n   - The red block is on top of the yellow block.\n   - The blue block is on top of the orange block.\n   - The orange block is on the table.\n   - The yellow block is on the table.\n\n2. **Goal:**\n   - Red block on top of the yellow block.\n   - Blue block on top of the red block.\n   - Orange block on top of the blue block.\n\n3. **Inference and Planning:**\n\n   - **Step 1:** The initial position of the blue block is on the orange block. To reconfigure blocks, we need to have free pieces we can manipulate. Therefore, you have to change the stack by:\n     - Unstack the blue block from the orange block.\n\n   - **Step 2:** Now the blue block is in hand. Next goal is to place the blue on top of the red block without disturbing the red/yellow configuration:\n     - Stack the blue block on the red block.\n\n   - **Step 3:** Now, we have the blue block on top of the red block, which is on top of the yellow block. Next, we need to move the orange block on top of the blue block. Pick up the orange block:\n     - Pick up the orange block.\n\n   - **Step 4:** Finally, place the orange block on top of the blue block:\n     - Stack the orange block on top of the blue block.\n\nThis sequence of actions will achieve the desired goal configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)",

The blue block is now on the table and our hand is empty again.\n\nStep 3 - Pick up the yellow block:\n- The plan requires us to stack yellow onto blue. The yellow block is mentioned as clear and on the table in the initial conditions, thus we can pick up the yellow block with an empty hand.\n\nStep 4 - Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block:\n- With the yellow block in hand and the blue block clear on the table, we can stack the yellow block on top of the blue block as per the plan.

Now, Yellow is clear and available to stack later.\n3. **Unstack Blue from Orange:** Hand is empty, so unstack Blue from Orange because Blue is clear now.\n4. **Stack Blue on Yellow:** Holding Blue, stack it on top of the Yellow block which is clear.\n5. **Unstack Orange from Red:** Orange is clear, so unstack Orange from Red.\n6. **Put Down Orange:** Place the Orange block on the table, leaving it clear for future stacking.\n7. **Unstack Blue from Yellow:** Unstack Blue from on top of Yellow since it's still clear.\n8. **Stack Blue on Red:** Holding Blue, stack it on top of the Red block.\n9. **Pick Up Orange:** With the hand empty, pick up the Orange block.\n10. **Stack Orange on Blue:** Stack Orange on top of Blue which is currently on top of Red and is clear.\n11. **Pick Up Yellow:** With the hand empty, pick up Yellow.\n12. **Stack Yellow on Orange:** Stack Yellow on Orange to finalize the goal configuration with the Orange block still clear.\n\nNow the configuration meets the goal state: Blue on Red, Orange on Blue, Yellow on Orange.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack yellow blue)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(unstack orange red)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(stack blue red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)",

The initial conditions are that the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on the table, the orange block is on the table, and the yellow block is on the table.\n\n2. The goal is to have the blue block on top of the orange block, the orange block on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block on top of the red block.\n\n3. The red block is initially on top of the yellow block, so we need to move it to achieve the goal. Since the red block is clear, we can unstack it from the yellow block.\n\n4. After unstacking the red block from the yellow block, we put the red block down on the table, leaving the yellow block clear.\n\n5. Now the yellow block is clear, and we need to start building the desired stack. We pick up the yellow block.\n\n6. Stack the yellow block on top of the red block, leaving the yellow block no longer clear, but correctly positioned as the base of the stack we are building.\n\n7. Next, pick up the orange block from the table since it is currently clear and not stacked.\n\n8. Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block. Now the orange block is no longer clear, but the stack is progressing correctly.\n\n9. The last unchanged block is the blue one, which is still on the table and clear. We pick up the blue block.\n\n10. Stack the blue block on top of the orange block.

Now the yellow block is not clear anymore, and the hand is empty.\n\n5. With an empty hand and the blue block clear, we pick up the blue block from the table.\n\n6.

        "answer": "Step 1: Initial conditions state that the orange block is clear and the hand is empty. The orange block is on top of the yellow block.

Currently, the yellow block is on top of the blue block. We need to unstack the yellow block from the blue block.\nStep 5: Unstack the yellow block from the blue block.\nStep 6: Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block temporarily (since it's the only clear place and we need to free the blue block).\nStep 7: Now, we need to free the blue block. Unstack the blue block from the red block.\nStep 8: Put down the blue block to have an empty hand.\nStep 9: We need the yellow block to eventually end up on the red block, so it must be unstacked from the orange block.\nStep 10: Unstack the yellow block from the orange block.\nStep 11: Stack the yellow block on the red block.\nStep 12: Pick up the blue block to prepare for stacking it on the yellow block.\nStep 13: Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block.

        "answer": "Step by Step INFERENCE HERE\n\n1. Initial state: The blue block is clear and on top of the red block, which is on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is on top of the orange block. Orange is on the table. The hand is empty.\n\n2. Goal: The red block should be on top of the blue block, and the blue block should be on top of the orange block.\n\n3. Problem: The initial stack is in the wrong order. We need to unstack and restack without violating the rules.\n\n4. Action: (unstack blue red)\n   Reason: The blue block is initially on top of the red block, and it is clear. By unstacking, we free the red block.\n\n5. Action: (put-down blue)\n   Reason: Now holding blue, need to put it somewhere to free up the hand for the next action. It can be put down because the hand is empty and the table is available.\n\n6. Action: (unstack red yellow)\n   Reason: The red block becomes clear once the blue block is put down. Unstack it from yellow to move it.\n\n7. Action: (put-down red)\n   Reason: The red block needs to be put down to continue reorganizing. Allows red to be clear for final placement.\n\n8. Action: (unstack yellow orange)\n   Reason: Proceed to unstack yellow from orange to create space for further actions. The yellow block becomes clear once it's on top of the orange block.\n\n9. Action: (put-down yellow)\n   Reason: Put down yellow block to free the hand for future activities.\n\n10. Action: (pick-up blue)\n    Reason: With space available on orange, pick up blue to stack later according to the goal requirement.\n\n11. Action: (stack blue orange)\n    Reason: Stack blue on orange, as per the goal\u2019s requirement that blue should ultimately be on orange.\n\n12. Action: (pick-up red)\n    Reason: Red is still not in correct position. Pick it up in preparation to stack it correctly.\n\n13. Action: (stack red blue)\n    Reason: Complete the goal configuration by stacking red on blue.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)",

        "answer": "1. The initial conditions indicate that the orange block is on top of the yellow block. Since we want to unstack the orange from the yellow, our first step will be:\n   - Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block.\n2. Now, the orange block is being held. We need to put it down to free up our hand:\n   - Put down the orange block.\n3. Next, the goal requires the yellow block to be on top of the red block, which means we need to unstack it from the blue block it is currently on:\n   - Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block.\n4. With the yellow block in hand, we need to stack it on top of the orange block as per the goal:\n   - Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block.\n5. Now, we must address the requirement of having the red block on top of the blue block, which means we need to clear the blue block first. It's currently under yellow, so:\n   - Unstack the blue block from on top of the red block.\n6. Once the blue block is free, we must put it on the table:\n   - Put down the blue block.\n7. Now that the red block is free and the blue block is on the table, we pick up the red block:\n   - Pick up the red block.\n8. The next goal condition is to have the red block on top of the blue block, hence:\n   - Stack the red block on top of the blue block.\n9. Currently, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, unlike the goal state, which requires a reverse. Therefore, unstack the yellow block from the orange block:\n   - Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block.\n10. With the yellow block in hand, stack it on top of the red block as per the new target configuration:\n    - Stack the yellow block on top of the red block.\n11. Finally, pick up the orange block to complete the re-stacking as per the specified final condition:\n    - Pick up the orange block.\n12. Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block to finalize the goal configuration:\n    - Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)",

Therefore, we can perform this action.\n\n2. **Put Down the Orange Block**: After unstacking the orange block, our hand is not empty now. So, we put down the orange block to make the hand empty.\n\n3. **Unstack the Red Block from the Yellow Block**: The red block is on top of the yellow block. We need to unstack it since the red block is clear after the orange block has been put down.\n\n4. **Put Down the Red Block**: We put down the red block to make the hand empty.\n\n5. **Unstack the Yellow Block from the Blue Block**: Since the yellow block is clear and on top of the blue block, we can unstack it.\n\n6. **Put Down the Yellow Block**: After unstacking the yellow block, we put it down, making space for the orange block on the blue block.\n\n7. **Pick Up the Orange Block**: Now that our hand is empty, we can pick up the orange block from where we originally put it down.\n\n8. **Stack the Orange Block on Top of the Blue Block**: With the orange block in hand and the blue block being clear after the previous unstacking, we can stack the orange block on top of the blue block.\n\nBy following the above steps, we achieve the goal of having the orange block on top of the blue block.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack orange red)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)",

Initially, all blocks (red, blue, orange, yellow) are clear and on the table. The hand is empty.\n\n2. The goal is to stack the blue block on top of the yellow block first because according to the desired final state, the blue block must be below the red block but on top of the yellow block.\n\n3. **Pick up the blue block**: Since the blue block is clear and on the table and the hand is empty, I can pick up the blue block.\n\n4. **Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block**: The yellow block is clear and on the table, so I can stack the blue block on top of it. Now, the blue is no longer clear.\n\n5. **Pick up the red block**: The red block is clear and on the table, and the hand is currently empty because the blue block was already stacked. I can pick up the red block.\n\n6. **Stack the red block on top of the blue block**: The blue block is currently at the top of the stack on top of the yellow block and is clear. I can stack the red block on top of it. Now, the red block is on top of the blue block, as desired.\n\n7. **Pick up the orange block**: The orange block is clear and on the table, and the hand is empty. I can pick up the orange block.\n\n8. **Stack the orange block on top of the red block**: The red block is currently at the top of the stack and is clear. I can stack the orange block on top of it.

Thus, the action is to \"put down the orange block.\"\n\nStep 3: With the orange block out of the way, the blue block is clear and can be unstacked from the yellow block. So the action is to \"unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block.\"\n\nStep 4: With the hand holding the blue block and the red block being clear on the table, stack the blue block on top of the red block to meet part of the goal condition. Hence, \"stack the blue block on top of the red block.\"\n\nStep 5: Pick up the orange block which was previously put down and is now clear to be picked up in hand.

This action is possible because the hand is empty, and the red block is clear.\n\n3. **Action 1**: (unstack red orange)\n   - Perform the action: Unstack the red block from the orange block. Now, the red block is being held by the hand, the orange block becomes clear, and the red block is no longer on top of the orange block.\n\n4. **Step 2**: Analyze Actions\n   - The red block is being held. We need to place it on top of the blue block to achieve the goal. The blue block is clear and on the table, so the next step is to stack the red block on top of the blue block.\n\n5. **Action 2**: (stack red blue)\n   - Perform the action: Stack the red block on top of the blue block.

Hold the blue block in hand.\n\n3. **Step 2**: Now, stack the blue block on top of the red block. Since the red block is clear and the block in hand is blue, and hand becomes empty afterward.\n\n4. **Step 3**: The orange block needs to be placed under the blue block in the goal state. Pick up the orange block from the table. The hand is empty after stacking blue, and orange is clear.\n\n5. **Step 4**: Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block. This puts orange in the right position according to the final goal structure.\n\n6. **Step 5**: Unstack the blue block from the red block, as we need to position blue on top of orange. This is possible since the blue block is clear and the hand is empty after stacking orange.\n\n7. **Step 6**: Stack the blue block on top of the orange block.

        "answer": "1. Begin by analyzing the initial conditions: The red block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the hand is empty, and both the blue block and yellow block are on the table. The red block is clear, and so is the orange block.\n\n2. Consider the goal condition: the red block is on top of the blue block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is on top of the red block. Notice that achieving this will require rearranging the blocks completely, as currently, none of the conditions are met.\n\n3. The next step is to unstack the orange block from the blue block because we need to place blocks into specific positions. By doing this, we can then move the blue block, which needs to have the red block stacked on it later.\n\n4. After unstacking the orange block, it should be put down to free up the hand, as you can only hold one block at a time.\n\n5. Now, unstack the red block from the yellow block since we need to rearrange the blocks such that the blue block is free, and we'll stack the red block onto the blue block later.\n\n6. With the red block cleared and the hand empty, stack the red block onto the blue block. This accomplishes the first part of the goal, where the red block should be on top of the blue block.\n\n7. The next goal is to have the yellow block on top of the red block, so pick up the yellow block.\n\n8. Having picked up the yellow block, stack it onto the red block. Now two out of three goals are satisfied: the red block is on the blue block, and the yellow block is on the red block.\n\n9. The final goal is to place the orange block on top of the yellow block. Pick up the orange block.\n\n10. Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block to complete the desired arrangement according to the goal conditions provided.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(stack red blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)",

        "answer": "Step by Step INFERENCE HERE:\n\n1. The initial condition has the orange block on top of the blue block. To achieve the goal, we need the blue block clear so we start with unstacking the orange block from the blue block. This can be done as both are clear and the hand is empty.\n\n2. We put down the orange block to free the hand for further actions and make it available for stacking later in the plan.\n\n3. With the blue block now clear, we can pick up the blue block.\n\n4. The blue block is to be stacked on top of the red block as per the goal, so we proceed to stack the blue block on the red block. This makes the red block unclear but is part of achieving the goal.\n\n5. Next, we need to pick up the yellow block, which is clear and on the table, to continue arranging the blocks as per the goal.\n\n6. The yellow block is then stacked on top of the blue block, aligning with one part of the goal.\n\n7. Now we move to the orange block, which was previously put down and remains clear. We pick up the orange block as required in the next step of the goal.\n\n8. Finally, we stack the orange block on top of the yellow block to satisfy the last part of the goal.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)",

To begin, you need to unstack the blue block from the yellow block, because the blue block is clear and your goal is to have the blue block on the table.\n\n2. Once the blue block is unstacked from the yellow block, from the initial condition, the blue block will be in your hand. You should then put down the blue block on the table to make sure it is at the bottom of your goal stack.\n\n3. With the blue block on the table and the hand empty, the yellow block (which is now clear after removing the blue block) should be unstacked from the orange block. \n\n4. After unstacking, the yellow block is in your hand. The yellow block needs to be stacked on top of the blue block to meet the goal condition.\n\n5. Now, your hand is empty again, and the orange block, which has been initially on top of the red block, is clear (from original conditions), so you can unstack the orange block from the red block.\n\n6. At this point, you hold the orange block in your hand, and in your goal stack, the yellow block is already on top of the blue block. You then stack the orange block on top of the yellow block to complete the rearrangement and reach the goal condition.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(unstack orange red)\n(stack orange yellow)",

        "answer": "Step by Step INFERENCE HERE\n\n1. The initial condition specifies that the blue block is on top of the orange block, and we need to have the red block on top of the orange block. Therefore, we need to move the blue block first. Unstacking the blue block from the orange block while ensuring the blue block is clear and the hand is empty makes the first step: (unstack blue orange).\n\n2. After unstacking the blue block, we need to put the blue block down to have an empty hand, thus the next step is: (put-down blue).\n\n3. Now, with the hand empty, we can pick up the red block from the table to move it, with the goal of stacking it onto the orange block, so the next step is: (pick-up red).\n\n4. With the red block in hand, we stack it on top of the orange block to meet part of the goal condition, hence the next step is: (stack red orange).\n\n5. Now, we need to get the yellow block on top of the red block. The hand is empty, and since the yellow block is on the table and clear, we can pick it up, leading to the step: (pick-up yellow).\n\n6. Finally, we stack the yellow block on top of the red block to satisfy the final goal condition, and the step is: (stack yellow red).\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)",

Therefore, the yellow block is clear, and the hand is empty. We need to unstack the yellow block from the blue block because the goal mentions the order with orange on top of yellow.\n\nStep 2: (Unstack yellow blue): Unstack the clear yellow block from the blue. Now, the hand is holding the yellow block, and the blue block becomes clear.\n\nStep 3: (Put-down yellow): Put down the yellow block onto the table. The hand is now empty, and the yellow block is on the table, clear.\n\nStep 4: (Unstack blue orange): The blue block is clear and on top of the orange block. Unstack the blue block from the orange block. Hand is now holding the blue block, making the orange block clear.\n\nStep 5: (Stack blue red): The red block is on the table and clear. Stack the blue block on top of the red block. The hand is now empty, and the blue block is not clear as it's stacked on the red block.\n\nStep 6: (Pick-up orange): Pick up the clear orange block, which is on the table.

The hand is now empty, and the orange block is not clear as it's on top of the yellow block. The yellow block is not clear as it's below the orange block.\n\nStep 8: (Unstack blue red): Unstack the clear blue block from on top of the red block that is on the table. The hand now holds the blue block, making the red block clear. \n\nStep 9: (Stack blue orange): The orange block is not clear because the yellow block is on the table and the orange block is directly on top of it without any block on its top.

Therefore, the first step is to unstack the red block from the orange block.

Therefore, unstack the yellow block from the blue block, which makes the yellow block held by the hand.\n\nStep 4: After unstacking the yellow block, it needs to be stacked on top of the orange block as per the goal condition.

        "answer": "Step 1: The initial condition states that the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table, and the orange block is on the table. The goal is for the red block to be on top of the blue block, and the yellow block to be on top of the red block.\n\nStep 2: The first action is to unstack the yellow block from the red block. The yellow block is clear, and the yellow block is on top of the red block, so it can be unstacked. Unstacking leaves the yellow block in the hand.\n\nStep 3: The next action is to put down the yellow block. Since the yellow block is currently being held, it can be put down. This action makes the hand empty again.\n\nStep 4: The next step is to pick up the red block. The red block is on the table and is clear since the yellow block is no longer on top of it. This action results in holding the red block in hand.\n\nStep 5: The following step is to stack the red block on top of the blue block. The red block is currently being held, and the blue block is clear, so it is legal to perform this action. This action makes the red block be on top of the blue block and leaves the hand empty.\n\nStep 6: The next step is to pick up the yellow block. The yellow block is on the table, is clear, and the hand is empty. Thus, picking up the yellow block is permitted, resulting in holding the yellow block in the hand.\n\nStep 7: Finally, stack the yellow block on top of the red block. The yellow block is being held, and the red block is the top block of the stack on the blue block and clear. Stacking the yellow block on top of the red block completes the desired configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow red) (put-down yellow) (pick-up red) (stack red blue) (pick-up yellow) (stack yellow red)",

        "answer": "Step 1: Initial conditions are given where the orange block is clear, and the yellow block is clear. The hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block, the red block is on the table, and the orange block is on the table. The first step is focusing on the yellow block as it is on top of the blue block and clear.\n\nStep 2: Unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block. Now, the yellow block is held in hand, and the blue block becomes clear.\n\nStep 3: The next goal for the yellow block is to be on top of the orange block. Since the orange block is already clear, you can stack the yellow block on top of the orange block. Now, the yellow block is no longer held, and the orange block is not clear.\n\nStep 4: The blue block is currently on top of the red block, and you need the red block to eventually be on top of the blue block. First, unstack the blue block from on top of the red block. The blue block is now being held, and the red block is clear.\n\nStep 5: Now, the goal is to have the red block on top of the blue block. First, put down the blue block on the table. Now, the blue block is on the table and clear, and the hand is empty.\n\nStep 6: Pick up the red block so it can be stacked onto the blue block.

The goal is to have the red block on top of the blue block, the blue block on top of the orange block, and the orange block on top of the yellow block.\n\n3. Starting with the conditions, first action would be to handle the red block since it is clear. Unstack the red block from on top of the orange block.\n\n4.

To start rearranging, we first need to unstack the yellow block from the red block since the yellow block needs to end up on top of the blue block instead.\n\n2. Perform action: (unstack yellow red). Now, the yellow block is held in hand, and the red block on top of the orange block is clear.\n\n3. Since the goal is to have the yellow block on top of the blue block, we need to put the yellow block down temporarily to free our hand so that other blocks can be manipulated. Perform action: (put-down yellow).\n\n4. Red block is on top of the orange block, which is on top of the blue block. To place the red block on top of the yellow block, the red block needs to be unstacked from the orange block. Perform action: (unstack red orange).\n\n5. Now, the red block is held in hand. We can place the red block on top of the yellow block which is currently on the table. Perform action: (stack red yellow). Now the red block is on top of the yellow block.\n\n6. Next, to achieve the final goal where the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block, which is currently on top of the blue block, needs to be moved. Thus, perform action: (unstack orange blue).\n\n7. Put down the orange block temporarily to free up the hand again. Perform action: (put-down orange).\n\n8. Now, the red block needs to be rearranged, so unstack the red block from the yellow block as the red block needs to be on top of the orange block. Perform action: (unstack red yellow).\n\n9. Place the red block on top of the orange block to continue achieving the goal state. Perform action: (stack red orange).\n\n10. The blue block is clear on the table, so we need to pick it up to move it onto the red block. Perform action: (pick-up blue).\n\n11. Place the blue block on top of the red block.

Our goal is to build a stack where the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, and the orange block is on top of the yellow block.\n\n2. **Action 1 - Pick Up Orange Block**: Since the orange block is on the table and clear, pick up the orange block. Now, you are holding the orange block, and your hand is no longer empty.\n\n3. **Action 2 - Stack Orange Block on Yellow Block**: Place the orange block on top of the yellow block. The yellow block is clear as it is on the table and no blocks initially were on top of it. Release the orange block, making your hand empty again.\n\n4. **Action 3 - Pick Up Blue Block**: With your hand now empty and the blue block clear on the table, pick up the blue block. You are now holding the blue block, and your hand is no longer empty.\n\n5. **Action 4 - Stack Blue Block on Orange Block**: Stack the blue block on top of the orange block. The orange block is clear since you just placed it on top of the yellow block. Release the blue block, making your hand empty again.\n\n6. **Action 5 - Pick Up Red Block**: With your hand now empty and the red block clear on the table, pick up the red block. You are now holding the red block, and your hand is no longer empty.\n\n7. **Action 6 - Stack Red Block on Blue Block**: Finally, stack the red block on top of the blue block. The blue block is clear since it's on top of the orange block. Release the red block, making your hand empty again.\n\nBy following these steps, the stack is constructed as required, with the red block on top of the blue block, the blue block on top of the orange block, and the orange block on top of the yellow block.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)",

Our goal is to have the blue block on top of the orange block.\n\nStep 2: To achieve this goal, first, we need to remove the yellow block from the orange block because the blue block can only be stacked on top of a clear block (and currently, the orange block is not clear since the yellow block is on top of it).\n\nStep 3: We unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block. By doing this, the yellow block will be held in the hand.\n\nStep 4: After unstacking, we need to put the yellow block down on the table to free up our hand for further actions and make the orange block clear.\n\nStep 5: Next, we pick up the blue block from the table since both the blue block is clear and our hand is empty after putting down the yellow block.\n\nStep 6: Finally, we stack the blue block on top of the clear orange block.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)",

        "answer": "Step 1: The initial conditions indicate that the blue block is clear and on top of the orange block. The first goal is to achieve the state where the blue block is not on top of the orange block, allowing further manipulation of the orange block. To achieve this, we can perform the action \"unstack blue from on top of orange\" as the blue block is clear and our hand is empty.\n\nStep 2: After unstacking, the blue block is in our hand. To have our hand empty again and eventually accomplish other stacking tasks, we need to perform the action \"put down blue.\"\n\nStep 3: Now, the orange block is clear because the blue block has been put down. The orange block is currently on top of the red block. Our next objective is to have the red block free to move. Thus, we need to perform the action \"unstack orange from on top of red.\"\n\nStep 4: With the orange block in our hand after unstacking, we need to once again free our hands to pursue further steps. Therefore, we should \"put down orange.\"\n\nStep 5: The red block is now clear and on top of the yellow block, but since the yellow block is on the table, we don't need to do anything with the yellow block. We want the red block to be in a position where it can be restacked. The blue block needs to be on top of the red block eventually, but first, the red block should be positioned correctly. At this point, we can go ahead and \"pick up blue\" since we previously put it down and it is thus clear.\n\nStep 6: Finally, we can complete the desired goal state by performing the action \"stack blue on top of red,\" which is allowed since the blue block is in our hand and the red block (hand empty after stacking) was made clear in step 4.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack orange red)\n(put-down orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue red)",
