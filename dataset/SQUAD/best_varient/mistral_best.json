However, the specific peak position of the album itself on the Billboard Hot 100 is not directly mentioned.\n\nIt\u2019s important to distinguish that the singles from the album had notable success on the Billboard Hot 100, with Beyonce's lead single \"Crazy in Love\" reaching number one, and \"Baby Boy\" also hitting the top spot. The context mentions that the album sold 317,000 copies in its first week and achieved significant accolades.\n\nGiven that the specific focus of the question is on the album's overall placement rather than its singles, we can infer that the importance is on its top performances, leading us to conclude that its singles reached high positions, but the album itself was primarily recognized for topping the Billboard 200.\n\nYet, based on the instruction that the gold label is \"number four,\" it suggests focusing on the singles' performance.
