We need to reverse this order to achieve the goal.\n\nLet's examine the plan:\n\n[PLAN]\n\nSince the plan starts with the hand being empty, we can't pick up any blocks yet. The first action is to unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block. This is possible because the yellow block is clear and it's on top of the orange block.\n\nAfter unstacking the yellow block, we put it down. Now the hand is empty again.\n\nThe next action is to unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block. However, this is not possible because the blue block is not clear (it's on top of the orange block). We need to do something else.\n\nLet's think... We need to get the orange block to be on top of the yellow block. We can do this by stacking the orange block on top of the yellow block. But we need to pick up the orange block first.\n\nThe next action is to pick up the orange block. This is possible because the orange block is clear and the hand is empty.\n\nAfter picking up the orange block, we can stack it on top of the yellow block. This achieves our goal!\n\nSo, the correct plan is:\n\n[PLAN]\nunstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block\nput down the yellow block\npick up the orange block\nstack the orange block on top of the yellow block\n\nThis plan will successfully achieve the goal of having the orange block on top of the yellow block."
