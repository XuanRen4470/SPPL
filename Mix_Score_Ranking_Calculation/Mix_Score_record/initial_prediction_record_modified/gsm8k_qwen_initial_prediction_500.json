Since one story is 10 feet and Tom needs to lower the rope down 6 stories, the total length of rope needed is:\n\n\\[ 6 \\text{ stories} \\times 10 \\text{ feet/story} = 60 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nNext, we need to consider the loss of rope when lashing pieces together. Each piece of rope is 20 feet long, but when lashing two pieces together, 25% of the length is lost. Therefore, the effective length of two pieces of rope lashed together is:\n\n\\[ 20 \\text{ feet} + 20 \\text{ feet} - 0.25 \\times (20 \\text{ feet} + 20 \\text{ feet}) = 40 \\text{ feet} - 10 \\text{ feet} = 30 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nWe need to determine how many pieces of rope Tom needs to buy. Let's start by calculating how many 20-foot pieces are needed if there were no loss. Since 60 feet is the total length required, and each piece is 20 feet, without considering the loss, Tom would need:\n\n\\[ \\frac{60 \\text{ feet}}{20 \\text{ feet/piece}} = 3 \\text{ pieces} \\]\n\nHowever, we need to account for the loss when lashing the pieces together. If Tom buys 3 pieces, he can lash them together in pairs, but we need to check if this is the most efficient way. Let's consider the following scenarios:\n\n1. **Buying 3 pieces:**\n   - Lashing 2 pieces together: \\(20 + 20 - 5 = 35 \\text{ feet}\\) (since 25% of 40 feet is 10 feet, and we lose 5 feet when lashing)\n   - Adding the third piece: \\(35 + 20 - 5 = 50 \\text{ feet}\\)\n   - We still need \\(60 - 50 = 10 \\text{ feet}\\), which is not enough with just one piece left.\n\n2. **Buying 4 pieces:**\n   - Lashing 2 pieces together: \\(20 + 20 - 5 = 35 \\text{ feet}\\)\n   - Lashing another 2 pieces together: \\(20 + 20 - 5 = 35 \\text{ feet}\\)\n   - Total length: \\(35 + 35 = 70 \\text{ feet}\\)\n   - We have 10 feet of rope left over, which is not needed.\n\nSince buying 3 pieces results in a shortfall, and buying 4 pieces gives us the required length with some extra, the most efficient and correct answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]",

        "To determine how much James's favorite basketball player gets paid for the week, we need to calculate the average points scored per game and then use that to determine the payment.\n\nFirst, let's list the points scored in each game:\n- Game 1: 30 points\n- Game 2: 28 points\n- Game 3: 32 points\n- Game 4: 34 points\n- Game 5: 26 points\n\nNext, we calculate the total points scored over the five games:\n\\[\n30 + 28 + 32 + 34 + 26\n\\]\n\nAdding these together step-by-step:\n\\[\n30 + 28 = 58\n\\]\n\\[\n58 + 32 = 90\n\\]\n\\[\n90 + 34 = 124\n\\]\n\\[\n124 + 26 = 150\n\\]\n\nSo, the total points scored in the week is 150.\n\nNow, we calculate the average points per game by dividing the total points by the number of games (5):\n\\[\n\\frac{150}{5} = 30\n\\]\n\nThe average points per game is 30. According to the payment rules:\n- If the average is 30 or more points, the player gets $10,000.\n- If the average is less than 30 points, the player gets $8,000.\n\nSince the average points per game is exactly 30, the player qualifies for the $10,000 payment.\n\nTherefore, the player gets paid \\(\\boxed{10000}\\) dollars for the week.",
        "To determine how many more bags at maximum weight the plane can hold, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of the luggage that the 6 people are already bringing.\n2. Subtract this weight from the total luggage weight capacity of the airplane to find out how much additional weight the plane can hold.\n3. Determine how many more bags at the maximum weight (50 pounds) can be added to the plane with the remaining capacity.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total weight of the luggage that the 6 people are already bringing. Each person has 5 bags, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. Therefore, the weight of the luggage for one person is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ bags/person} \\times 50 \\text{ pounds/bag} = 250 \\text{ pounds/person} \\]\nSince there are 6 people, the total weight of the luggage is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ people} \\times 250 \\text{ pounds/person} = 1500 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract this weight from the total luggage weight capacity of the airplane to find out how much additional weight the plane can hold:\n\\[ 6000 \\text{ pounds} - 1500 \\text{ pounds} = 4500 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many more bags at the maximum weight (50 pounds) can be added to the plane with the remaining capacity. We do this by dividing the remaining weight capacity by the weight of one bag:\n\\[ \\frac{4500 \\text{ pounds}}{50 \\text{ pounds/bag}} = 90 \\text{ bags} \\]\n\nTherefore, the plane can hold \\(\\boxed{90}\\) more bags at maximum weight.",
        "To determine how much money Salvadore and Santo earned together, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify how much money Salvadore earned.\n2. Calculate how much money Santo earned.\n3. Add the amounts earned by Salvadore and Santo together.\n\nFirst, we know that Salvadore earned $1956. Santo earned half of what Salvadore earned. Therefore, we calculate Santo's earnings as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Santo's earnings} = \\frac{1956}{2} = 978\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the earnings of Salvadore and Santo together:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total earnings} = \\text{Salvadore's earnings} + \\text{Santo's earnings} = 1956 + 978 = 2934\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money earned by the two men together is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2934}\n\\]"
