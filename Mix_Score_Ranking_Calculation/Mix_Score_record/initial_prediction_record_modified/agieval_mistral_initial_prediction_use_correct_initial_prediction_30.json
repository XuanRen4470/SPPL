        "The answer is D. If you do not participate in the English tutoring class, you cannot pass the graduate entrance exam. This option best strengthens the argument by emphasizing the importance of English tutoring classes for passing the graduate entrance exam, as stated in the text.\n\nFinal Answer: D",
        "The answer is (D) Some of the newly built houses in Hexi Village are not small property houses.\n\nThe argument states that all small property houses are not subject to registration and are not protected by law. However, if some of the newly built houses in Hexi Village are not small property houses, then they may be protected by law if they have gone through the necessary registration process. This weakens the argument that all houses in Hexi Village, including the newly built one in question, are not protected by law.\n\nFinal Answer: D",
        "The answer is (D) The brain cannot process too much information in detail at the same time, and will only selectively focus on the things most relevant to the behavior.\n\nThe argument assumes that the thalamus pillow plays a role in sorting out external stimulus information and focusing human attention on the most important information for behavior and survival. This implies that the brain cannot process all information in detail at once and needs to prioritize certain information over others. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\nFinal Answer: D",
        "The answer is (D) The microwave only heats the water molecules in the food, the food does not change chemically.\n\nExplanation:\nThe statement suggests that microwave heating changes the molecular structure of food, producing unrecognizable and potentially toxic molecules that can cause health problems. However, option D states that the microwave only heats the water molecules in the food, and the food does not change chemically. This directly contradicts the statement and provides evidence that microwave heating does not cause the health concerns mentioned in the statement.\n\nFinal Answer: D",
        "Based on the information provided in the statement and the options, the answer is (B) \"Some experts analyzed the fossil's long axis, crown shape, crown lip and tongue surface protrusion and enamel, etc., that this fossil is not a human incisor fossil, but a deer tooth fossil.\"\n\nThis option casts doubt on the opinions of the experts who believe that the tooth fossil is evidence of human activity at the Zhangkoudong site 110,000 years ago, as it suggests that the fossil is not actually a human tooth at all, but rather a deer tooth. This would mean that there is no evidence of human activity at the site during that time period.\n\nFinal Answer: B",
        "Based on the information given, the answer is D) Ding is a female doctor.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. We know that there are three women with Ph.D. degrees among the seven candidates.\n2. We also know that the final appointment was a female doctor.\n3. Since we don't have enough information to determine which of the three women with Ph.D. degrees was appointed, we can't say for sure that A, B, or C is the female doctor.\n4. However, we do know that D is a female, and we don't know her educational level.\n5. Therefore, the only option that can be derived from the information given is that D is a female doctor.\n6. The other options (A, B, and C being male or female doctors, or Geng being male or female) cannot be determined based on the given information.\n\nFinal Answer: D",
        "The answer is (A) \"The raw materials of these canoes cannot be transported from the distant Yunnan virgin forest, they can only be obtained locally.\"\n\nExplanation: The argument is that the similarity of the wood used in the canoes discovered in Henan and the wood from tropical regions of Yunnan indicates that the climate in ancient Henan was tropical. Option A supports this argument by suggesting that the raw materials for the canoes could not have been transported from Yunnan, implying that they must have been obtained locally in Henan during ancient times when the climate was tropical. This makes it more likely that the similarity in the wood is due to the ancient climate in Henan rather than the transportation of wood from Yunnan in modern times.\n\nFinal Answer: A",
        "The answer is (B) because during the Carboniferous period when the oxygen concentration in the earth's atmosphere was much higher than the current level, there were many giant insects on earth, supporting the argument that the amount of oxygen content can determine the size of insects.\n\nFinal Answer: B"
