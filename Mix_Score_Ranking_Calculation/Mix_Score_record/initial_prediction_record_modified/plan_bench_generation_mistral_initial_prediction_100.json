To obtain the desired order (red, orange, blue, yellow), we need to follow the steps in the plan.\n\nFirst, we unstack the red block from on top of the orange block and stack it on top of the yellow block. This places the red block in the correct position for the final stack, and frees up the orange block to be moved.\n\nNext, we pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the blue block. This places the orange block in the correct position for the middle stack, and frees up the blue block to be moved.\n\nFinally, we unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block and stack it on top of the blue block. This places the red block in the correct position for the top stack, and completes the goal.\n\nAt each step, we follow the rules you provided to ensure that the blocks are moved and stacked correctly.
