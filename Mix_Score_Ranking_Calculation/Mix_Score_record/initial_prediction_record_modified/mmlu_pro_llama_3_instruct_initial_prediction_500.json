        "The correct answer is (E): \"It prevents the moons from colliding with each other.\"\n\nThe 1:2:4 resonance in the Jupiter's moons system refers to the orbital period ratio between Io, Europa, and Ganymede, which are the three largest moons of Jupiter. The resonance means that for every one orbit of Io around Jupiter, Europa orbits twice, and Ganymede orbits four times. This resonance prevents the moons from colliding with each other, as their orbits are synchronized to maintain a stable distance from each other.\n\nThis resonance is thought to have arisen due to gravitational interactions between the moons and Jupiter, and it has played a crucial role in shaping the evolution of the Jupiter's moons system.",

        "I'd be happy to help!\n\nThe correct answer is (A): \"They reflect enough of the sun's light to make them brighter than most background stars\".\n\nAsteroids are typically small and dark, but they can reflect enough sunlight to make them stand out against the background of fainter stars. This is because asteroids are rocky bodies that have a high albedo (reflectivity), which means they can reflect a significant amount of sunlight. This makes them visible to telescopes and other sky survey instruments, even from great distances.",

        "The correct answer is (A): \"Large meteorites disintegrate in the Earth's atmosphere, creating smaller particles that cause a meteor shower.\"\n\nMeteor showers occur when small particles from space, such as meteoroids, enter the Earth's atmosphere and burn up, producing a bright streak of light in the sky, commonly known as a meteor or shooting star. The majority of meteoroids that cause meteor showers are small pieces of debris that break off from asteroids or comets and enter the Earth's atmosphere. As they enter the atmosphere, they are heated by friction and burn up, producing the bright streak of light that we see.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\n* Option B is incorrect because near-Earth asteroids do not disintegrate and spread out along their orbital paths. Instead, they can be responsible for producing meteor showers when they enter the Earth's atmosphere.\n* Option C is incorrect because asteroid impacts elsewhere in the solar system do not throw sand-sized particles into space that can cause meteor showers.\n* Option D is incorrect because the disintegration of planets in our solar system does not produce the small particles that cause meteor showers.\n* Option E is incorrect because the gravitational pull of the moon does not cause rocks on its surface to be ejected into space and enter the Earth's atmosphere.\n* Option F is incorrect because meteor showers are not caused by the Earth passing through the tail of a comet.\n* Option G is incorrect because the disintegration of distant stars does not produce the small particles that cause meteor showers.\n* Option H is incorrect because near-Earth asteroids do not disintegrate as they enter the Earth's atmosphere, creating hundreds of bright meteors that appear to radiate from a single location in the sky.\n* Option I is incorrect because the disintegration of satellites and space debris does not produce the small particles that cause meteor showers.\n* Option J is incorrect because the nuclei of comets do not gradually disintegrate and spread out along their orbital paths. Instead, comets can produce meteor showers when they enter the Earth's atmosphere.",

This is because the light is reflected off the top and bottom surfaces of the oil layer, and the path difference between the two reflected beams is equal to the thickness of the oil layer.\n\nSince the oil layer is thin (500 nm), we can assume that the path difference is small compared to the wavelength of light.

        "I'd be happy to help!\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The meterstick on one spaceship is measured to be 60 cm long by an occupant of the other spaceship. This means that the length of the meterstick is contracted due to special relativity.\n2. Since the meterstick is contracted, its length is measured to be 60 cm, which is shorter than its proper length of 1 meter.\n3. This means that the relative speed between the two spaceships is significant, causing the length contraction.\n4. Since the speeds are equal and opposite, the relative speed between the two spaceships is twice the speed of each spaceship.\n5. The relative speed is equal to the speed of light times the gamma factor (\u03b3), which is given by:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the relative speed and c is the speed of light.\n\n6. Since the length contraction is significant, the gamma factor is close to 1.5 (which is approximately the square root of 2).\n7.

We can write:\n\np = mv\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for force, we get:\n\nF = dp/dt = d(mv)/dt\n\nSince the mass of the electron is constant, we can pull it out of the derivative:\n\nF = m * dv/dt\n\nNow, we can use the equation for acceleration:\n\na = dv/dt\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for force, we get:\n\nF = m * a\n\nSubstituting the values we know, we get:\n\nF = (-1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 C) * (10^8 cm/sec) / (10^-7 sec)\n\nF = 1.6 \u00d7 10^-7 N\n\nNow, we can use the equation:\n\nE = F / q\n\nSubstituting the values we know, we get:\n\nE = 1.6 \u00d7 10^-7 N / (-1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 C)\n\nE = 1 \u00d7 10^2 statV/cm\n\nFinally, we can use the equation:\n\nV = Ed\n\nSubstituting the values we know, we get:\n\nV = 1 \u00d7 10^2 statV/cm * 10 cm\n\nV = 10 statV\n\nConverting this to volts, we get:\n\nV = 10 statV / 3.3 \u00d7 10^4 statV/V = 0.3 V\n\nSo, the correct option is:\n\n(C): \"3.0 \u00d7 10^-3 statV/cm and 10.0 V\"\n\nNote that the question asks for the electric field strength and the voltage between the two points, but it does not specify the direction of the electric field. In this problem, we are assuming that the electric field is pointing in the direction of motion, but in general, the electric field could be pointing in any direction.",

A 75 candlepower lamp emits 75 times as much light as a standard candle.\n\nThe illumination at a certain distance is measured in foot-candles, which is the amount of light that falls on a surface one foot square. Since the lamp is 5 feet away, the illumination would be 75 candlepower / 5 feet = 15 foot-candles.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the illumination 5 feet from the lamp, which means we need to find the illumination at the surface directly under the lamp. This is given by the formula:\n\nIllumination (in foot-candles) = Candlepower (in candlepower) / Distance (in feet)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nIllumination = 75 candlepower / 5 feet = 15 foot-candles\n\nSo the correct answer is indeed (A): \"5 foot-candles\".",

The net dispersion is given by the difference between the dispersive powers of the two prisms:\n\nNet dispersion = \u03b4D - \u03b4'D\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nNet dispersion = 0.031 - 0.018\n\nNet dispersion = 0.013\n\nSo, the net dispersion of the direct-vision prism is 0.013\u00b0.\n\nComparing this with the options, we find that the correct answer is:\n\n(B): \"Apex angle of the crown-glass prism is 10.8 degrees and net dispersion of the direct-vision prism is 0.111 degrees\"\n\nNote that the net dispersion given in the option is incorrect, but the apex angle is correct.",

        "Let's break this problem down step by step!\n\n1. The mate tosses the bricks vertically upward, which means the bricks are moving upwards with an initial velocity of 0 ft/s (since they're being tossed upwards).\n2. The bricks have a speed of 6 ft/s when they reach the bricklayer, which means they've gained an upward velocity of 6 ft/s.\n3. Since the bricks are being tossed vertically, the only force acting on them is gravity (g = 32.2 ft/s\u00b2). This means the bricks are accelerating downwards at a rate of 32.2 ft/s\u00b2.\n4. To find the initial velocity of the bricks when they were tossed by the mate, we can use the equation: v\u00b2 = v0\u00b2 + 2as, where v is the final velocity (6 ft/s), v0 is the initial velocity (0 ft/s), a is the acceleration (32.2 ft/s\u00b2), and s is the distance traveled (10 ft, since the bricks are 10 ft below the bricklayer).\n\nSolving for v0, we get:\n\nv0 = \u221a(v\u00b2 - 2as)\n= \u221a(6\u00b2 - 2 \u00d7 32.2 \u00d7 10)\n= \u221a(36 - 644)\n= \u221a-608\n= 24.7 ft/s\n\nSo the bricks were initially traveling at a speed of approximately 24.7 ft/s when they were tossed by the mate.\n\n5. Now, let's find the total energy the mate used to toss the bricks. The initial kinetic energy (KE) of the bricks is:\n\nKE = 0.5 \u00d7 m \u00d7 v0\u00b2\n= 0.5 \u00d7 m \u00d7 (24.7 ft/s)\u00b2\n\nwhere m is the mass of the brick (let's assume it's 1 kg, or 2.2 lbs). Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nKE = 0.5 \u00d7 1 kg \u00d7 (24.7 ft/s)\u00b2\n= 24.7 J\n\nThe mate also did work against gravity to lift the bricks 10 ft, which means the mate did potential energy (PE) work:\n\nPE = m \u00d7 g \u00d7 h\n= 1 kg \u00d7 9.8 m/s\u00b2 \u00d7 3.3 m (converting 10 ft to meters)\n= 32.7 J\n\nThe total energy the mate used is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies:\n\nTotal Energy = KE + PE\n= 24.7 J + 32.7 J\n= 57.4 J\n\n6. Finally, let's find the percentage of the energy that serves no useful purpose. Since the bricklayer receives the bricks with a speed of 6 ft/s, the bricklayer doesn't do any work to lift the bricks. This means the potential energy the mate did work against gravity is wasted energy.\n\nThe percentage of wasted energy is:\n\nPercentage of wasted energy = (PE / Total Energy) \u00d7 100%\n= (32.7 J / 57.4 J) \u00d7 100%\n= 56.9%\n\nSo, the correct answer is not among the options provided.

The payload, which is released at the same time, will also have moved 400 m north due to the plane's motion.\n\nSince the payload is still falling due to gravity, it will have also fallen 80 m (approximately, since g = 9.8 m/s^2 and 4.0 s * 9.8 m/s^2 is approximately 39.2 m).\n\nSo, the velocity of the payload relative to the plane is 80 m/s north (due to the plane's motion) and 40 m/s down (due to gravity).\n\nThe correct option is:\n\n(J) \"100 m/s north and 40 m/s down\"",

As it slides down the incline, some of this energy is converted to kinetic energy due to the force of gravity. However, the total mechanical energy (the sum of potential and kinetic energy) remains conserved.\n\nSince the object does not rotate, the work done by friction is converted to thermal energy, which is not accounted for in the mechanical energy. However, the total mechanical energy remains the same, which means that the kinetic energy at the bottom of the incline is equal to the gravitational potential energy at the top.\n\nOption (A) correctly states that the kinetic energy at the bottom is equal to the block's gravitational potential energy when it was released, because total mechanical energy must be conserved.",

Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\nK1 = K2 + K3\n\nSubstituting the expressions for K1, K2, and K3, we get:\n\n(1/2) \u00d7 4m \u00d7 v^2 = (1/2) \u00d7 4m \u00d7 v^2/2 + (1/2) \u00d7 m \u00d7 v'^2\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nv^2 = v'^2/4 + v'^2/2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nv^2 = 3v'^2/4\n\nNow, we can find v' by solving for v' in the equation:\n\nv'^2 = 4v^2/3\n\nv' = \u00b1\u221a(4v^2/3)\n\nSince the velocity is positive, we take the positive square root:\n\nv' = \u221a(4v^2/3)\n\nv' = 2v/\u221a3\n\nNow, we can find the correct option by looking at the options:\n\nThe correct option is (E): \"2v\"\n\nSo, the correct answer is E.",

The acceleration due to gravity is constant, and since the object has already fallen a distance h during the first second, it will continue to accelerate downward at the same rate.\n\nIn the next second, the object will continue to fall, and its distance fallen will be the same as the distance it fell in the first second, which is h. Therefore, the distance it will fall during the next second is also h.\n\nHowever, since the object is already in motion, it will not start from rest again. It will continue to fall with the same acceleration, and its distance fallen will be the sum of the distances it fell in the first and second seconds.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 0.5h, which is the distance it will fall during the next second, added to the distance it fell in the first second, which is h.",

We want to find the solar flux on Europa, which is receiving the same amount of solar energy as Earth.\n3. Jupiter's orbital distance is roughly 5 AU. Since the solar flux decreases with the square of the distance, we can calculate the new solar flux on Europa as:\n\nNew solar flux = (1380 W/m2) / (5 AU)^2\n= 1380 W/m2 / 25\n= 55.2 W/m2\n\nSo, Europa receives about 55.2 W/m2 of solar energy.\n\n4. Now, we need to find out how many times brighter the Sun would have to be on Europa to achieve the same solar flux as on Earth. To do this, we can divide the original solar flux on Earth by the new solar flux on Europa:\n\nBrightness ratio = 1380 W/m2 / 55.2 W/m2\n= 25\n\nThis means the Sun would have to be 25 times brighter on Europa to receive the same solar flux as on Earth.\n\nComparing this to the options, the correct answer is:\n\n(G) \"25 times brighter\"",

We can set up the following equation:\n\nQ = m_alcohol c_alcohol (75\u00b0 C - 46\u00b0 C) + m_water c_water (46\u00b0 C - 30\u00b0 C)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n(1000 g) (c) (16\u00b0 C) = (500 g) (c_alcohol) (29\u00b0 C) + (500 g) (c_water) (16\u00b0 C)\n\nNow, we can solve for c_alcohol. Rearranging the equation, we get:\n\nc_alcohol = ((1000 g) (c) (16\u00b0 C) - (500 g) (c_water) (16\u00b0 C)) / (500 g) (29\u00b0 C)\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nc_alcohol = ((1000 g) (c) (16\u00b0 C) - (500 g) (4.184 J/g\u00b0C) (16\u00b0 C)) / (500 g) (29\u00b0 C)\n\nc_alcohol = ((1000 g) (c) (16\u00b0 C) - 211.2 J) / 1450 J\n\nc_alcohol = (c) (25.6\u00b0 C) - 0.146 J/g\u00b0C\n\nNow, we can solve for c:\n\nc = (c_alcohol + 0.146 J/g\u00b0C) / 25.6\u00b0 C\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nc = (0.590 cal/g\u00b0C + 0.146 J/g\u00b0C) / 25.6\u00b0 C\n\nc = 0.590 cal/g\u00b0C\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n(B) \".590 cal/g\u00b0C\"",

This means that the angular resolution of his eye is just sufficient to see the interference fringes. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n\u0394x = 589 nm \\* (1 m / (1 m \\* tan(1 minute of arc)))\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n\u0394x = 3.525 mm\n\nSo, the correct option is (B): 3.525 mm.",

Let's call the equilibrium temperature T_e.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\nT_e = 70.0\u00b0C - \u0394T_coffee\n\nSubstituting the expression for \u0394T_coffee, we get:\n\nT_e = 70.0\u00b0C - 1.5\u0394T_aluminum\n\nWe can also set up the equation:\n\nT_e = 20.0\u00b0C + \u0394T_aluminum\n\nEquating the two expressions for T_e, we get:\n\n70.0\u00b0C - 1.5\u0394T_aluminum = 20.0\u00b0C + \u0394T_aluminum\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n\u0394T_aluminum = 25.0\u00b0C\n\nNow we can find the equilibrium temperature:\n\nT_e = 20.0\u00b0C + \u0394T_aluminum = 20.0\u00b0C + 25.0\u00b0C = 45.0\u00b0C\n\nHowever, this is not an option. Let's check the calculation again.\n\nWe can also find the change in temperature of the coffee:\n\n\u0394T_coffee = \u0394T_e = T_e - 70.0\u00b0C = 45.0\u00b0C - 70.0\u00b0C = -25.0\u00b0C\n\nThis means the coffee has cooled down to 45.0\u00b0C.\n\nNow, let's find the equilibrium temperature:\n\nT_e = 70.0\u00b0C - \u0394T_coffee = 70.0\u00b0C + 25.0\u00b0C = 95.0\u00b0C\n\nThis is not an option either. Let's check the calculation again.\n\nWe can also find the change in temperature of the aluminum cup:\n\n\u0394T_aluminum = \u0394T_e = T_e - 20.0\u00b0C = 45.0\u00b0C - 20.0\u00b0C = 25.0\u00b0C\n\nThis means the aluminum cup has heated up to 45.0\u00b0C.\n\nNow, let's find the equilibrium temperature:\n\nT_e = 20.0\u00b0C + \u0394T_aluminum = 20.0\u00b0C + 25.0\u00b0C = 45.0\u00b0C\n\nThis is not an option either. Let's check the calculation again.\n\nWait a minute! We can find the equilibrium temperature by finding the average of the initial temperatures of the coffee and the aluminum cup:\n\nT_e = (70.0\u00b0C + 20.0\u00b0C) / 2 = 45.0\u00b0C\n\nThis is an option!

Therefore, the target is actually the point directly above the firing location, which is the North Pole.\n\nTo find the horizontal distance, we need to subtract the latitude from the range:\n\nHorizontal distance = Range * cos(50\u00b0) \u2248 262.4 km * 0.6428 \u2248 168.5 km\n\nSince we're asked to find the distance in meters, we'll convert this to meters:\n\nHorizontal distance \u2248 168500 m\n\nNow, let's find the direction.

The total kinetic energy before the collision is $\\frac{1}{2}mu_1^2$, and the total kinetic energy after the collision is $\\frac{3}{2}mv^2$ (since the particle of mass $2m$ has the same velocity as the particle of mass $m$).\n5.

The total mass is:\n\nTotal mass = 7 pounds + 133 pounds = 140 pounds\n\nThe final momentum is:\n\nMomentum of rifle, man, and bullet = mass of rifle + mass of man + mass of bullet * final velocity of rifle, man, and bullet\n\nThe mass of the bullet is 1 ounce, which is approximately 0.0625 pounds. The final velocity of the rifle, man, and bullet is the sum of the initial velocity of the rifle and man (0) and the velocity of the bullet (1120 ft/s). The total final velocity is:\n\nTotal final velocity = 0 + 1120 ft/s = 1120 ft/s\n\nThe momentum of the rifle, man, and bullet is:\n\nMomentum of rifle, man, and bullet = 140 pounds * 1120 ft/s\n\nTo find the recoil speed of the rifle and man, we need to subtract the initial momentum from the final momentum:\n\nRecoil speed = (Momentum of rifle, man, and bullet) - (Momentum of rifle and man)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nRecoil speed = (140 pounds * 1120 ft/s) - (140 pounds * 0 ft/s) = 15680 ft/s\n\nSince the recoil speed is the opposite of the total final velocity, the recoil speed of the rifle and man is -15680 ft/s.\n\n(c) If the bullet imbeds itself in a block of wood weighing 3 pounds and 7 ounces and if the block were free to move, the final momentum is:\n\nMomentum of block and bullet = mass of block + mass of bullet * final velocity of block and bullet\n\nThe mass of the block is 3 pounds and 7 ounces, which is approximately 3.4375 pounds. The mass of the bullet is 1 ounce, which is approximately 0.0625 pounds. The total mass is:\n\nTotal mass = 3.4375 pounds + 0.0625 pounds = 3.5 pounds\n\nThe final velocity of the block and bullet is the sum of the initial velocity of the block (0) and the velocity of the bullet (1120 ft/s). The total final velocity is:\n\nTotal final velocity = 0 + 1120 ft/s = 1120 ft/s\n\nThe momentum of the block and bullet is:\n\nMomentum of block and bullet = 3.5 pounds * 1120 ft/s\n\nTo find the speed of the block and bullet, we can divide the momentum by the mass:\n\nSpeed of block and bullet = Momentum of block and bullet / Total mass\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nSpeed of block and bullet = (3.5 pounds * 1120 ft/s) / 3.5 pounds = 1120 ft/s\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n(a) If the rifle is free to move, the recoil speed is -1120 ft/s, which is not present in any of the options.\n\n(b) If the rifle is held tight against the shoulder of a man weighing 133 pounds, the recoil speed of the rifle and man is -15680 ft/s, which is not present in any of the options.\n\n(c) If the bullet imbeds itself in a block of wood weighing 3 pounds and 7 ounces and if the block were free to move, the speed of the block and bullet is 1120 ft/s, which is not present in any of the options.\n\nHowever, we can try to find the closest option by considering the magnitude of the recoil speed. The recoil speed of the rifle and man in option (B) is 14 ft/s, which is close to the magnitude of the recoil speed we calculated (15680 ft/s).\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n(B): \"Recoil speed: 14 ft/sec backwards, 0.8 ft/sec backwards, 22 ft/sec forwards\"",
        "I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the concept of impulse and momentum. The impulse (J) is the change in momentum (\u0394p) of the object, and it is equal to the force (F) multiplied by the time (t) over which the force is applied.\n\nThe initial velocity of the man is 0 m/s, and the final velocity is 0 m/s (since he comes to rest in the water). The change in momentum is therefore:\n\n\u0394p = m * (v_f - v_i) = 100 kg * (0 m/s - 0 m/s) = 0 kg m/s\n\nThe impulse is therefore:\n\nJ = \u0394p = 0 kg m/s\n\nThe force (F) is equal to the impulse divided by the time (t):\n\nF = J / t = 0 kg m/s / 0.4 s = -2500 N\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the force is opposite to the direction of motion, which is consistent with the water exerting a force on the man to slow him down.\n\nThe correct option is therefore:\n\n(D) - 2500 N",
        "Let's break down the problem step by step!\n\n1. The airplane lands at a speed of 150 mi/hr, which is equal to 66.67 m/s (since 1 mile is approximately 1609.34 meters).\n2. The airplane is brought to a stop in 500 ft, which is equal to 152.4 meters.\n3. Since the acceleration is uniform, the final velocity (v) is 0 m/s, and the initial velocity (v0) is 66.67 m/s. We can use the equation:\n\nv = v0 + at\n\nwhere a is the acceleration and t is the time. Since v = 0, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n0 = 66.67 + at\n\n4. Rearrange the equation to solve for t:\n\nt = -66.67 / a\n\n5. To find the acceleration, we can use the equation:\n\ndistance = initial velocity x time + (1/2) x acceleration x time^2\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for acceleration:\n\na = (2 x distance) / time^2\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\na = (2 x 152.4) / (500/66.67)^2\na \u2248 -48.43 ft/s^2\n\n6.

        "I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nThe correct option is (F): \"It will fall with decreasing speed and decreasing acceleration.\"\n\nHere's why:\n\nIn free fall, the object experiences only two forces: gravity (which pulls it down) and drag (which opposes its motion). Since the drag force is proportional to the object's speed, it will slow down the object as it falls.\n\nAs the object falls, its speed will decrease due to the drag force, and its acceleration will also decrease because the force of gravity is being opposed by the increasing drag force. This means that the object's acceleration will decrease as its speed decreases.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (F): \"It will fall with decreasing speed and decreasing acceleration.\"",

        "I'd be happy to help!\n\nThe correct answer is (E): \"The vertical speed increases on the way up and decreases on the way down.\"\n\nHere's why:\n\n* When the projectile is launched at an angle of 45\u00b0 to the horizontal, it experiences an initial upward vertical acceleration due to gravity (g = 9.8 m/s\u00b2).\n* As the projectile rises, its vertical speed increases due to the upward acceleration.\n* At the top of the trajectory, the vertical speed is maximum, and the projectile momentarily comes to rest.\n* Then, the projectile begins to fall under the influence of gravity, and its vertical speed decreases as it accelerates downward.\n* As the projectile falls, its vertical speed decreases until it reaches its initial vertical speed, at which point it hits the ground.\n\nSo, option (E) correctly describes the motion of the projectile's vertical speed during its flight.",
        "I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nThe force between the balls is given as 50 \u03bcN. Since the charge of each ball remains the same, the force will still be proportional to the product of the charges. However, the mass of one of the balls has been doubled, which means the force will be proportional to the inverse of the square of the distance between the centers of the balls.\n\nSince the distance is small, the force will be proportional to the inverse of the square of the mass. Therefore, the force will be reduced by a factor of 4 (since the mass has been doubled).\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n(H): \"12.5 \u03bcN\"\n\nWait, no! The question asks for the new electric force between the balls, not the reduced force. Since the force is proportional to the product of the charges, it will remain the same.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n(H): \"50 \u03bcN\"\n\nThe force remains the same, 50 \u03bcN.",

To do this, we'll need to find the power output of the motor.\n\nPower output = Input power x Efficiency\n= (120V x 1.0A) x 0.75\n= 90 Watts\n\nSince the motor is lifting a 6 kg mass, we can assume that the force required to lift the mass is equal to the weight of the mass, which is:\n\nForce = mass x acceleration due to gravity\n= 6 kg x 9.8 m/s^2\n= 58.8 N\n\nTo find the speed at which the motor can lift the mass, we can use the formula:\n\nPower output = Force x Speed\n\nRearranging this formula to solve for speed, we get:\n\nSpeed = Power output / Force\n= 90 W / 58.8 N\n= approximately 1.53 m/s\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(B): \"1.5 m/s\"",
