Brady's 45-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss\n\nNow, let's add these together:\n\n8 + 4 + 45 = 57 yards\n\nSo, Tom Brady's touchdown passes combined for a total of 57 yards.",
        "To determine how many more touchdowns the Patriots scored than the Bills, let's first list the touchdowns scored by each team:\n\n**Bills:**\n- Marshawn Lynch's 8-yard TD run\n\nSo, the Bills scored 1 touchdown.\n\n**Patriots:**\n- Tom Brady's 8-yard TD pass to Benjamin Watson\n- Tom Brady's 3-yard TD pass to Randy Moss\n- Tom Brady's 4-yard TD pass to Jabar Gaffney\n- Sammy Morris' 4-yard TD run\n\nSo, the Patriots scored 4 touchdowns.\n\nNow, we calculate the difference:\n4 touchdowns (Patriots) - 1 touchdown (Bills) = 3 touchdowns\n\nThe Patriots scored 3 more touchdowns than the Bills.",

        "Navarre used the captivity of John II in 1363 to try to seize power, which was 9 years after the Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny was signed in 1360, where John II's ransom was set. Therefore, Navarre used the captivity of John II 9 years after the Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny.",
        "The passage does not state that any of John II's replacements were in captivity. John II himself was the one held captive in England. After John II's death in captivity in 1364, his son and successor, Charles V, became the king of France. Charles V was not mentioned as being in captivity in the given passage.",
        "The French crown had been at odds with Navarre since 1354. According to the passage, Charles V succeeded John II as king of France in 1364. Therefore, the French crown was at odds with Navarre for 10 years before Charles V became king.",
        "According to the passage, two inhabitants of Paris were held as hostages. It also states that \"several princes and nobles, including two of his sons,\" were held as hostages. Therefore, there were two sons of John II and two inhabitants of Paris who could be hostages held in lieu. \n\nSince the number of sons and inhabitants of Paris held as hostages is the same (both are two), the difference is zero. There were not more inhabitants of Paris than sons of John II who could be hostages held in lieu.",
        "According to the passage, two citizens from each of the nineteen principal towns of France could be held as hostages in lieu of John II.",
        "The French dispute with Navarre began in 1354, and the leverage of the captivity of John II occurred in 1363 when his son Louis of Anjou, a hostage in English-held Calais, escaped, prompting John II to return to captivity. Therefore, 9 years passed between the French dispute with Navarre and the use of John II's captivity as leverage.",
        "To determine how many years after John II returned to captivity he died, let's break down the timeline from the given passage:\n\n1. John II was held captive in England.\n2. The Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny set his ransom and allowed for hostages to be held in lieu of John.\n3. John returned to France to try and raise funds to pay the ransom.\n4. In 1362, John's son Louis of Anjou, a hostage in English-held Calais, escaped captivity.\n5. With his stand-in hostage gone, John felt honor-bound to return to captivity in England.\n6. John II died in London while still in honorable captivity in 1364.\n\nJohn returned to captivity in England to try and raise funds for his ransom, and he died in 1364. Since the passage does not explicitly state the exact year he returned, we can infer that he returned to captivity sometime before 1362, when his son Louis escaped.\n\nTherefore, John II died 2 years after he returned to captivity, as he died in 1364, and we can assume he returned sometime in 1362 or before.",
        "John II's son, Louis of Anjou, escaped captivity in English-held Calais in 1362. John II died in 1364. Therefore, John II died 2 years after his son was taken hostage in English-held Calais. However, it's important to note that the passage states Louis escaped in 1362, which implies he was taken hostage sometime before that year. Assuming the escape was immediate after being taken, it would still be 2 years from 1362 to 1364.",
        "The passage states that the French crown had been at odds with Navarre since 1354, and the Navarrese tried to seize power when John II was still in captivity in London in 1363. Therefore, the Dauphin (who would later become Charles V) tried to seize power 9 years after the conflict with Navarre began.",
        "According to the passage, hostages were held in lieu of John II, and these hostages were divided into two main groups:\n\n1. Two of John II's sons\n2. Several princes and nobles\n3. Four inhabitants of Paris\n4. Two citizens from each of the nineteen principal towns of France\n\nSo, in total, there were three groups: the sons, the princes and nobles, and the citizens from various towns.",
        "To determine how many years passed between the French being at odds with Navarre and the Navarrese attempting to seize power, we need to identify the relevant dates from the passage.\n\n1. The French crown had been at odds with Navarre since 1354.\n2. In 1363, the Navarrese used the captivity of John II in London and the political weakness of the Dauphin to try to seize power.\n\nThe period we are interested in is from 1354 to 1363.\n\nTo calculate the number of years:\n\\[ 1363 - 1354 = 9 \\]\n\nSo, 9 years passed between the French being at odds with Navarre and the Navarrese attempting to seize power.",
        "Yes, John II was in captivity when he died. According to the passage, John II was held captive in England and died in London while still in \"honourable captivity\" in 1364.",
        "John II was king first. The passage states that John II was held captive in England and that Charles V succeeded him as king of France. It also mentions that Charles V was crowned as the new king after John II's death in 1364.",
        "The Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny happened first. The Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny was signed in 1360, setting the terms for the release of King John II of France from captivity in England, including the ransom amount and the holding of hostages. The Battle of Cocherel took place on 7 May 1364, which is mentioned later in the passage and occurred after John II's death in 1364.",
        "According to the passage, at least 25 people were held hostage in place of John II. Specifically, the passage states that the hostages included \"two of his sons, several princes and nobles, four inhabitants of Paris, and two citizens from each of the nineteen principal towns of France.\" Adding two citizens from each of the nineteen towns gives us 38 citizens, plus the two sons, princes, and nobles, results in at least 25 people being held hostage.",
        "John II died in London in 1364 while still in captivity, which means he lived for 2 years after returning to captivity in England in 1362.",
        "To find out how many more people there were than families, you need to subtract the number of families from the total number of people.\n\nFrom the passage:\n- The total number of people: 218,590\n- The number of families: 60,387\n\nNow, subtract the number of families from the total number of people:\n\n218,590 - 60,387 = 158,203\n\nSo, there were 158,203 more people than families.",

Initially, voluntary enlistment was not meeting the targets, with only 73,000 volunteers out of an initial goal of 1 million in the first six weeks. To address this shortfall, the administration decided to rely primarily on conscription.

To find out how many years after the burning of Ryazan the Battle of Molodi occurred, we subtract the year 1564 from 1572:\n\n1572 - 1564 = 8\n\nTherefore, the Battle of Molodi occurred 8 years after the burning of Ryazan.",
