Since the yellow block is currently on the table and clear, you can pick it up by executing the \"Pick up a block\" action with the yellow block as the object.\n3. After picking up the yellow block, the hand is now holding the yellow block.\n4. Since the orange block is clear and the blue block is on top of it, you can unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block by executing the \"Unstack a block\" action with the blue block as the object and the orange block as the base.\n5. After unstacking the blue block, the orange block is now clear and available for stacking.\n6. Since the hand is still holding the yellow block, you can stack the yellow block on top of the red block by executing the \"Stack a block on top of another block\" action with the yellow block as the object and the red block as the base.\n7. After stacking the yellow block on top of the red block, the red block is now on top of the orange block, which is the desired state.\n8. Since the yellow block was put down during the sequence, the hand is now empty.\n\nTherefore, the plan to achieve the goal is to pick up the yellow block, unstack the blue block from the orange block, and stack the yellow block on top of the red block.",
        "To achieve the goal in the given problem, follow the plan below:\n\n1. Since the hand is empty, we cannot pick up the yellow block directly. We need to unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block first.\n\n2. Unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block.\n3. The hand is now empty, so we can pick up the yellow block.\n4. Pick up the yellow block.\n5. Since the blue block is clear, we can stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n6. Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n7. The hand is now empty, so we can put down the orange block.\n8. Put down the orange block (on the table).\n9. Since the red block is clear, we can stack the orange block on top of the red block.\n10. Stack the orange block on top of the red block.\n11. The hand is now empty, so we can put down the blue block.\n12. Put down the blue block (on the table).\n\nThe resulting state after following the plan will be:\n- The blue block is on the table.\n- The orange block is on top of the red block.\n- The red block is on top of the yellow block.\n- The yellow block is clear and is not being held.\n- The hand is empty.\n\nSo the goal of having the blue block on the table, the orange block on top of the red block, and the red block on top of the yellow block has been achieved.",
        "To achieve the goal in the given problem, follow these steps:\n\n1. Unstack the red block from on top of the orange block and put it down. (The red block is now clear and on the table.)\n2. Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block and put it down. (The orange block is now clear and on the table.)\n3. Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block and put it down. (The blue block is now clear and on the table. The yellow block is also clear since it was not mentioned as being on top of any other block.)\n4. Pick up the blue block.\n5. Stack the blue block on top of the orange block. (The orange block is clear, so it is now possible to stack the blue block on top of it.)\n6. Pick up the yellow block.\n7. Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block. (The blue block is clear and on the table, so it is now possible to stack the yellow block on top of it.)\n\nThe resulting state after following this plan will be:\n\n[RESULTING STATE]\nThe blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is on top of the blue block, the red block is on the table, and the hand is empty.",
        "Based on the initial conditions and the action sequence provided, the resulting state would be:\n\n[RESULTING STATE]\nThe hand is empty, the blue block is on the table next to the yellow block, and the orange block is on top of the red block with the red block on the table.\n\nTo achieve the goal of stacking the blue block on top of the red block, follow these steps:\n\n1. If the hand is not empty, first put down the block that is being held.\n2. Pick up the red block (since it is clear and on the table).\n3. Stack the orange block on top of the red block (since the hand is holding the red block and the orange block is clear).\n4. Pick up the blue block (since it is clear and on the table).\n5. Stack the blue block on top of the orange block (since the hand is holding the blue block and the orange block is clear and has a block on top of it).\n\nTherefore, the plan to achieve the goal is:\n\n1. If hand is not empty, put down the block in hand\n2. Pick up red block\n3. Stack orange block on top of red block\n4. Pick up blue block\n5. Stack blue block on top of orange block\n\nThis plan ensures that all the given restrictions are followed, and the goal of stacking the blue block on top of the red block is achieved.",
        "To achieve the goal, you need to stack the blue block on top of the orange block. Here is a plan for achieving that:\n\n1. Ensure the hand is empty before starting any action. (Since the hand is empty initially, no action is required for this step.)\n2. Unstack the orange block from on top of the red block. (This action is already executed in the given action sequence.)\n3. Put down the orange block. (Since the orange block is already put down in the resulting state, no action is required for this step.)\n4. Pick up the blue block. (This action is already executed in the given action sequence.)\n5. Stack the blue block on top of the orange block. (This action cannot be executed directly from the current state since the orange block is not clear. To make the orange block clear, you need to unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block and put it down.)\n6. Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block.\n7. Put down the yellow block.\n8. Stack the blue block on top of the orange block.\n\nThe final state after executing this plan will be: the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the red block is on the table, and the blue block and orange block are on the table."
