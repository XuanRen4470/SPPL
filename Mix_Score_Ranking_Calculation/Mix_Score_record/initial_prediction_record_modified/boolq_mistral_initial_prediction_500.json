        "No, Iranian Persian (Farsi) and Afghan Persian (Dari) are dialects of the same language, but they have some distinctions in vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar. While they are mutually intelligible to a significant degree, there may be challenges for non-native speakers in understanding each other perfectly. This is similar to the relationship between American English and British English, which are also considered separate dialects of the same language.",
        "Yes, Good Samaritan laws protect individuals who provide assistance to those in need, such as at the scene of an accident. The laws aim to reduce the fear of legal repercussions for bystanders who may make mistakes while attempting to help, thus encouraging more people to offer aid in emergency situations.",

        "No, Elder Scrolls Online is not the same game as Skyrim. They are both part of the Elder Scrolls series and share some similarities in terms of setting and gameplay mechanics, but they are distinct games with their own unique stories and features. Elder Scrolls Online is an MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) set a millennium before the events of Skyrim, with a focus on online multiplayer and a larger world to explore.

However, no official announcement has been made regarding a miniseries, so it is uncertain if and when such a project might materialize.",
        "No, the federal court is not the same as the Supreme Court. The federal court system is composed of various courts, including the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is the highest court in the federal judiciary and hears appeals from decisions of lower federal courts and, in some cases, state supreme courts. The other courts in the federal system, such as district courts and circuit courts of appeals, are below the Supreme Court in the hierarchy of the federal judiciary.",
        "No, Abraham Lincoln did not write the letter in Saving Private Ryan. The Bixby letter is a fictional letter in the film, and it was not written by Abraham Lincoln. The letter was actually written by Captain John Buel, Adjutant General of the State of Massachusetts, in response to a request from a grieving mother during the American Civil War. The letter in the film is a dramatization of the Bixby letter, with General George Marshall (played by Harve Presnell) reading it to his officers as a way to emphasize the human cost of war and the importance of saving Private Ryan to return one last surviving brother to his mother.",
        "Yes, Batman & Robin is a sequel to Batman Forever. It was produced and released quickly after the success of Batman Forever, with Joel Schumacher and Akiva Goldsman returning as director and writer, respectively.

Portions of Mr. Freeze's back-story were also inspired by the Batman: The Animated Series episode \"Heart of Ice.\"",
        "No, a wolverine is not the same as a badger. Wolverines belong to the same family, Mustelidae, as badgers, but they are in a different subfamily called Guloninae. Wolverines are larger, more powerful animals than badgers, and they have distinct physical features, such as short legs, a stocky build, and a distinctive head shape with a short, flat face and small ears. Badgers, on the other hand, have shorter legs, a more rounded face, and a more stocky build. While both animals are omnivores, their diets and habits differ significantly.",
        "Based on the information provided, there are currently no plans for a Green Lantern 2 movie.

Warner Bros. has instead opted to reboot the character in the DC Extended Universe with the film Green Lantern Corps, which is set for release in 2020.",
        "No, the International Criminal Court (ICC) does not have jurisdiction in the United States without its consent. The ICC is an international treaty-based court, and the United States has not ratified the Rome Statute, which established the ICC. Therefore, the ICC does not have the authority to investigate or prosecute crimes committed within the United States or by American citizens unless they are also nationals of a state party to the Rome Statute and the crimes were committed on the territory of that state. The United States has expressed concerns about the potential jurisdiction of the ICC over its citizens and has not submitted the Rome Statute to the Senate for ratification.",
        "Yes, that's correct. Calcium carbide (CaC\\_, also known as calcium carbide monohydrate or CaC\\_,2) is used as a raw material in the industrial production of acetylene gas. When calcium carbide is heated, it reacts with water to produce acetylene and calcium hydroxide. This reaction is known as the Calcium Carbide Process or the Le Chatelier process. Acetylene is then used as a fuel in oxy-acetylene torches for welding and cutting applications.",

        "No, a penalty shoot-out goal does not count towards individual records or \"golden boot\" competitions. This is because, for statistical purposes, a penalty shoot-out is considered to be a separate event from the main match and the scores are not included in the regular match statistics.",
        "As of now, there has been no official announcement from the Food Network regarding a new season of Cutthroat Kitchen.

        "Yes, in J.R.R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\" and the broader Middle-earth legendarium, Elves and Humans can mate and produce offspring called Half-elves or Peredhil. These Half-elves are significant characters in Tolkien's stories, such as Arwen Und\u00f3miel and Aragorn, who are the children of Elves and Humans.",
        "Yes, The Boy in the Plastic Bubble is based on true stories of individuals who lacked effective immune systems, specifically David Vetter and Ted DeVita. However, it is important to note that the film is a dramatization and not a biographical account of their lives in its entirety. The characters and some events in the film may be fictionalized for the purpose of telling a compelling story.",
        "In the context provided, the first kind of knowledge or argument can be referred to as \"empirical\" or \"inductive,\" as it is based on sense observation and experience. The second kind can be referred to as \"a priori\" or \"deductive,\" as it is derived from necessary premises that do not depend on sense experience.\n\nWith this in mind, the statement \"science begins with the premise that knowledge should first be acquired through observation\" can be seen as describing the empirical approach to knowledge acquisition in science. This means that scientific knowledge is built upon observations and experiences, and theories are developed to explain and make sense of the data obtained through observation.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this does not mean that all scientific knowledge is purely empirical, as there are also a priori principles and theories that play a role in scientific inquiry. For example, mathematical principles are often used to describe and explain natural phenomena, and these principles are considered to be a priori, as they are not derived from sense experience but rather from logical reasoning.\n\nTherefore, while the empirical approach is a crucial aspect of scientific inquiry, it is not the only approach, and there is also a role for a priori reasoning in science.",
        "Yes, Tim Brown is in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was inducted in 2015.",
        "Yes, you can drink alcohol in public in Denmark, as long as you do not disturb the peace or order.

However, based on the information provided in the context, it has only happened twice in the history of the World Cup finals (in 1994 and 2006). Therefore, it is not a common occurrence.",
        "No, Kingdom manga is not based on a true story. It is a work of fiction created by Yasuhisa Hara. While the story is set in China during the Warring States period, the events and characters are not based on real historical figures or events.",

        "Yes, according to French law, it is possible to enter into a posthumous marriage, also known as necrogamy, where one of the parties involved is deceased. However, it is important to note that there are specific requirements and conditions that must be met for such a marriage to be valid. These may include obtaining permission from the deceased person's next of kin or obtaining a court order, among other things. It is recommended to consult with a legal professional or the French embassy or consulate for more detailed information.",
        "While saline and sodium chloride are related, they are not exactly the same thing. Sodium chloride is the main active ingredient in saline solution. Saline solution is a liquid made by dissolving sodium chloride in water. So, all saline solutions contain sodium chloride, but not all sodium chloride is in the form of saline solution.",
        "Yes, there are effective treatments for bubonic plague. Several classes of antibiotics are commonly used to treat the disease, including aminoglycosides such as streptomycin and gentamicin, tetracyclines (especially doxycycline), and the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. These antibiotics can help reduce the mortality rate associated with the disease. Untreated cases of bubonic plague have a mortality rate of 40-60%, while treated cases have a mortality rate of about 1-15%. It's important to note that prompt diagnosis and timely administration of antibiotics are crucial for effective treatment.",
        "Yes, Buffy's mother, Joyce, eventually becomes aware that her daughter is the Slayer, a young woman with superhuman powers endowed by mystical forces to fight and defeat vampires, demons, and other evil forces. This revelation occurs at the end of the second season of the television series. Despite her initial shock, Joyce remains a source of stability and support for Buffy and her friends, eventually taking Buffy's dangerous demon-fighting in stride and even becoming proud and respectful of her daughter's abilities. However, Joyce passes away from an illness in the fifth season, forcing Buffy to face the challenges of adulthood without her mother's guidance.",
        "Yes, the Leaning Tower of Pisa was built leaning due to an inadequate foundation on ground that was too soft on one side. The tilt began during construction in the 12th century and gradually increased until it was stabilized in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.",
        "No, Fool's Gold is not a true story. It is a work of fiction created for the 2008 film of the same name. The storyline about a divorced couple searching for a lost treasure is not based on real events.",
        "No NFL team has yet played the Super Bowl at home, as the home field curse refers to the fact that no Super Bowl has been held in a team's home stadium. The teams mentioned in the context have qualified for the playoffs, but not the Super Bowl itself, at their home venues.",
        "Yes, that is correct. Each Australian state does have its own constitution. These state constitutions were established before the Constitution of Australia in 1901, when the states came together to form the Commonwealth of Australia. While the state constitutions do cede certain powers to the Parliament of Australia, they still provide the legal framework for the governance of each individual state.",
        "Yes, an individual can have both a right bundle branch block (RBBB) and a left bundle branch block (LBBB) simultaneously. This condition is referred to as a bifascicular block or a double bundle branch block. In such a case, both the right and left bundles of the His-Purkinje system are affected, leading to various degrees of heart conduction abnormalities. The clinical manifestations and ECG findings depend on the extent of involvement of each bundle. However, the most severe consequence of having both RBBB and LBBB is the increased risk of total AV block (complete heart block), which can lead to serious cardiac symptoms and even sudden cardiac death.",
        "No, you do not always have to say \"check\" in chess, especially in formal competitions. While announcing \"check\" is a common practice in informal games to make sure all players are aware of the potential threat to the opponent's king, it is not required in formal competitions. However, it is still a good habit to announce \"check\" to ensure clarity and prevent potential misunderstandings.",
        "No, an Australian Shepherd and an Australian Cattle Dog are not the same breed. They are two distinct breeds that share some similarities in appearance and origin, but they have different breed standards, temperaments, and uses. The Australian Shepherd is a herding breed known for its agility and intelligence, while the Australian Cattle Dog is a working breed known for its energy and strong herding instincts. The Texas Heeler is a crossbreed of these two breeds.",
        "No, tomato puree and tomato sauce are not the same thing. Tomato puree has a thicker consistency and a deeper flavor compared to tomato sauce.

        "Yes, in \"Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace,\" Padm\u00e9 Amidala is portrayed as the Queen of Naboo. Despite her young age, Natalie Portman's performances in films like \"The Professional\" and \"Beautiful Girls\" convinced George Lucas that she could believably embody the role of a strong and vulnerable queen.",
        "Yes, The Lord of the Rings is considered an epic novel. An epic is a long narrative poem, or a story in prose, that typically features larger-than-life heroes, grand themes, and epic battles. The Lord of the Rings fits this definition well, with its intricate storyline, richly developed characters, and grand scale. Additionally, the novel explores themes such as good versus evil, the corrupting influence of power, and the importance of friendship and loyalty, which are also common in epic literature.",
        "Yes, in English, the euro sign goes before the number. For example, \u20ac10, not 10 \u20ac.

        "Yes, stainless steel can be used on an induction cooktop as long as it contains a sufficient amount of ferrous material for the magnetic field to effectively generate heat. Not all stainless steels are suitable for induction cooking, but most 18/10 or 18/8 stainless steel pots and pans with a magnetic base should work fine on an induction cooktop. If you're unsure about a specific stainless steel cooking vessel, you can check for a magnet's ability to stick to the bottom of the pot or pan as a simple test. If the magnet sticks, the pot or pan is likely induction-compatible.",
        "While the terms \"job termination\" and \"being fired\" are related, they are not exactly the same. \"Job termination\" is a broader term that encompasses any end to an employment relationship, whether it be voluntary (such as resignation) or involuntary (such as being fired). \"Being fired,\" on the other hand, specifically refers to an involuntary termination initiated by the employer. So, all firings are terminations, but not all terminations are firings.",
        "Yes, according to the 2015 study by Cary Stothart, Walter Boot, and Daniel Simons, age does influence attentional ability and inattentional blindness. The study found that older adults are more susceptible to inattentional blindness than younger adults. Specifically, every 10 years of age was associated with a 1.3 fold increase in the probability of displaying inattentional blindness. This replicates the finding from previous studies by Graham and Burke (2011) and Most and colleagues (2000). However, the study also found that the relationship between age and inattentional blindness does not change as a function of the unexpected object's distance from the focus of attention, suggesting that useful field of view does not mediate the relationship between age and inattentional blindness.",
        "No, Sanskrit is not the first language of the world. The concept of a \"first language\" is not applicable, as languages have evolved from common ancestral languages over the course of thousands of years. Sanskrit, along with other Indo-European languages such as Greek, Latin, and Germanic languages, shares a common ancestor called Proto-Indo-European. However, the exact origins and timeline of the evolution of Proto-Indo-European and its descendant languages are still subjects of ongoing research in linguistics and archaeology.",
        "Yes, a Jack Russell Terrier is considered a small breed of dog. Despite its name, which might suggest a larger size due to its association with the Jack, a type of hunting dog, Jack Russell Terriers are actually a small terrier breed.",

For example, fighter escorts were provided to Air Force One following the September 11 attacks.",
        "It depends on the specific AR-15 you are referring to and its features. The Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989 and California's 2000 Assault Weapons ban prohibited certain versions of AR-15s based on their specific design characteristics, such as detachable magazines and certain pistol grips. However, there are exemptions and grandfathering provisions for certain pre-ban AR-15s.\n\nTo determine if it is legal to own an AR-15 in California, you would need to consult the California Department of Justice's list of approved assault weapons, which includes a searchable database of specific firearms that are legal or illegal to own in the state based on their features. If the AR-15 you are interested in is not on this list, it may be illegal to own in California without going through the process of registering it as an assault weapon with the California Department of Justice.\n\nIt is important to note that California law also requires that all firearms be registered with the local law enforcement agency where the owner resides. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in criminal charges and the seizure of the firearm.\n\nIt is recommended that you consult with a qualified firearms lawyer or the California Department of Justice for specific guidance on the legality of owning an AR-15 in California.",
        "Yes, the national anthem of the United States is called \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" The poem that became the lyrics of the national anthem was originally titled \"Defence of Fort M'Henry\" and was written by Francis Scott Key after witnessing the U.S. flag, known as the Star-Spangled Banner, still flying above Fort McHenry following the U.S. victory in the Battle of Baltimore during the War of 1812. Therefore, the national anthem and the Star-Spangled Banner are the same thing.",

        "Yes, homologous chromosomes carry the same genes for a given trait, but they may carry different versions or alleles of those genes. During meiosis, these homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange genetic material through a process called crossing over, which can result in the creation of new combinations of alleles for the same trait. These new combinations are then passed on to the offspring through the formation of gametes (sperm or eggs).",
        "Yes, Michigan has won 11 national championships in football as per their claims. The most recent one was in 1997, as recognized by the Associated Press (AP) Poll.

        "Yes, according to the Waiter Rule, the way a person treats their waiter or other service staff can provide insight into their true character. This rule suggests that if someone is kind and respectful to the waiter, they are likely to be nice people. Conversely, if someone is rude or disrespectful to the waiter, it may indicate that they have a less desirable personality trait. However, it's important to remember that this rule is not a definitive measure of someone's character, and there may be exceptions to this observation.",
        "Yes, there is one species of crocodile that is native to North America, and that is the American crocodile. However, their distribution is primarily limited to the southernmost tip of Florida in the United States, with a few documented cases in the Tampa Bay area. The American crocodile population in the US has seen a significant recovery from a few hundred in the 1970s to an estimated 2,000 currently. So, while there are crocodiles native to North America, their range is quite limited.",
        "Yes, Lex Luthor discovers Superman's identity in \"Smallville.\" After realizing that the symbols he had been encountering were connected to the secret organization Veritas, he learns that an alien visitor named \"The Traveler\" would arrive in Smallville during a meteor shower in 1989.

When he brings the orb to the Fortress of Solitude, he is confronted by Clark Kent (Superman) and uses the orb to bring down the Fortress around them both. This event marks Lex's final discovery of Clark's secret identity.",
        "To take the bar exam in most jurisdictions in the United States, you are required to have earned a Juris Doctor degree from an approved law school before applying to take the exam.

        "Yes, there are several countries outside of North America, Europe, and Oceania that observe daylight saving time. Some countries in South America, such as Chile and Argentina, observe DST. In Asia, countries like China, India, Malaysia, and Thailand have implemented DST in certain regions or cities. In Africa, some countries like Egypt, Morocco, and Algeria observe DST. In the Middle East, Israel and Iran also observe DST. It's important to note that the specific regions or areas within these countries that observe DST can vary, so it's always a good idea to check the local laws and customs if you're planning to travel to a specific area.",
        "Yes, John Samuel Vander Meer is the only pitcher in Major League Baseball history to throw two consecutive no-hitters. He accomplished this feat on July 1, 1938, against the Boston Bees (now the Atlanta Braves) and on July 15, 1938, against the Brooklyn Dodgers.",

However, there are types of glass that are more resistant to breaking than standard glass, such as tempered glass and laminated glass. These types of glass can withstand greater force before shattering, but they are not absolutely unbreakable.",
        "Yes, liquid latex can be used as an adhesive due to its tackiness when it is dry. It can be used to attach things to the latex, such as zippers. However, it's important to note that the effectiveness of using liquid latex as an adhesive may depend on the specific application and the materials being bonded together. In some cases, other adhesives may be more suitable for certain bonding applications.",
        "No, it is not illegal for a Texas resident to carry a pistol in their car as long as they meet certain qualifications. These qualifications include: the weapon must not be in plain sight, the carrier cannot be involved in criminal activities other than Class C traffic misdemeanors, the carrier cannot be prohibited by state or federal law from possessing a firearm, and the carrier cannot be a member of a criminal gang. The bill, H.B. 1815, revised Chapter 46, Section 2 of the Penal Code to state that carrying a handgun in a motor vehicle is not considered \"Unlawful Carry of a Weapon\" under Texas law.",
        "Yes, it is legal to carry a sgian-dubh in Scotland, England, and Wales when it is being worn as part of the national Scottish dress. The specific laws you mentioned in the context allow for this exception. However, it's important to note that there may be other restrictions or conditions regarding the carrying of such a knife, so it's always a good idea to check local regulations or consult with law enforcement for the most accurate information.",
        "Yes, the hypoglossal nerve is the primary cranial nerve responsible for innervating the muscles of the tongue. However, as mentioned in the context, there is another cranial nerve, the vagus nerve, which innervates one specific muscle of the tongue, the palatoglossus. The tongue also receives sensory innervation from other cranial nerves, such as the trigeminal nerve and the glossopharyngeal nerve.",
        "Yes, Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States. While it is not a state, it is governed by the U.S. Congress and the President of the United States.

        "Yes, there have been several players who have scored 6 goals in a single football game. Archie Thompson and David Zdrilic's 13 and 8-goal performances against American Samoa in 2002 are not the only high-scoring games in football history. Here are a few examples of players who scored 6 goals in a single game:\n\n1. Ferenc Puskas (Hungary) \u2013 scored 6 goals against South Korea in a 1952 Olympic qualifier.\n2.

        "No, puppies do not see well right when their eyes open. Their eyes may be open, but their vision is still developing and their retinas are poorly developed. Puppies rely more on their sense of smell during the first few weeks of life to navigate and find their mother's teats and littermates.",
        "No, the Sears Tower and the John Hancock Center are two different buildings in Chicago. The Sears Tower, now known as the Willis Tower, is the tallest building in the city and was completed in 1974. The John Hancock Center, completed in 1969, is the fourth-tallest building in Chicago and is located at 875 North Michigan Avenue.",
        "Yes, Tokyo Ghoul:re is a sequel to Tokyo Ghoul. The story picks up after the events of the original series and continues to explore the world of Tokyo Ghoul and its characters.",
        "Yes, Texas State Troopers are required to wear hats as part of their uniform. However, the type of hat worn depends on the weather conditions and the specific uniform being worn. In colder weather, felt hats are worn, while straw hats are worn in warmer weather. Dress uniforms, which include a blue tie, long-sleeved shirt, and black cowboy boots, also require the wearing of a cowboy hat. For ceremonial units, additional items such as white gloves, a white ascot, a black Sam Browne shoulder strap, and a red shoulder cord are added to the uniform.",
        "Based on the information provided in the context, vaping is not outright illegal if you are under 18, but there are regulations in place that make it harder for minors to access e-cigarettes. The FDA's ruling requires a photo ID to buy e-cigarettes, and their sale in all-ages vending machines is not permitted. Additionally, the FDA has sent warning letters to retailers, including online retailers, for unlawful underage sales. So, while it's not illegal for minors to vape, it is illegal for them to purchase e-cigarettes or have them sold to them in certain ways.",
        "No, wheat flour and white flour are not the same thing. Wheat flour is made from the entire wheat grain, but in the case of white flour, only the endosperm part of the wheat grain is used. The germ and bran, which contain fiber, vitamins, and minerals, are removed during the milling process to produce white flour.",
        "Yes, in the novel and film \"Stand By Me\" by Stephen King, the boys do find a body after a series of adventures and self-revelations.

When Chris refuses to allow this, a confrontation ensues and Ace threatens to kill Chris. Gordie intervenes with a pistol, and Ace and his gang leave, vowing revenge.",
        "No, the English did not win the Hundred Years War. Despite their overwhelming victories at Cr\u00e9cy, Poitiers, and Agincourt, they were unable to completely conquer France due to the greater resources of the French monarchy. French victories at Orl\u00e9ans, Patay, Formigny, and Castillon in the late 15th century marked the end of the war and resulted in England permanently losing most of its possessions on the continent.",
        "Yes, Ferguson Jenkins is in the Baseball Hall of Fame. He was the first Canadian to be inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1991.",
        "No, Family Dollar and Dollar General are not the same company. While they are both discount retailers, they operate as separate businesses.

        "Yes, Station 19 is a spin-off of Grey's Anatomy. Both shows are created by Stacy McKee and produced by Shondaland and ABC Studios. Station 19 focuses on the lives of the firefighters at Seattle Fire Station 19, while Grey's Anatomy revolves around the doctors at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. The two shows share some crossover characters and storylines.",
        "Yes, tomatoes are a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). Tomatoes belong to the genus Solanum, which is one of the most well-known genera in the family. The nightshade family is known for its economically important crops, and tomatoes are certainly one of them. Other well-known members of the Solanaceae family include potatoes, eggplants, bell and chili peppers, and tobacco.",
        "No, Dollar Tree and Dollar General are not the same company. They are two separate businesses in the discount retail industry. Dollar General went public again in 2009, while Dollar Tree has been a publicly traded corporation for a longer time. Although they share similar names and business models, they operate as independent entities. The competition between the two companies became more intense in 2014 when Dollar General made a bid to acquire Family Dollar, which was then owned by Dollar Tree. However, the bid was ultimately rejected by the Family Dollar board.",
        "Yes, the Cat in the Hat is named as such in the Dr. Seuss book of the same name. However, it is notable that the Cat is often referred to by this title rather than a specific name throughout the story.",
        "Yes, the movie \"Rudy\" is based on the true story of Daniel \"Rudy\" Ruettiger, who attended the University of Notre Dame and played college football there despite facing numerous challenges and setbacks. The film tells the inspiring story of Rudy's determination and perseverance to achieve his dream of playing for the Notre Dame football team.",
        "The movie \"The Wall,\" which was bought by Amazon Studios based on Dwain Worrell's original spec script, is a work of fiction. While Worrell drew inspiration from real-life experiences and situations, the script is not based on a true story. It is a product of Worrell's imagination and should be considered a work of fiction.",
        "In New York City, the rules for carrying a gun are stricter than in the rest of the state. New York City has its own firearms laws that are in addition to the New York State laws. Generally, it is very difficult for individuals to obtain permits to carry concealed weapons in New York City. The city has a \"may issue\" policy for concealed carry permits, which means that the decision to issue a permit is up to the discretion of the issuing authority. It is not a given right.\n\nThe NY SAFE Act also applies to New York City, so owning, carrying, or possessing an assault weapon is generally prohibited. It is recommended that you consult with a firearms attorney or law enforcement agency in New York City for the most accurate and up-to-date information on the city's specific firearms laws.",
        "Yes, that is correct. The former Soviet Union, also known as the USSR, broke up into 15 separate states in 1991. These states are collectively referred to as the post-Soviet states or the former Soviet Republics. Russia became the internationally recognized successor state to the Soviet Union after the Cold War. The three Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, were the first to declare their independence in 1990, and the remaining 12 states formed the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and most of them also joined the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). The Baltic states focused on joining the European Union and NATO instead.",
        "Yes, hot and sour soup generally has a high sodium content due to the use of broth, vinegar, and the addition of cornstarch, which can increase the sodium level when used in large quantities. However, it is still considered a relatively healthy option in Chinese cuisine due to the inclusion of various vegetables and fungi, which provide nutrients and fiber. As with any dish, it's important to consume hot and sour soup in moderation and be mindful of your overall sodium intake.",
        "Yes, a person can sink in a corn silo if they fall into the grain. Corn is denser than water, so a person who falls into a corn silo can find themselves sinking into the grain rather than staying afloat. This can make it difficult for them to escape on their own, increasing the risk of entrapment or engulfment. It's important for workers in grain handling facilities to take appropriate safety precautions to prevent accidents and to seek help immediately if someone does fall into a grain bin.",
        "Yes, that's correct. The corticospinal tracts are neural pathways that connect the cerebral cortex to the spinal cord. They play a crucial role in the control of voluntary movements and are primarily composed of large pyramidal neurons, or Betz cells, which are not found in any other region of the body. The majority of the fibers in the corticospinal tracts cross over in the medulla oblongata, meaning that muscles are typically controlled by the opposite side of the brain.",
        "Yes, in Australian Rules Football (AFL), a player must bounce the ball when they are in possession and running with it. This rule is implemented to ensure that the game remains open and flowing, as it prevents players from holding the ball for too long and allows other players to try to gain possession. However, there are some exceptions to this rule, such as when a player is in their defensive 50-meter penalty area or when they are taking a mark or a free kick.",
        "No, a denatured protein cannot function because it has lost its three-dimensional structure. The denaturation process disrupts the protein's native conformation, which is essential for its specific biological role within the cell. Denatured proteins may exhibit various characteristics, such as conformational change, loss of solubility, and aggregation, but they cannot perform their normal functions in the cell.",
        "No, The Mountain Between Us is not based on a real story. It is a work of fiction, based on the 2011 novel of the same name by Charles Martin.",
        "Yes, generally speaking, U.S. citizens and residents are required to pay Federal income taxes on their worldwide income. This includes income earned in the United States as well as income earned abroad. The petitioner's argument that the State of Illinois is not part of the United States and therefore he is not subject to Federal income tax on income earned in Illinois is not supported by any legal authorities. It is an absurd proposition that has been consistently rejected by the courts.",
        "Yes, the Marine Corps is a component of the U.S. Department of Defense and is part of the Navy Department, specifically the Department of the Navy. The Marine Corps operates under the oversight of the Secretary of the Navy and is responsible for organizing, recruiting, training, and equipping its forces.

        "Based on the information provided in the context, there is no indication that a UK general election will be held in 2018. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 sets out that the next scheduled election is on 5 May 2022, and an early election can only be called under certain circumstances, such as a two-thirds majority vote in the House of Commons for an early election motion or a vote of no confidence in the government that is not followed by a vote of confidence within 14 days. Neither of these circumstances have occurred as of now, so it is unlikely that an election will be held in 2018.",
        "Yes, Dexron III is generally backward-compatible with transmissions that use earlier Dexron II fluid. However, it is important to note that while Dexron III may be suitable for short-term use in a transmission designed for Dexron II, its long-term durability may not be as good as that of the original fluid. This is because Dexron III does not fully address the issues of shear stability and fluid oxidation that were identified in later models. If possible, it is recommended to use the specific fluid recommended by the vehicle manufacturer to ensure the best possible performance and longevity of the transmission.",
        "No, handguns are effectively banned in the UK with the exception of Northern Ireland, where they can be owned under strict licensing conditions. The ban was put in place after the Dunblane school massacre in 1996, which was the UK's first and only school shooting. Since then, there has been one spree killing involving a legally owned shotgun, but handguns remain restricted.",
        "Yes, according to the context provided, in the absence of a contractual provision restricting it, an employee in South Africa can hold two jobs as long as the second job does not interfere with the working hours of the first job. However, employers can include contractual provisions limiting moonlighting activities if they so choose.",
        "Yes, in the United States, long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income or short-term capital gains. The specific tax rate for long-term capital gains depends on the investor's tax bracket but is generally lower than the rates for ordinary income or short-term capital gains.",
        "Oregon does not have a stand-your-ground law in the same way that some other states do. Oregon law does not require a person to retreat before using force in self-defense, but it does place an affirmative duty on a person to attempt to withdraw from harm before using deadly force. This means that in Oregon, a person can use force, including deadly force, to defend themselves without retreating, but they have a duty to try to avoid the need to use force in the first place by attempting to retreat or otherwise avoid the danger. This is different from stand-your-ground laws in some other states, which do not require a person to retreat before using force in self-defense, even if they could safely do so.",
        "Yes, pumas, cougars, and mountain lions are all names for the same species of wild cat: Puma concolor. These names are used interchangeably to refer to the large felid native to the Americas, which is the second-heaviest cat in the New World.",
        "No, Popeye the Sailor Man is not a Disney character. Although he appeared in a planned cameo for the Disney/Touchstone film \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit,\" the legal complications related to the ownership of his rights prevented his inclusion in the final version of the film. Popeye is actually a character from the King Features Syndicate comic strip and has a complex history of being distributed by various media companies, including MGM/UA and Turner Entertainment.",

        "Yes, in New Jersey, you need a Firearm Purchaser Identification card (FID) to buy rifles and shotguns, and a separate permit from the Chief of Police or the Superintendent of State Police to buy a handgun. These permits are provided on a shall-issue basis after an application process that includes background checks and in-depth questioning. The FID card is a lifetime permit, while the handgun permit expires after 90 days but can be extended. Reasons for denial include criminal convictions, disorderly persons offenses, domestic violence, and being on the terror watchlist.",
        "Yes, it is legal to drink alcohol in public in London, England, as long as the container is not glass and you are not causing disorder, disturbance, or nuisance to others. It is also legal to consume alcohol on aeroplanes and most National Rail train services in the UK. However, it is always important to be mindful of local regulations and the behavior of others, as some areas may have specific restrictions or guidelines regarding public drinking.",
        "Yes, in the United States, with the exception of North Dakota, you must register to vote before you can participate in federal, state, and local elections. In North Dakota, while the state does not require registration for voting in state and federal elections, cities in the state may offer voter registration for city elections.",
        "No, chess pie and buttermilk pie are not the same. Both are custard-like pies that originated in the southern United States, but they have some key differences. Chess pie includes cornmeal in its filling, while buttermilk pie does not.

Anaphylaxis is a systemic allergic reaction that can affect multiple organ systems in the body, including the skin, respiratory system, cardiovascular system, and gastrointestinal system. While an itchy rash and swelling of the eyes are common symptoms, anaphylaxis can also cause throat or tongue swelling, shortness of breath, vomiting, lightheadedness, and low blood pressure.",
        "No, you do not need to fast for a random glucose test. This type of blood sugar test can be taken at any time of the day, regardless of when the person last ate. However, it's important to note that a random glucose test only provides a snapshot of a person's blood sugar level at that moment in time. For a more accurate diagnosis of diabetes or prediabetes, a healthcare professional may also perform a fasting blood glucose test or an oral glucose tolerance test.",
        "Based on the information provided, no, there will not be a season 4 of The Border. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) announced the cancellation of the show after three seasons.",
        "No, the standard Nissan Rogue comes with front-wheel-drive. However, Nissan does offer an all-wheel-drive (AWD) version of the Rogue as an option. If you're interested in the AWD Rogue, you may want to specify that when looking for more information or purchasing one.",

        "Yes, there is a difference between normal saline solution and Ringer's lactate solution, despite both being crystalloid solutions and having the same tonicity as blood.\n\nNormal saline solution is a sodium chloride solution, meaning it primarily contains sodium and chloride ions. Ringer's lactate solution, on the other hand, contains a balanced electrolyte solution, including sodium, chloride, potassium, calcium, and lactate ions.\n\nThe main differences between the two solutions are their composition and clinical applications. Normal saline is often used for volume expansion and for maintaining intravascular volume, but it can cause a higher rate of acidosis due to its high chloride content. Ringer's lactate solution, on the other hand, has a lower rate of acidosis and is preferred for maintaining electrolyte balance, especially in situations where significant fluid and electrolyte losses have occurred.\n\nIt is important to note that Ringer's lactate solution may not be suitable for mixing with certain medications and some recommend against its use in the same infusion as a blood transfusion. Additionally, Ringer's lactate solution may not be suitable for patients with certain conditions, such as high blood potassium or volume overload, and should be used with caution in pregnancy and breastfeeding.",
        "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a work of fiction. The novel, written by Ken Kesey, is based on his experiences working as a night supervisor at a mental institution in Oregon in the late 1950s. However, the characters and events in the novel are not based on real people or incidents but rather are products of Kesey's imagination. The play and film adaptations of the novel also follow the fictional narrative.",
        "Yes, fog machines use a fluid that is typically a mixture of water and a specialized additive, such as glycol or glycerin, to produce the fog effect. The additive helps the fog particles remain in the air longer and makes the fog denser and more visible. Without the additive, the water would simply turn into droplets and not form a visible fog.",
        "Yes, when Sandy hit New Jersey on October 29, it was no longer a tropical cyclone but had transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone. However, it still packed hurricane-force winds.",

        "Supreme Court judges do receive protection, but it is provided by the Supreme Court Police, not the U.S. Secret Service. The U.S. Secret Service is primarily responsible for protecting the President, the Vice President, and their families, as well as other individuals as designated by law. The protection of Supreme Court judges is a responsibility of the Supreme Court itself, and is carried out by the Supreme Court Police, who are authorized by law to ensure the safety and security of the Supreme Court building and its occupants.",
        "No, the movie \"Dunkirk\" was not directly based on a book. While the film was inspired by real historical events, the screenplay was original and written by Christopher Nolan himself.",
        "In the UK, a jury in a criminal trial is generally required to reach a unanimous verdict, meaning that all jurors must agree on the guilty or not guilty verdict. However, if the jury is unable to reach a unanimous decision after a significant amount of time, the judge may allow a majority verdict of at least ten to two. This means that ten jurors must agree on the guilty or not guilty verdict, while the remaining two jurors may dissent. However, the jury is still encouraged to continue trying to reach a unanimous decision if possible.",
        "While the National Guard is a component of the United States military under the Department of Defense, its boot camp or basic training is similar but not identical to that of the active duty Army. The National Guard's basic training may be held at various locations, including National Guard armories and military bases, and it may be conducted part-time, allowing trainees to maintain civilian employment and family responsibilities while they train. However, the physical and military training curriculum is similar to that of the active duty Army. Ultimately, the National Guard boot camp provides recruits with the essential skills and knowledge required for Army service.",
        "No, Cornus florida, the flowering dogwood, is not native to the Middle East. Its natural range is in eastern North America and northern Mexico.",
        "Yes, there is such a thing as a coywolf. It is a canid hybrid descended from coyotes and gray wolves. Both coyotes and gray wolves belong to the same genus, Canis, and have a chromosome number of 78, making it possible for them to interbreed. Genetic studies suggest that these two species diverged relatively recently, and that gray wolf populations in North America have some degree of admixture with coyotes, with the highest levels occurring in Ontario, Quebec, and Atlantic Canada.",
        "Yes, Dr. Martens are still made in the UK. The company produces a line of shoes and boots, known as the \"Vintage\" line, at the Cobbs Lane Factory in Wollaston, England. However, the majority of Dr. Martens products are still manufactured in Asia.",
        "Yes, hydrogen chloride is a gas at room temperature. The context states that it is a colorless gas at room temperature.",
        "Yes, it is possible to build an alcohol tolerance with regular drinking. The body adapts to the presence of alcohol by producing more of the enzymes responsible for breaking down alcohol in the liver. This results in a reduced sensitivity to alcohol and the need for larger quantities to achieve the same effects. However, it's important to note that alcohol tolerance can be a sign of alcohol dependency and may lead to more serious health consequences if not addressed.",
        "Yes, blue jays do take over the nests of other mid-sized songbirds if they find them in suitable locations. American robins are a common target for blue jays in this regard. The blue jays do not build their own nests in these instances, but instead use the abandoned or active nests of other birds.",
        "Yes, the Olympic torch is always lit in Greece as part of the official torch relay leading up to the Olympic Games. The lighting ceremony takes place at the Ancient Olympic Site in Olympia, Greece. This tradition dates back to the first modern Olympic Games in Athens, Greece, in 1896.",

It was released on June 27, 2018, and was directed by Karena Evans, who had previously worked with Drake on the videos for \"God's Plan,\" \"Nice for What,\" and \"I'm Upset.\" The music video for \"In My Feelings\" was shot in New Orleans on July 23, 2018.",
        "Yes, a goalkeeper can pick up the ball after it has been thrown-in by a teammate, as long as they do not handle the ball before it has touched another player or the ground. The back-pass rule only applies to balls that are deliberately kicked to the goalkeeper by a teammate or received directly from a teammate's throw-in. However, if the goalkeeper touches the ball before it has touched another player or the ground after a throw-in, it would be considered a handling offense and the opposing team would be awarded a direct free kick from the spot of the infringement.",
        "No, the Cecil Hotel is not currently open in Los Angeles. It is undergoing renovation and redevelopment into a mix of hotel rooms and residential units. The new name of the establishment is \"Stay on Main.\"",
        "A birth certificate alone is typically not considered a valid form of identification, as it does not contain any identifying features such as a photograph.

        "In a parallel circuit, each branch or line carries the same voltage as the others, but the currents through each branch can be different if the components connected to that branch have different resistances. Since the voltage is the same across each component in a parallel circuit, components with lower resistance will draw more current than components with higher resistance, as long as there is sufficient voltage and power available to supply the current demand. Therefore, individual parallel lines or branches in a parallel circuit can have different currents flowing through them.",
        "Yes, the orientation of a protein sequence is important for its function. The primary structure of a protein, which is the sequence of amino acids, determines the three-dimensional structure of the protein, including its folding and the location of active sites. Peptide cleavage, as mentioned in the context, is an important modification of primary structure that can activate proteins by removing inhibitory peptides and revealing the active site. However, the orientation of specific amino acids within the protein sequence can also play a role in the protein's function. For example, certain amino acids may be important for binding to other molecules or for interacting with cofactors, and their orientation can affect the efficiency and specificity of these interactions. Additionally, the orientation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues can influence the protein's stability and solubility in different environments. Overall, the primary structure of a protein, including its sequence and any modifications, determines its three-dimensional structure and function, and the orientation of specific residues within that structure can be crucial for its activity.",
        "Yes, DC's Legends of Tomorrow is based on the characters of DC Comics. The television series is set in the same fictional universe as Arrow and The Flash, which are also based on DC Comics characters. However, the specific storylines and plot of Legends of Tomorrow are original to the television series and not directly adapted from any particular comic book.",
        "Bok choy and pak choi are not exactly the same vegetable, but they are closely related and often used interchangeably. Both are types of Chinese cabbage, specifically chinensis varieties, but they can have slight differences in appearance and growth habits.\n\nBok choy (Brassica rapa subsp. chinensis 'Taasai') typically has a more elongated stem with large, round, white or pale green bulbs at the base, while the leaves are dark green and smooth. Pak choi (Brassica rapa subsp. chinensis 'Japanese' or 'Baby Pak Choi'), on the other hand, has a shorter stem with small, dark green leaves that form a loose rosette. The leaves of pak choi are often described as being more tender and delicate than those of bok choy.\n\nDespite these differences, they are both delicious and nutritious vegetables that are popular in Chinese and Asian cuisine. They can be used interchangeably in most recipes, so the choice between bok choy and pak choi often comes down to personal preference or availability.",

        "The visual cliff is a device used by psychologists to study depth perception in human and animal subjects. It is essentially a sheet of Plexiglas with a high-contrast checkerboard pattern on each side. One side has the patterned cloth immediately beneath the Plexiglas, while the other side has the cloth dropped several feet below. The visual cliff allows researchers to experimentally adjust the optical stimuli associated with a simulated cliff while protecting the subjects from injury. This setup helps investigate how infants and other species perceive depth and distinguish between visual and tactile information.",

        "Yes, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is a lower motor neuron disease. It is a neurological disorder characterized by the degeneration of the peripheral nerves, leading to muscle weakness and paralysis. In Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, the immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin sheath that protects the axons in the peripheral nerves, causing a disruption in the transmission of electrical signals from the nerves to the muscles. This results in the symptoms of muscle weakness and paralysis, which are typical of lower motor neuron injuries.",

        "No, the graviton is not part of the Standard Model. The Standard Model is a theory that describes the fundamental particles and forces in the universe, excluding gravity. Gravitons, if they exist, would be the quantum particles associated with the force of gravity, and they are not included in the Standard Model. However, there are ongoing efforts to extend the Standard Model by including gravity and the graviton, such as in the context of string theory.",
        "No, Saint David's Day is not currently a bank holiday in Wales. Despite strong support and numerous attempts to make it one, including a poll showing that the majority of people in Wales want it to be a bank holiday, it has not been officially recognized as such by the British government.",
        "No, the normal force and the force of gravity are not always equal. The normal force acts perpendicular to the surface of contact and opposes the force that presses an object against the surface. The force of gravity, on the other hand, acts vertically downwards and is equal to the mass of an object multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nAn object at rest on a level surface experiences an equal and opposite normal force to the force of gravity acting on it. However, when an object is in motion or on a sloped surface, the normal force and the force of gravity can be different. For example, when an object is pushed horizontally on a surface, the normal force still acts perpendicular to the surface, but the force of gravity continues to act vertically downwards. In this case, the normal force and the force of gravity are not equal.\n\nSimilarly, when an object is on a slope, the normal force is perpendicular to the surface and depends on the angle of the slope, while the force of gravity acts vertically downwards and is constant. In this situation, the normal force and the force of gravity are not equal, as the normal force is less than the force of gravity when the object is on an incline.",
        "Yes, the mail runs on Memorial Day, which is considered a \"Widely Observed\" holiday in the U.S. Mail services typically operate under adjusted schedules on holidays, so it's best to check with the USPS for specific delivery and pickup schedules during Memorial Day weekend.",

These notes are backed pound for pound by Bank of England notes, and their design is based on the old Series A notes.",
        "Yes, it is possible to get drunk by inhaling alcohol vapors. The alcohol is absorbed more quickly into the bloodstream through inhalation than through consumption by mouth because it bypasses the digestive system. However, it is important to note that inhaling alcohol vapors is dangerous and can have serious health consequences, including damage to the lungs and central nervous system. It is not recommended for recreational use and is primarily used for medical purposes in controlled environments.",
        "No, daylight saving time is not observed everywhere in the world. Some regions, such as most areas of Africa and Asia, do not practice daylight saving time.

        "While the sound produced when holding a shell to your ear can resemble the rushing sound of the ocean, it is not actually the sound of the ocean that you are hearing. Instead, the sound is the result of the surrounding environment resonating within the cavity of the shell. The similarity in sound between the shell and the ocean is due to the resemblance between ocean movements and airflow. Therefore, while the experience of holding a shell to your ear can evoke the sensation of being near the ocean, it is not a true representation of the ocean's sound.",
        "No, sweet Italian sausage is not the same as mild Italian sausage. Although both varieties have some similarities in their spice mixes, the main difference lies in the addition of specific herbs and spices. Sweet Italian sausage contains sweet basil, which gives it a distinct sweet flavor, while mild Italian sausage does not contain sweet basil. Instead, it may contain other herbs and spices to add flavor without the heat of hot Italian sausage or the sweetness of sweet Italian sausage.",

There are no post-nominal titles associated with the Medal of Honor, and the most common abbreviations for the decoration are \"MOH\" and \"MH\".",
        "The answer to this question depends on the specific policies and culture of your workplace. In some industries and workplaces, sleeping on the job may be considered a serious offense and could result in disciplinary action, including termination of employment. However, there is a growing movement in support of napping at work due to the potential health and productivity benefits. Some employers even provide facilities for employees to take naps during their workday.\n\nIf you accidentally fall asleep while on duty, it would be important to communicate openly with your employer about what happened and any steps you are taking to ensure it doesn't happen again. If you intentionally sleep on the job, the consequences could be more severe. Ultimately, it's best to check with your employer's policies and speak with your supervisor or HR representative for clarification.",

        "No, electrode potential and reduction potential are not exactly the same thing, but they are related. The electrode potential of an electrode measures the tendency of that electrode to lose or gain electrons in an electrochemical reaction, while the reduction potential specifically refers to the potential at which a reduction half-reaction occurs. The electrode potential can be calculated as the sum of the potentials of the individual half-reactions that make up the overall redox reaction. Since the oxidation potential of a half-reaction is the negative of the reduction potential, it is common to express standard electrode potentials as standard reduction potentials for convenience.",
        "Yes, North Korea did compete in the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

The use of mercury in syphilis treatment is first recorded in Europe with Giorgio Sommariva of Verona in 1496, although its use may date back to The Canon of Medicine by Ibn Sina in the 11th century if syphilis existed in the Old World prior to Columbus. The goal of mercury treatment was to cause the patient to salivate, which was thought to expel the disease, but it also had unpleasant side effects such as gum ulcers and loose teeth. Mercury continued to be used in syphilis treatment for centuries, including by injection as discussed in an 1869 article by TJ Walker.",
        "Yes, a Member of Congress can be expelled from their chamber (either the House of Representatives or the Senate), which is the most serious form of disciplinary action. Expulsion involves removing the member from their legislative duties and revoking their privileges of the chamber. However, it requires a two-thirds vote of the members present in the chamber for the expulsion to be approved.\n\nIt's important to note that expulsion is different from impeachment and removal from office, which is a constitutional process for removing a federal official, including a president or a member of the federal judiciary, for committing \"Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" Expulsion from Congress is a legislative remedy for misconduct, while impeachment and removal from office is a constitutional one.",

The scene where Maddy becomes extremely sick and her heart stops momentarily occurs in her home, not in Hawaii.",
        "Yes, drinking too much water can lead to water intoxication or water poisoning, which can be fatal. This condition occurs when the body takes in more water than it can effectively process, leading to an imbalance of electrolytes in the body. Severe cases can cause swelling of the brain, seizures, coma, and even death. It's important to maintain a proper balance of water and electrolytes in the body.",
        "Yes, according to the current rules of \"The Price is Right\" (since 1998), you can win both showcases if your bid for your own showcase is within $250 or less of the actual retail price. If your opponent also bids within this range for their showcase, then both of you will win the showcases. However, if either contestant overbids, they will be disqualified and the other contestant will win both showcases. If both contestants overbid or if there is a double overbid (both contestants go over the actual retail price), then neither contestant wins any showcases.",
        "No, a circle is not the same as a sphere. A circle is a two-dimensional shape, the boundary of a flat plane region, while a sphere is a three-dimensional object, the surface of a perfectly round ball. A circle is a projection of a three-dimensional sphere onto a two-dimensional plane. The cross-section of a sphere by a plane passing through its center is a circle.",
        "No, sperm concentration and sperm count are not the same thing. Sperm concentration refers to the number of sperm present in a given volume of semen, usually expressed as sperm per milliliter. Sperm count, on the other hand, is the total number of sperm present in the entire semen sample, regardless of volume. So, sperm concentration is a measure of the density or concentration of sperm in the semen, while sperm count is the total number of sperm present.",

If you are experiencing such symptoms, it is recommended to consult a healthcare professional for an evaluation.",
        "No, having more than one wife is not legally allowed in the United States. Polygamy, or the act of having multiple spouses at the same time, is against the law in all 50 states, as well as in the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico.

The educational requirements for a B.S.B.A. degree are typically more mathematics-intensive and may include additional optional quantitative coursework.",
        "Yes, in criminal law, intent or the legal term scienter (which means \"knowledge of wrongdoing with intent\"), is one of the required elements for committing a conventional crime, as opposed to a strict liability crime. This means that the prosecution must prove that the defendant intended to commit the crime or had knowledge of the wrongdoing involved in the crime.",
        "No, Top Thrill Dragster was not the tallest roller coaster at the time it was built. Although it was the first full circuit roller coaster to exceed 400 feet (120 m) in height, it was later surpassed by Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure, which stands at 450 feet (137 m) tall.",
        "No, the Red Cross is not part of the UN (United Nations). The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is an independent, neutral, and impartial humanitarian organization established in 1863. It received observer status at the UN General Assembly sessions and sub-committee meetings in 1990, but it remains an independent organization with its own mandate, governance, and resources. The agreement between the UN and the ICRC in 1993 recognized the organization's full independence from any possible interference by Switzerland or any other country.",

        "Yes, there is a medical condition known as \"broken heart syndrome\" or \"stress-induced cardiomyopathy.\" This condition is characterized by sudden heart muscle weakness, often triggered by emotional or physical stress. The symptoms can include chest pain, shortness of breath, and irregular heart rhythms. While the exact cause is not fully understood, it is believed that the release of stress hormones can lead to changes in the heart's structure and function. In some cases, broken heart syndrome can be life-threatening, but with proper treatment, most people recover fully.",
        "A table with a primary key constraint cannot have duplicate records for the columns that make up the primary key. However, it is still possible for the table to have duplicate records if the primary key consists of multiple columns. In such cases, each record must have a unique combination of values for the primary key columns.\n\nIf a table only has a single-column primary key, then there can be no duplicate records in the table for that column. But if the table has multiple columns as the primary key, then there can still be duplicate records with different combinations of values for the other columns.\n\nTherefore, while having a primary key can help ensure that a table does not have duplicate records for certain columns, it does not guarantee that the entire table is free of duplicates.",
        "Yes, the Arkansas Razorbacks have won a national championship in football, but it's important to note that there are different ways to determine a national champion in college football. The Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) has been one of the organizations that has determined a national champion based on their poll, and the Razorbacks were awarded the FWAA National Championship after the 1964 season when they went through the regular season and a bowl game undefeated. However, other organizations and selectors have different methods for determining a national champion, and some may not recognize the Razorbacks' 1964 team as a national champion.",
        "Yes, litigants on The People's Court receive payment from a fund set up by Ralph Edwards-Stu Billett Productions. However, it's important to note that the losing party does not pay the judgment to the winning party directly. Instead, both parties are paid from the fund based on the amount of the lawsuit claim.

Each litigant receives at least what remains of their half in shows concluding with that disclaimer.",
        "Yes, a ZIP Code is the same as a postal code or postcode. ZIP is an acronym for \"Zone Improvement Plan,\" which was the original name of the United States Postal Service (USPS) system using these codes to simplify mail sorting and delivery. The term \"ZIP Code\" became commonly used to refer to postal codes in general, and it is still the most widely used term in the United States. However, other English-speaking countries have their own names for the same concept, such as postcode (United Kingdom), postal code (Canada), Eircode (Ireland), and PIN Code (India).",
        "Yes, that is correct. Three Lunar Roving Vehicles (LRVs) were transported to the Moon on the Apollo Lunar Modules (LM) as part of the Apollo moon landing missions between 1971 and 1972. Once unpacked on the lunar surface, each LRV could carry one or two astronauts, their equipment, and lunar samples. After the missions, the LRVs were left on the Moon and remain there to this day.",
        "No, it is not legal to drink beer or consume any other alcoholic beverage while driving in Texas. According to Texas law, all open containers of alcohol must be stored in the trunk or a designated area not accessible to the driver or passengers while the vehicle is being operated on public roads. Consuming alcohol while driving is also against the law in Texas.",
        "Yes, blow drying your hair can kill a significant number of lice eggs, but it is not a foolproof method. According to the context provided, a standard home blow dryer can kill 96.7% of eggs with proper technique. However, it must be used repeatedly every 1 to 7 days until the natural life cycle of the lice is over, which is about 4 weeks. It's important to note that lice can also survive on other items and environments outside of the head, so other methods such as washing bedding and clothing, and using lice treatments, are also necessary to effectively eliminate a lice infestation.",
        "The movie \"The Guardian\" is not based on a true story. It is a work of fiction. While the film is set in the United States Coast Guard and their Aviation Survival Technician (AST) program, the events and characters in the movie are not based on real people or incidents.",
        "No, Lebanon has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup. Despite participating in various international football competitions, they have yet to achieve this milestone.",
        "Yes, Monaco is a sovereign city-state and microstate, which means it is a country in its own right. It has its own government, laws, and international recognition. Despite its small size and its proximity to France, Monaco is an independent principality with its own Prince as the head of state.",
        "Yes, the movie \"The Mission\" is based on true historical events surrounding the Treaty of Madrid in 1750 and the subsequent transfer of Jesuit missions from Spain to Portugal in South America. The film's plot and characters are inspired by real historical figures and events, including Father Gabriel (based on Jesuit priest Roque Gonzalez de Santa Cruz) and the Guaran\u00ed War of 1754-1756. However, it is important to note that the film is a work of fiction and takes creative liberties with the historical record for the purpose of telling a compelling story.",
        "Yes, in tennis, a set is won by the first side to win 6 games, with a margin of at least 2 games over the other side. For example, a score of 7--5 or 6--4--1 (in a tie-break) would both represent a set win with a margin of 2 games. However, if both players reach 6 games each, a tie-break game is played to determine the winner of the set. In the tie-break game, the first side to win 7 points with a margin of 2 points over their opponent wins the game and the set.",
        "Yes, China has qualified for the FIFA World Cup. They first attempted to qualify in 1957 for the 1958 World Cup, but they were unsuccessful. China then qualified for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, which marked their first appearance in the tournament. The qualification was considered a great accomplishment in Chinese football history and was a source of national pride, with a large number of people tuning in to watch the matches.",
        "No, England did reach the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup, but they lost to Croatia. Therefore, they did not make it to the final.",
        "Green beans and French beans are not exactly the same, but they are closely related. French beans are a type of green bean that has larger, fully-grown seeds inside the pod. When you buy French beans at the market, you typically find them with the strings removed since they do not snap easily like green beans. Green beans, on the other hand, are picked when the pods are young and immature, and the seeds inside are not fully developed. The term \"French beans\" is often used interchangeably with \"green beans,\" but technically, French beans refer to a specific type of green bean with larger seeds.",
        "Yes, all of Japan observes the same time zone, which is Japan Standard Time (JST) or UTC+09:00. There is no daylight saving time in Japan.",
        "Yes, Spider-Man: Homecoming is a sequel to The Amazing Spider-Man films, but it is a reboot of the Spider-Man franchise within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Tom Holland's portrayal of Spider-Man/Peter Parker in Homecoming is different from Andrew Garfield's portrayal in The Amazing Spider-Man and its sequel. The films share some elements, but Homecoming introduces new characters, storylines, and themes.",
        "No, the entire blastocyst does not develop into a fetus. The blastocyst is an early stage of embryonic development in mammals. The inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst gives rise to the embryo, while the outer layer of cells, the trophoblast, gives rise to the placenta. The fetus is the developing organism from the embryonic stage onwards, after the implantation of the blastocyst into the uterine wall and the formation of the placenta.",
        "Yes, some people are ambidextrous, meaning they have the ability to use both their left and right hand equally well for various tasks. However, it's important to note that true ambidexterity is rare and usually only applies to specific tasks or activities. Most people have a dominant hand for most activities, even if they can use their non-dominant hand for certain tasks with some degree of proficiency.",
        "As of now, there has not been an official announcement of a fourth season for Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries. The third season concluded in 2015. However, there have been discussions about a potential return of the series. Stay tuned for updates.",
        "Yes, a player can go out with a Wild card in UNO. When a player plays a Wild card, they can declare any color to continue play. If the next player does not have a card of the declared color, they must draw two cards from the draw pile. If a player has a Wild card of the same color, they can play it to continue the sequence of that color and try to go out. If a player goes out with a Wild card, they win the hand and score points for the remaining cards held by the other players.",
        "Yes, a US citizen can hold a foreign title, as long as they do not accept or receive any compensation or emoluments from the foreign government in connection with that title without the consent of the United States Congress. The Title of Nobility Clause in the US Constitution only prohibits the federal government from granting titles of nobility to US citizens and from recognizing or accepting titles of nobility from foreign governments. It does not restrict US citizens from holding or accepting titles from foreign entities or organizations that are not connected to a foreign government. However, if the foreign title comes with significant privileges or financial benefits, it could potentially implicate other provisions of the Constitution, such as the Emoluments Clause.",
        "No, a Social Security number is always a nine-digit number. The format includes a three-digit area number, a two-digit group number, and a four-digit serial number. Therefore, there are never eight digits in a valid Social Security number.",
        "Yes, Don Budge was the first person to win all four major tennis titles (known as a Grand Slam) in a single year, which he accomplished in 1938. However, it's important to note that the term \"Grand Slam\" was not used consistently until the 1960s, and the specific tournaments that make up the Grand Slam have changed over time. In the current era, the four major tennis tournaments are the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open.\n\nSince Budge's achievement in 1938, a total of 17 players have completed a Grand Slam in tennis, though only six have done so in the singles discipline. Of those six, three have accomplished the feat more than once: Rod Laver did it twice in men's singles, Margaret Court did it three times, once in women's singles and twice in mixed doubles, and Esther Vergeer did it twice in Women's wheelchair doubles.",
        "No, ITV Hub is not available on Xbox 360. The ITV Hub app that was launched on Xbox One is a Universal Windows Platform app, which is not compatible with Xbox 360.

        "Yes, the Prime Minister in the context described is typically the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the largest number of seats in the House of Commons, making it a requirement for the Prime Minister to be a Member of Parliament (MP). This convention is based on the need for the Prime Minister to have the confidence of the House of Commons and to be able to effectively govern with the support of a parliamentary majority.",
        "No, a Veterans ID (VIC) cannot be used to gain access to military installations. You would need a DoD Uniformed Services ID or a retiree ID card for that purpose.",
        "Yes, in the United States, it is illegal for anyone under the age of 21 to be in possession of alcohol, with the exception of certain special circumstances. This law is referred to as a Minor in Possession (MIP) or Possession of Alcohol Under the Legal Age (PAULA) law. The specific consequences of violating this law, such as whether it is charged as a misdemeanor or an infraction, can vary depending on the state and the county within the state.",

        "Yes, there can be a beach on a lake. A beach is simply a landform adjacent to a body of water where the land meets the water's edge. Beaches can form on the shores of lakes just as they do on the shores of seas and oceans.",
        "Yes, Puerto Rico is required to follow most federal laws because of the plenary powers granted to the U.S. Congress under the territorial clause of the U.S. Constitution. This means that federal laws apply to Puerto Rico unless they are specifically inapplicable or treat Puerto Rico differently. However, the U.S. government's power over Puerto Rico is not absolute and is restrained by some fundamental rights possessed by anyone subject to the authority of the U.S. government. There have been rare instances where courts have held that certain federal laws do not apply to Puerto Rico, but these decisions have been subject to challenge.",
        "No, not every US citizen has a Social Security number. Some religious and philosophical groups, such as the Old Order Amish, have been granted exemptions from the Social Security program and therefore do not have Social Security numbers. Additionally, some undocumented immigrants may not have Social Security numbers. However, most Americans do have Social Security numbers, and they are required for various legal and financial transactions, such as filing taxes or obtaining employment.",
        "According to our current understanding of physics, particularly the special theory of relativity, no object or information can travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum. This includes all known particles and forms of energy. The hypothesis of tachyons, particles that would travel faster than light, is a topic of ongoing research and debate in the field of physics, but the consensus is that their existence would violate fundamental principles such as causality and the principle of relativity. Therefore, based on our current knowledge, nothing can be faster than the speed of light.",
        "Yes, Mr. Robot has been renewed for a fourth season. However, the release date has not been announced yet.",
        "Yes, it is possible for an element to have different types of atoms, called isotopes. Isotopes of an element have the same number of protons (atomic number) but a different number of neutrons (mass number) in their nuclei. For example, carbon has three naturally occurring isotopes: carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14. Carbon-12 has 6 neutrons, carbon-13 has 7 neutrons, and carbon-14 has 8 neutrons. Despite having different numbers of neutrons, all three are still considered carbon atoms because they have the same number of protons.",
        "Yes, a cougar and a mountain lion are the same animal. The term \"mountain lion\" is a regional name used primarily in the western United States and Canada to refer to the cougar. Other names for the cougar, such as puma, panther, and catamount, are used more commonly in other regions. So, while there may be slight variations in how the animal is named depending on the location, the cougar and mountain lion are one and the same species.",
        "Yes, Jimmy O (James O'Phelan, portrayed by Titus Welliver) dies in \"Sons of Anarchy.\" In the scene you described, Chibs and some members of SAMCRO confront Jimmy O after he is handed over to Agent Stahl by SAMCRO as part of a deal with the Russians.

        "No, Triamcinolone acetonide cream is not used specifically to treat poison ivy. The context mentions that Triamcinolone acetonide as a topical ointment is used to mitigate blistering from poison ivy, oak, and sumac, but it does not specify that the cream form is the one used for this purpose. The cream may have other uses, but for treating poison ivy, the ointment form is typically recommended.",
        "Yes, an Xbox 360 game can work on an Xbox One through Xbox 360 backward compatibility. However, it's important to note that the game does not run directly from the disc. Instead, a ported version of the game is downloaded automatically when a supported game is inserted, or digitally-purchased games will automatically appear for download in the user's library once available. The disc is still required for validation purposes.",
        "Yes, there is such a thing as a jackrabbit. Contrary to its name, a jackrabbit is not a rabbit but rather a type of large hares native to North America. They are characterized by their long ears and the ability to jump long distances. Despite the name \"jackalope\" suggesting a combination of a jackrabbit and an antelope, jackrabbits are not related to antelopes.",
        "Based on the information provided, it appears that there were plans for a seventh Tinker Bell movie, but the project was canceled due to story problems. There is currently no information available indicating that a new Tinker Bell movie is in production.",
        "Cash Money and Money Mart are not the same company, but they are related. Cash Money is a global financial services provider that offers a variety of products and services, including payday loans, installment loans, and money orders. It has its headquarters in the United States and operates in several countries, including the United States, Canada, and other parts of the world.\n\nMoney Mart, on the other hand, is a Canadian financial services company that provides payday loans, cheque cashing, tax preparation, and money transfer services. It was founded in 1982 and had 465 stores across Canada as of 2016. Money Mart is a subsidiary of Dollar Financial Group, Inc., which also owns and operates Cash Money in the United States and other countries.\n\nSo, while Cash Money and Money Mart are related companies, they are not the same entity. Money Mart is a Canadian subsidiary of Dollar Financial Group, Inc., which also owns and operates Cash Money in other parts of the world.",
        "Yes, it is perfectly safe to eat cooking apples raw. Contrary to popular belief, cooking apples do not pose any harm when consumed uncooked. Their tart taste and potential stomach discomfort are the only reasons behind the myth that they should not be eaten raw.",
        "Yes, according to the given context, the Texas flag is required to be flown at the same height as the U.S. flag when both are displayed together at the Texas State Capitol. However, the specific positions of each flag may vary (north door for Texas and south door for the U.S. flag). The context also mentions that there are exceptions when the flags are flown at half mast or when the POW/MIA flag is being flown with the U.S. flag. In those cases, the Texas flag is only flown at the North Door.",
        "Based on the context provided, yes, it is currently Ordinary Time in the Catholic Church.

The nine-digit ABA routing number is used to identify the financial institution involved in a financial transaction, whether it be for paper cheques or electronic payments such as Automated Clearing House (ACH) or wires.",
        "No, a hashtag is not the same as the number sign. The number sign (#) is a symbol used in mathematics and in text messaging to represent the number 12. However, when used at the beginning of a word or phrase on social media platforms, the number sign is used as a hashtag to tag and categorize content. So, while the number sign is the character used for hashtags, the term \"hashtag\" refers to the use of that character to identify and categorize content on social media.",
        "No, the F train does not stop at Queens Plaza station according to the provided context. The F train is not listed as a service that stops at this station on the IND Queens Boulevard Line.",
        "Yes, there is a difference between slugs and snails. The common name \"snail\" is typically used for gastropods that have a visible, external, coiled shell that they can retract into for protection. Slugs, on the other hand, are gastropods that do not have an external shell or have only an internal shell. Instead, they have a slimy trail that they leave behind as they move. Some land snails are also called semi-slugs because they have a very small shell that they cannot retract into. So, the main difference between slugs and snails is the presence or absence of a visible, external shell.",
        "The French Quarter was not affected by flooding during Hurricane Katrina as it is located above sea level. However, the storm did cause significant damage to other parts of New Orleans, resulting in extensive flooding and breaches in the levees and floodwalls at the 17th Street Canal, Industrial Canal, and London Avenue Canal, among others. These breaches led to the flooding of approximately 80% of the city.",

In the context of the given problem, the goal is to find a point that lies on the intersection of two planes defined by their normal vectors, and the resulting point will satisfy the equations of both planes.",
        "Yes, professional soccer players can play in the Olympics. However, historically, several strong men's national soccer teams have had unimpressive Olympic records due to various reasons. Some teams, like Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil, had long absences from the Olympics or failed to qualify due to changes in eligibility rules that prevented professional athletes from participating. Other teams, like Italy and France, have had limited success in the tournament. Spain is another example of a team that has only won the Olympic gold medal once, in 1992, but has had some success with silver medals in 1920 and 2000. Since 1992, when professional athletes were allowed to compete in the Olympics, many top soccer players have participated in the tournament.",

        "Yes, according to Paul D. MacLean's triune brain theory, the limbic system is considered to be an older part of the brain. It is believed to have evolved before other parts of the forebrain and is associated with emotional responses, memory, and motivation. This theory suggests that the limbic system developed to manage the circuitry related to the fight or flight response, which is a crucial aspect of survival adaptation in both reptiles and mammals, including humans.",
        "No, Target and Macy's are not owned by the same company. While Target is a subsidiary of the American multinational retail corporation, Target Corporation, Macy's is a subsidiary of Macy's, Inc.

        "No, an aftershock cannot be stronger than the main shock that preceded it. An aftershock is a smaller earthquake that follows the main shock, and its magnitude and seismic waveforms are generally smaller than those of the main shock. The misconception might arise because the term \"aftershock\" implies that it is a weaker event following a stronger one, but in reality, the magnitude and energy released by aftershocks are typically much less than that of the main shock.",
        "Yes, there are wild ravens in the UK. They are more common in Scotland, Wales, northern England, and the west of Ireland.",
        "Yes, the Hyundai Genesis Coup\u00e9 is classified as a sports car.

Its design and specifications are intended to provide agile handling and responsive performance, which are typical characteristics of sports cars.",
        "Yes, a death certificate generally shows the cause of death. However, in some cases, particularly in the United States after 1990 and in certain states like New York, the cause of death may be redacted on certificates issued to the general public for deaths classified as natural, to protect HIV confidentiality. But, immediate family members, law enforcement agencies, and governmental authorities are still able to obtain the full death certificates containing the cause of death information.",

        "Monozygotic twins, also known as identical twins, share the same genetic material and develop from a single fertilized egg that splits into two separate embryos. While they are genetically nearly identical, there can be rare occurrences of mutations during development that may result in the twins being of different sexes. This is due to a process called sex determination, which can be influenced by various factors such as genetic mutations or environmental influences. However, these occurrences are extremely rare, estimated to be less than 1 in 10,000 monozygotic twin pairs. Therefore, the likelihood of having identical twins of different genders is very low.",

        "Yes, The Girl in the Spider's Web is a sequel to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. It continues the story of Lisbeth Salander, the character played by Rooney Mara in the previous film adaptation. However, unlike the previous books and film versions, The Girl in the Spider's Web is the first in the series to be produced into an English-language film as an initial adaptation. The new film has an entirely new cast, with Claire Foy taking over the role of Salander, and Sylvia Hoeks cast in an undisclosed role.",
        "Yes, the movie 300 is based on real events, but it takes significant creative license with the historical record. The film is inspired by the Battle of Thermopylae, which took place in 480 BC between the Greek city-states and the Persian Empire. However, the movie greatly exaggerates the number of Spartans present, their weapons, and the overall scale of the battle. It is important to remember that historical accuracy is not the primary goal of the film, but rather to tell an engaging and visually stunning story based on the events of the Battle of Thermopylae.",

        "Yes, you can send an envelope without a return address. However, as mentioned in the context, doing so may prevent the postal service from being able to return the item if it becomes undeliverable for various reasons. This could result in the mail being treated as dead letter mail. If you are sending the mail and do not require it to be returned, then not including a return address may not be an issue. However, if there is a possibility that you may need the item to be returned, it is recommended to include a return address to ensure it can be properly handled by the postal service.",

        "No, the United States did not qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. They had a streak of appearing in every World Cup since 1990, but they were eliminated in the CONCACAF qualifying round.",
        "Yes, a money order and a postal order are similar financial instruments. Both are used to send money through the mail and are payable to a named recipient at a post office or other designated location. The main difference is that money orders can be purchased from various sources, such as banks, post offices, and other financial institutions, while postal orders are specifically issued by postal services. However, in the United States, the term \"money order\" is often used interchangeably with \"postal money order.\"",
        "Yes, Kaori dies in the manga and anime series \"Your Lie in April\" (Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso). She passes away due to complications from a surgery. However, before her death, she confesses her true feelings to K\u014dsei in a letter, revealing that her previous declarations of love for Watari were fabricated in order to be closer to K\u014dsei without hurting Tsubaki's feelings. After her death, K\u014dsei finds comfort in Tsubaki's support.",

        "No, under the laws of the State of Utah, a man cannot legally have more than one wife at a time. The case of Thomas Green, who was convicted of bigamy in 2001, established that cohabitation with a previously divorced spouse can be considered evidence of a common-law marriage, making the subsequent marriage bigamous. This ruling is specific to the State of Utah and does not apply to other jurisdictions. It is important to note that bigamy is a crime in most, if not all, states in the United States.",
        "Yes, Roger Daltrey of The Who is known for his distinctive stuttering delivery in the song \"My Generation.\" However, it's important to note that the reason for this delivery is a subject of various stories and interpretations. Some believe it was inspired by John Lee Hooker's \"Stuttering Blues,\" while others suggest it was intended to give a framework for implying an expletive in the lyrics or to mimic the sound of a British mod on speed. Yet another explanation is that it was a happy accident during recording caused by Daltrey's nerves and inability to hear his own voice through the monitors.",
        "Yes, an Ace beats a Queen in the game of War, as Aces are ranked higher than Queens in this game.",
        "No, 1-2-Switch is not a pack-in game for the Nintendo Switch. It is a separate game that must be purchased in addition to the console. This decision has been a subject of debate among commentators, with some arguing that it would have been better as a pack-in game, while others support Nintendo's decision to allow consumers to choose which games to purchase. Cory Arnold of Destructoid specifically criticized the lack of a true single-player mode and the perceived lack of progression in the minigames compared to Wii Sports.",
        "No, Maria, played by Isabel Lucas, does not die in the movie \"The Impossible\" (2012). The scene where Lucas finds his mother in a private room in the ICU after being reunited with her clarifies that she is alive. The confusion earlier in the movie regarding Maria's medical chart being mixed up with another patient who had died was a mistake and did not result in Maria's death.",
        "Yes, Aero bars can still be found in the United States at certain specialty vendors and supermarkets that import the bars, such as Big Y, Wegmans, and Publix. However, they are not widely available and may not be stocked at all regular supermarkets or convenience stores. Hershey also sells a similar bar called Hershey's Air Delight in the United States.",
        "Yes, citizens in Puerto Rico pay some U.S. taxes, but they also pay taxes to the Puerto Rican government. Puerto Rico has independent tax-levying authority, but the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) of the United States also applies to Puerto Rico and its residents for certain taxes, such as income taxes on individuals and corporations. Therefore, Puerto Rican citizens may be required to pay federal income taxes on their earnings, but they also pay Commonwealth taxes, which may include income tax, property tax, and sales and use tax. However, Puerto Rico does not have a separate payroll tax system like the Social Security and Medicare taxes that apply in the 50 states. Instead, residents of Puerto Rico are subject to Social Security taxes if they work for an employer that is subject to U.S. employment taxes or if they are self-employed and meet certain income thresholds. They are also subject to Medicare taxes on their wages and self-employment income.",
        "Yes, green beans and string beans are the same vegetable. The term \"string beans\" comes from the fact that some varieties of green beans have a string-like fibers on the edges of the beans that need to be removed before eating. However, many modern varieties of green beans are \"stringless\" or have very thin strings. So, while all string beans are green beans, not all green beans are string beans (in the traditional sense).",
        "No, not all points on the Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF) represent efficient points. Only the points where the marginal rate of transformation (MRT) is equal to all consumers' marginal rate of substitution (MRS) and hence equal to the ratio of prices are Pareto efficient. These points represent the optimal combination of goods that cannot be improved upon without making one consumer worse off. However, there can be multiple Pareto efficient points on the PPF, depending on the specific preferences and resource endowments of the economy.",
        "Yes, the Battle of Gettysburg was one of the bloodiest battles of the American Civil War. It resulted in approximately 51,000 total casualties (dead, wounded, and missing) between both the Union and Confederate armies, making it the largest number of casualties in a single battle during the war.",
        "Yes, cows need to be pregnant in order to produce milk. Milk production is a result of the energy requirements of the developing fetus and the metabolic processes of the cow. After giving birth, the cow's body starts producing milk to feed her calf. This is known as lactation. The milk production continues until the cow is dried off, which is typically around 60 days before she calves again. So, within the context of modern dairy farming, cows are kept pregnant and lactating in a continuous cycle to maximize milk production.",
        "No, Methodist is not the same as the Church of England. Methodism originated as a movement within the Church of England in the 18th century, but it became a separate nonconformist church after Wesley's death.

If you're asking about future seasons, there have been no official announcements as of now. However, given the popularity of the series, it's not entirely unlikely that there will be more seasons in the future.",
        "The bodies of 13 SEALs and 14 Army Special Operations aviators were recovered after Operation Red Wings.

The remaining bodies of the SEALs and all of the Army Special Operations aviators were recovered from the crash site.",
        "Yes, \"ain't\" is a word included in Webster's Third New International Dictionary. The dictionary acknowledges that its usage is controversial and more common in less educated speech, but it includes the word with an acknowledgment of its prevalence in certain contexts.",
        "Collard greens and turnip greens are not the same vegetable. Collard greens are a type of cabbage that is characterized by their large, flat, and dark-green leaves. Turnip greens, on the other hand, are the leaves of the turnip plant, which is a root vegetable. Turnip greens have a more textured and slightly bitter taste compared to collard greens. While they can be prepared in similar ways, such as being cooked with smoked meats and onions, they have distinct flavors and textures.",
        "Yes, in the Supernatural episode \"No Rest for the Wicked\" from season 4, Dean comes back to life after having gone to hell at the end of season 3. The episode introduces the character of Castiel, an angel who plays a significant role in helping Dean return from the underworld.",

        "Yes, the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a part of the endomembrane system. The endomembrane system is a network of membrane-bound organelles that enclose the cytoplasm and participate in various cellular functions, including the synthesis, modification, and transport of proteins and lipids. The rough ER is a major site for protein synthesis, where ribosomes attached to the ER surface produce polypeptide chains, which are then modified and transported to their final destinations within the cell.",

But for an average situation, a President can serve a maximum of two terms.",
        "Yes, the cardiac sphincter and the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) are the same structure. The terms are used interchangeably to refer to the muscle ring that surrounds the lower part of the esophagus at the junction with the stomach. Dysfunction of this sphincter can lead to gastroesophageal reflux and its associated symptoms, including heartburn and the development of gastroesophageal reflux disease.",
        "Yes, \"Pawn Stars\" is filmed at the actual World Famous Gold & Silver Pawn Shop in Las Vegas, Nevada. The show features the day-to-day business transactions and interactions between the shop's staff and customers, making it an authentic representation of the pawn shop experience.",
        "No, tomato puree is not the same as tomato sauce. Tomato puree has a thicker consistency and a deeper flavor compared to tomato sauce. Tomato sauce, on the other hand, has a thinner consistency and is often cooked longer to develop a richer flavor. Both can be used in various dishes, but they are not interchangeable based on their consistency and flavor profiles.",
        "Yes, the Tom and Jerry cartoons produced by Van Beuren Studios from 1931 to 1933 are in the public domain. This is because the copyright on these works has expired, making them available for use by the general public without the need for permission or payment to the copyright holders. However, it's important to note that the specific versions of these cartoons that are available online may be subject to copyright law if they have been digitally restored or edited in some way. It's always a good idea to check the specific licensing terms for any particular use of public domain material.",
        "No, the Penguins are not out of the Stanley Cup playoffs yet. The information provided in the context only discusses their past performance against the Capitals in the playoffs and their history of meeting in decisive Game 7s. It does not mention their current Stanley Cup prospects.",
        "In Canada, the carrying of knives is generally allowed, but there are certain restrictions and exceptions based on the type and size of the knife, as well as the specific circumstances and locations.\n\nCanadian law does not prohibit the possession of most types of knives, including pocket knives, hunting knives, and chef's knives.

        "Yes, Eddie Murphy sang \"Party All the Time\" for the single release. However, in the music video and some live performances, he lip-synced while Rick James and his band provided the musical backing and vocals. This was a common practice in the music industry during that time. The misconception that Murphy never sang the song himself comes from the belief that he only lip-synced in all performances, which is not entirely true.",
        "No, the Cash for Clunkers program is not still active. The initial $1 billion appropriated for the program was exhausted by July 30, 2009, and the program officially ended on August 24, 2009. However, in response to the high demand, Congress approved an additional $2 billion, but this funding was not used as the program had already ended.",
        "Yes, the United States Coast Guard is a branch of the United States Armed Forces and is considered a military organization. However, it is unique among the U.S. military branches as it also has a maritime law enforcement mission and a federal regulatory agency mission. The Coast Guard operates under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during peacetime but can be transferred to the U.S. Department of the Navy during times of war.",
        "Yes, there is such a thing as a citizens' arrest in common law jurisdictions. It is an arrest made by a person who is not acting as a sworn law-enforcement official. However, the specific circumstances under which a citizen can make a valid arrest, and the procedures that must be followed, can vary depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances of the case. It is important to note that making an unjustified or improper citizens' arrest can result in legal consequences for the person making the arrest.",

The Utah Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control regulates the sale of alcoholic beverages in the state.",
        "Yes, sharks can die if their fins are cut off. The process of shark finning often involves removing the fins while the shark is still alive. The shark is then typically thrown back into the water, unable to swim effectively due to the loss of its fins. This can result in a slow and painful death by suffocation or predation. However, some countries have implemented regulations that require the whole shark to be brought back to port before the fins are removed, which can help reduce the number of sharks that die as a result of finning.",
        "Yes, hydrated lime and calcium hydroxide are the same substance. Hydrated lime is simply a term used to describe calcium hydroxide in its crystalline or powdered form that has absorbed some water of hydration.

        "No, inflation does not mean that specific prices are rising and relative prices are falling. Inflation refers to an overall increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy, not the change in the relative prices of specific goods or services. The example given in the context of people buying more cucumbers than tomatoes is an illustration of a shift in demand and not related to inflation. Inflation is related to the value of currency itself, and an increase in the supply of money can lead to inflation as the value of each unit of currency decreases.",
        "Yes, a set is an element of its power set. Specifically, the set itself is the subset with all elements included, so it is an element of its power set. This might seem paradoxical, but it is a fundamental property of power sets in set theory.",

La Voie case in Colorado, yes, you have the right to protect yourself if you have reasonable grounds for believing that you are in imminent danger of being killed or receiving great bodily harm, even if it later turns out that the danger was not real or was exaggerated.

If you have any specific concerns about your safety or the applicability of this legal principle to your situation, you should consult with a legal professional for advice.",
        "Yes, in the UK, you do need a Firearm Certificate (FAC) to own an air rifle that generates more than 12 ft lbf (16.2 J) of muzzle energy. Air rifles within this power limit are considered \"specifically dangerous firearms\" and are subject to the regulations outlined in the Firearms Act 1968. However, air pistols generating more than 6 ft lbf (8.1 J) of muzzle energy are considered \"Prohibited Weapons\" and cannot be owned privately; they can only be possessed by individuals or organizations with Section 5 Authority, usually granted to members of the Gun Trade.",

        "No, Mighty Joe Young is not a true story. It is a work of fiction, based on the 1949 film of the same name. The story of a human raising a giant gorilla and protecting it from poachers is not based on real events.",
        "Yes, New Zealand is roughly on the other side of the world from places like Britain and Ireland. This is why it is called the \"Antipodes\" of these countries, and its inhabitants are referred to as \"Antipodeans.\" However, it is important to note that \"the other side of the world\" is a relative term, and New Zealand is not exactly opposite to any specific place on the globe. Instead, it lies roughly in the southern hemisphere, across the International Date Line from the Pacific Ocean, and is antipodal to places in the northern hemisphere such as Britain and Ireland.",
        "Yes, work can be done in a closed system. A closed system is defined by the fact that no mass can be transferred in or out of the system boundaries. However, the system can still exchange energy with its surroundings through the means of work or heat transfer. Work is a form of energy transfer that occurs when a force is applied to an object and the object moves in the direction of the force. In a closed system, work can be done on or by the system as long as there is a force acting upon a mass within the system boundaries. For example, a gas expanding against a piston can do work by moving the piston, even though no mass is transferred across the system boundary.",

        "Yes, in the context of English legal history, general law and common law are related concepts. Common law refers to the body of law that was developed through court decisions and judgments, as opposed to being codified in statutes. This common law was shared among the different circuits in the royal court system and held in common between jurisdictions, making it general law. So, in this historical context, general law can be considered a synonym for common law.",

        "Yes, substrate-level phosphorylation can occur in the absence of oxygen. This process does not require external electron acceptors, such as oxygen, to generate ATP through the synthesis of a phosphate group on an ADP molecule. Instead, the energy released during the oxidation of substrates is directly used to power the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. Examples of this process include glycolysis in anaerobic conditions, where pyruvate is converted to lactate and ATP is generated through substrate-level phosphorylation, and anaplerotic reactions in the citric acid cycle. However, the overall yield of ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation is generally lower compared to oxidative phosphorylation.",
        "No, Switzerland does not give a gun to every household. Firearms ownership in Switzerland is regulated, and individuals must go through a permitting process to legally purchase and possess firearms. The types of firearms that can be owned also vary, with semi-automatic firearms being the most commonly owned, while fully automatic weapons, silencers, and target lasers require special permits. Additionally, the use of certain types of ammunition, such as hollow-point and soft-point, is limited to hunting.",
        "Based on the information provided, there are cameo appearances of Jason David Frank and Amy Jo Johnson in the new Power Rangers movie, but it does not specify that they are reprising their roles as the original Power Rangers.

        "Yes, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Caribou and Reindeer are actually the same species, Rangifer tarandus. The name \"Caribou\" is used in North America, while the name \"Reindeer\" is used in Europe. Therefore, a Caribou is the same thing as a Reindeer.",

The American Revolutionary War began in April 1775, more than a year before the Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 4, 1776 (even though the signing of the Declaration is often celebrated on July 4). The Declaration was a formal explanation of why Congress had voted to declare independence from Great Britain, in response to growing tensions and grievances against British rule.",
        "Puerto Rico does not have voting representation in the United States Congress, and therefore its residents do not participate in the process of electing the President and Vice President through the Electoral College. However, Puerto Rican residents do have the right to vote in primary elections for the Presidential nominees of the major political parties. They can also apply for, and vote in, federal elections if they are living in the United States as U.S. citizens, but this does not grant them the right to electoral votes in the Electoral College.",
        "No, a player cannot hit the backboard on a free throw in basketball. The free throw is shot from a specific location, called the free throw line, which is directly in front of the basket. The rules state that during a foul shot, a player's foot must be completely behind the foul line. If any part of the player's foot is on or over the foul line when they shoot, it is considered a violation, and the shot does not count. Hitting the backboard would require the ball to travel above the rim, which is not allowed during a free throw.",
        "Yes, there was a Jaws ride at Universal Studios Hollywood, but it has been closed since 2012.

Additionally, other elements of the outfit, such as slacks, khakis, or skirts, and closed-toe shoes should also adhere to the business casual dress code.",
        "No, Morgan Stanley is not currently part of JPMorgan Chase. In the given context, it was reported that JPMorgan Chase was offered the opportunity to acquire Morgan Stanley for no cost during the 2008 financial crisis, but the offer was declined by JPMorgan Chase's CEO, Jamie Dimon.",

The Tour at Universal Studios gives guests a behind-the-scenes look at the studio, allowing them to pass by active film sets and production areas. However, the Tour itself is not typically where movies are filmed. Instead, the Tour allows visitors to see the sets and props used in past and current film productions.",
        "No, Go and Othello (also known as Reversi) are similar in that they are both zero-sum, perfect-information, partisan, deterministic strategy games. However, they have significant differences in their game play.\n\nThe rules of Go involve placing stones on a grid-like board with the objective of controlling more territory than your opponent. The game continues until both players pass their turn, and there are no more empty intersections left on the board.\n\nIn contrast, Othello is played on a similar sized board with the objective of flipping opponent's pieces by surrounding them with your own pieces. The game ends when all pieces have been placed on the board or when one player cannot make a valid move.\n\nAlthough both games have simple rules, the strategy in Go is more complex due to its larger board size and the need to plan several moves ahead to secure territories and prevent your opponent from doing the same. In Othello, the focus is more on the immediate capture of opponent's pieces and blocking their moves.\n\nSo while there are similarities between Go and Othello, they are distinct games with unique strategies and challenges.",

        "Yes, The Mummy (2017) is a reboot or a new adaptation of the original The Mummy film series. It is not a direct remake as it has different actors, new characters, and a revised storyline, but it shares the same title and the general concept of the ancient Egyptian mummy coming back to life and wreaking havoc. The 2017 film is also the first installment in Universal's Dark Universe franchise, which aims to bring classic monster characters together in a shared cinematic universe.",
        "No, India is not the first country to reach Mars. As mentioned in the context, India's Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) became the first Mars mission for India and the first for Asia, but several other countries had already sent missions to Mars before India. The Soviet Union and the United States (NASA) are the first and second countries to have successfully reached Mars orbit, respectively. The European Space Agency also reached Mars orbit before India.",

However, after 2006, the American version of the Creme Eggs weighed 34 g and contained 150 calories.",
        "Himalayan Pink Salt and Himalayan Sea Salt are often used interchangeably in marketing, but they are not exactly the same. Himalayan Pink Salt comes from the Himalayan Mountains, specifically from the Khewra Salt Mine in Pakistan. This salt deposit was formed from an ancient seabed that became landlocked and evaporated around 100 to 250 million years ago. The pink color of the salt is due to the presence of red mineral pigments, primarily from the microorganism Halobacterium, which thrived in the ancient seabed.\n\nHowever, the term \"Himalayan Sea Salt\" is not a standardized or recognized geological or geographical term. It is often used as a marketing term to refer to Himalayan Pink Salt or other types of pink salt from the Himalayas. While the salt comes from a seabed, it is no longer technically \"sea salt\" as it has been mined and processed from its natural state.\n\nSo, while Himalayan Pink Salt and Himalayan Sea Salt are related, they are not exactly the same. Himalayan Pink Salt is a specific type of salt that comes from the Himalayas, while \"Himalayan Sea Salt\" is a marketing term that may refer to the same salt.",
        "No, the Paralympic Games and Special Olympics World Games are not the same event.

It is a specific species of turtle, scientifically known as Macrochelys temminckii, which is native to freshwater habitats in the United States. This species is known for its large size and distinctive appearance, with a wide, flat head and powerful jaws, earning it the name \"snapping turtle.\" The common name \"alligator\" refers to the rough, scaled texture on its head, which resembles the skin of an alligator.",
        "Yes, in the United States, there is a practice known as the \"Designated Survivor\" or \"Designated Successor\" program. It is an arrangement made to ensure continuity of government in the event of a catastrophic occurrence that kills the President, the Vice President, and other officials in the presidential line of succession. A designated survivor is usually a member of the U.S. Cabinet who is kept at a secure and undisclosed location during certain events, such as State of the Union addresses and presidential inaugurations. If such an event were to occur, the surviving official highest in the line of succession, possibly the designated survivor, would become the Acting President of the United States under the Presidential Succession Act.",
        "Yes, you can carry a handgun in your car in Wisconsin without a license, loaded or uncased. For long guns, they must be uncased but not loaded and must be discernible to ordinary observation. Those with a concealed carry license may still conceal a pistol in a vehicle. However, there is some confusion regarding whether an encased gun is concealed, so it's best practice to keep long guns out of reach if they are cased.",
        "Yes, it is possible for an individual to have more than one anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders are distinct conditions, and a person can experience symptoms of multiple types of anxiety disorders at the same time. For example, someone may have both generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder.

If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of anxiety disorders, it is recommended to seek help from a mental health professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",
        "Yes, in the United States, the entire state votes for both of its Senators.

        "Aquagenic urticaria is not a true allergic reaction to water. While it is sometimes referred to as a \"water allergy,\" this term is misleading. The condition is characterized by an itchy skin reaction to contact with water, regardless of its temperature or the presence of chemicals. It is not a histamine-releasing allergic reaction like other forms of urticaria. Instead, the exact cause of aquagenic urticaria is not well understood and is currently a topic of ongoing research.",

        "Yes, it is possible to heat water above its normal boiling point of 100 \u00b0C (212 \u00b0F) under atmospheric pressure. This is referred to as superheated water or pressurized hot water. However, it is important to note that this is different from the common use of the term \"superheating\" to describe water at atmospheric pressure above its normal boiling point, which has not boiled due to a lack of nucleation sites. In the context of superheated water, the water remains in a liquid state due to the overpressure that raises the boiling point or by heating it in a sealed vessel with a headspace, where the liquid water is in equilibrium with vapor at the saturated vapor pressure.",
        "Yes, there are several spin-offs of Grey's Anatomy. Station 19 is one of them. It was created by Stacy McKee and is set at Seattle Fire Station 19, focusing on the lives of the firefighters.

        "Yes, it is possible to get two Yahtzees in a single game of Yahtzee. Each turn, the player rolls five dice and sets aside any dice that match a category they want to fill. If they roll five dice that match the same number, they have rolled a Yahtzee and can fill the Yahtzee category with that score, plus receive the bonus points if the category is already filled. The player can continue rolling and setting aside dice until they are satisfied with their scores in each category. Therefore, if the player gets lucky and rolls two Yahtzees during the same game, they can fill the Yahtzee category twice and receive the bonus points each time.",

There are larger malls in the world, such as the New South China Mall in Dongguan, China, which holds the record for the largest retail space in the world.",
        "Yes, microbes can have symbiotic relationships with other microbes. This is called interspecific symbiosis. In such relationships, two different species of microbes live in close proximity to each other and benefit from the interaction. For instance, in the gut of termites, Zoogloea bacteria form a mutualistic relationship with protozoan flagellates, such as Zoamastigotes. The Zoogloea bacteria produce vitamins and other nutrients that the protozoans need, while the protozoans help the bacteria access complex organic compounds, like cellulose, that the bacteria cannot digest on their own. This relationship is essential for the termites' digestive system and allows them to break down and utilize plant matter as a food source.",
        "No, you do not have to be an All-Star to participate in the Home Run Derby. The Home Run Derby is a separate event that takes place before the All-Star Game, and the participants are selected based on their home run production during the current Major League Baseball season.

        "A provisional license and a learner's permit are similar in that they are both types of restricted licenses for drivers who are still learning. However, there may be some differences between the two depending on the specific laws and regulations of the jurisdiction in question.\n\nIn some places, a learner's permit is the initial permit that is issued to a driver when they first start learning to drive. It may come with certain restrictions, such as requiring the driver to be accompanied by a licensed driver while they are driving. After a certain period of time and completing additional requirements, such as driver's education and a road test, the learner may be eligible to upgrade to a provisional license.\n\nA provisional license may come with fewer restrictions than a learner's permit, but it still may have conditions that the driver must follow. For example, there may be restrictions on the hours that the driver can drive, or there may be limitations on the types of vehicles that the driver can operate.\n\nSo while a provisional license and a learner's permit are related, they are not exactly the same thing. It's important to check with the specific driver licensing agency in your jurisdiction to understand the differences and requirements for each type of license.",

        "The eligibility of someone born on a military base, specifically in the context of the Panama Canal Zone, to be President of the United States, is a question that has been the subject of legal debate. John McCain, who was born on a military hospital in the Panama Canal Zone in 1936, faced such questions during his presidential campaign in 2008.\n\nThe Panama Canal Zone was not considered United States territory at the time of McCain's birth, but the U.S. Congress passed the Nationality Act of 1937 (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1403), which retroactively conferred U.S. citizenship on individuals born within the Canal Zone on or after February 26, 1904, and on individuals born in Panama on or after that date who had at least one U.S. citizen parent employed by the U.S. government or the Panama Railway Company.\n\nIn the context of McCain's eligibility for the presidency, there were differing opinions among legal scholars and politicians. Some argued that McCain was eligible by virtue of being a natural-born citizen from birth, as defined in the U.S. Constitution (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401), while others believed that he became a natural-born citizen retroactively through the Nationality Act of 1937 (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1403).\n\nIn 2008, former Solicitor General Ted Olson and Harvard Law Professor Laurence H. Tribe wrote a paper opining that McCain was eligible for the presidency based on the provisions of the U.S. Constitution and the Nationality Act of 1937. The U.S. Senate also approved a non-binding resolution recognizing McCain's status as a natural-born citizen.\n\nU.S. District Judge William Alsup, in a 2008 ruling, stated that it is \"highly probable\" that McCain is a natural-born citizen from birth, but also acknowledged the alternative possibility that McCain became a natural-born citizen retroactively.\n\nTherefore, while the question of someone born on a military base being eligible for the presidency is a complex legal issue, the available evidence suggests that, in the case of John McCain, he was considered a natural-born citizen by many legal experts and politicians, both due to his birth on U.S. soil and the retroactive conferral of U.S. citizenship through the Nationality Act of 1937.",
        "Yes, it is possible to checkmate an opponent with two bishops and a king in chess. This is known as a \"double bishop checkmate.\" However, it is a very rare and complex tactic that requires precise positioning of the bishops and the king on the board. It is much more common for a queen or a rook, along with a king, to deliver checkmate.",

        "No, the octet rule is not strictly applicable to all elements. It is primarily a rule of thumb for main-group elements, which includes most atoms in the s and p blocks of the periodic table. These elements tend to form stable compounds with electron configurations that resemble those of noble gases, which have a full valence shell of eight electrons.\n\nHowever, many exceptions exist. For instance, some elements in the d and f blocks, such as transition metals and lanthanides, form stable compounds with incomplete valence shells. Additionally, some main-group elements, such as hydrogen, nitrogen in its triple bonded state, and oxygen in its O2 molecule, can form stable compounds with fewer than eight valence electrons.\n\nMoreover, some exceptions to the octet rule can be found even among main-group elements. For example, some elements form anions with more than eight valence electrons, such as O2- (oxide ion), F- (fluoride ion), and ClO4- (perchlorate ion).\n\nSo, while the octet rule is a useful concept for understanding the chemical behavior of many elements, it is not an absolute rule and should be applied with caution.",
        "Yes, the prime minister of Canada is expected to be a member of the House of Commons. This is based on convention and the fact that the prime minister is answerable to and must maintain the support of the House of Commons.

Additionally, the litigation process and taping of the show are generally treated as an all-expense-paid vacation for the litigants and their witnesses.",
        "No, a runner cannot advance on a dead ball in baseball. When the ball is dead, all runners must freeze in their current base position and no new runners can be put out. The umpire will signal that the ball is dead, usually by throwing down the ball or dropping the third strike in the case of a strikeout, and all action on the field comes to a halt until the ball is live again. Once the ball is live, runners may resume advancing bases, but only if they are forced to do so due to a batted ball or a tag attempt by the defensive team.",

        "Yes, venom glands can be removed from a snake through a surgical procedure. However, it is important to note that this procedure is not without risks and complications. The venom glands and the duct connecting them to the fangs have been known to regenerate, which could potentially result in the snake being able to produce venom again. Additionally, the procedure itself can be invasive and may cause complications such as infection or damage to other organs. The ethical and legal implications of venomoid procedures are also a matter of debate.",
        "The sale of beer in grocery stores in New Jersey is significantly restricted due to a combination of state law and municipal ordinances. New Jersey law limits corporations to two retail distribution licenses, making it impractical for large chain stores to sell alcoholic beverages. As a result, supermarkets and convenience stores, which often sell beer in large quantities in other states, face significant barriers to doing so in New Jersey. Additionally, individual municipalities in New Jersey have the authority to define the scope of underage drinking laws, adding another layer of complexity to alcohol sales in the state. Therefore, while it is possible for some grocery stores in New Jersey to sell beer, the restrictions make it less common than in many other states.",
