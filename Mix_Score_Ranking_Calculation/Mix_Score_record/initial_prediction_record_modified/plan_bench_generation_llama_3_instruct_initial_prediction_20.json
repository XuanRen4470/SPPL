        "I'd be happy to help you solve the problem.\n\nFrom the initial conditions, we know that:\n\n* The red block is clear\n* The yellow block is clear\n* The hand is empty\n* The red block is on top of the blue block\n* The yellow block is on top of the orange block\n* The blue block is on the table\n* The orange block is on the table\n\nThe goal is to have the orange block on top of the red block.\n\nHere's a possible plan to achieve the goal:\n\n[PLAN]\npick up the yellow block\nunstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block\nput down the yellow block\npick up the orange block\nstack the orange block on top of the red block\n[PLAN END]\n\nHere's the reasoning behind the plan:\n\n1. Pick up the yellow block: Since the hand is empty, we can pick up the yellow block.\n2. Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block: Since the yellow block was on top of the orange block, we can unstack it.\n3. Put down the yellow block: Once we unstack the yellow block, we need to put it down to make space for the next action.\n4. Pick up the orange block: Now that the yellow block is no longer on top of the orange block, we can pick up the orange block.\n5. Stack the orange block on top of the red block: Finally, we can stack the orange block on top of the red block to achieve the goal.\n\nThis plan should work because:\n\n* We're only picking up or unstacking one block at a time\n* We're only putting down a block that we're holding\n* We're only stacking a block on top of another block if we're holding the block being stacked\n* We're only stacking a block on top of another block if the block onto which we're stacking is clear\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain further!\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up yellow)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-uporange)\n(stack orange red)\n(stack orange red)",
        "Let's analyze the initial conditions and the goal.\n\nInitial conditions:\n\n* Red block is clear\n* Hand is empty\n* Red block is on top of blue block\n* Blue block is on top of orange block\n* Orange block is on top of yellow block\n* Yellow block is on the table\n\nGoal:\n\n* Blue block is on top of orange block\n* Orange block is on top of yellow block\n* Yellow block is on top of red block\n\nSince the red block is clear, we can start by unstacking the blue block from on top of the red block. This will leave the red block on the table.\n\nPlan:\n\n1. Unstack the blue block from on top of the red block\n2. Put down the blue block\n3. Pick up the orange block\n4. Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block\n5. Put down the blue block\n6. Pick up the yellow block\n7. Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block\n8. Pick up the blue block\n9. Stack the blue block on top of the orange block\n10. Pick up the red block\n11. Stack the red block on top of the blue block\n\nThis plan achieves the goal by rearranging the blocks in the desired order.\n\nFinal Answer: (ustack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)"
