Then, we pick up the yellow block and stack it on top of the red block. Finally, we pick up the orange block again and stack it on top of the yellow block.\n\nSince we can only pick up or unstack one block at a time, we need to follow these steps in order to achieve the goal efficiently. We cannot directly stack the orange block on top of the red block because the red block is not clear (the yellow block is on top of it). Therefore, we need to first move the yellow block to the side (by stacking it on top of the red block) before we can stack the orange block on top of the red block.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack yellow red)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(stack yellow red)\n",
