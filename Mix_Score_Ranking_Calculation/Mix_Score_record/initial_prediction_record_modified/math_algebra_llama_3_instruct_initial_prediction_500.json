        "Let $g$ be the number of girls at the school, and $b$ be the number of boys at the school.  We know that $g+b=1200$, and that $\\frac{2}{3}g+\\frac{1}{2}b=730$.  We can solve this system of equations by first subtracting $\\frac{1}{2}b$ from both sides of the second equation, to get $\\frac{2}{3}g+\\frac{1}{2}b-\\frac{1}{2}b=\\frac{2}{3}g=730-\\frac{1}{2}b$.  Then, multiplying both sides of the equation by $\\frac{3}{2}$, we get $2g=730-\\frac{3}{2}b$.  Now, substituting $1200-b$ for $g$ in the equation $2g=730-\\frac{3}{2}b$, we get $2(1200-b)=730-\\frac{3}{2}b$.  Simplifying the equation, we get $2400-2b=730-\\frac{3}{2}b$.  Adding $\\frac{3}{2}b$ to both sides of the equation, we get $2400-2b+\\frac{3}{2}b=730$.  Then, simplifying, we get $2400-2b+\\frac{3}{2}b=730$, or $2400-\\frac{1}{2}b=730$.  Finally, adding $\\frac{1}{2}b$ to both sides of the equation, we get $2400=730+\\frac{1}{2}b$.  Subtracting 730 from both sides of the equation, we get $1670=\\frac{1}{2}b$.  Multiplying both sides of the equation by 2, we get $3340=b$.  Now, substituting $3340$ for $b$ in the equation $g+b=1200$, we get $g+3340=1200$.  Subtracting 3340 from both sides of the equation, we get $g=1200-3340=-2140$.  Since we cannot have a negative number of girls, we know that this is incorrect.

Similarly, if we subtract the second equation from the third, we get $ac-bc = 0$.  Adding this to the previous equation, we get $2ab+2ac = 2bc$, so $ab+ac = bc$.

        "From the first equation, we know that $c + o = u$.  From the last equation, we know that $o + n + s = 12$.  Subtracting the first equation from the last equation, we have $n + s - u = 12 - c - o = 12 - (c + o) = 12 - u$.  Adding $u$ to both sides, we have $n + s = 12$.  From the second equation, we know that $u + n = t$.  Subtracting the second equation from the last equation, we have $s - t = 12 - (u + n) = 12 - t$.  Adding $t$ to both sides, we have $s = 12$.  From the third equation, we know that $t + c = s$.  Plugging in $s = 12$, we have $t + c = 12$.  Subtracting $c$ from both sides, we have $t = 12 - c$.  Substituting this into the second equation, we have $u + n = 12 - c$.  From the first equation, we know that $c + o = u$.  Subtracting $c + o$ from both sides, we have $n = 12 - c - o$.  From the first equation, we know that $c + o = u$.  Substituting this into $n = 12 - c - o$, we have $n = 12 - c - (c + o) = 12 - 2c - o$.  Adding $2c + o$ to both sides, we have $n + 2c + o = 12$.  Since $n + s = 12$, we know that $o = 12 - s = 12 - 12 = 0$.  Since $o = 0$, we know that $c + o = u = c + 0 = c$.  Since $c = u$, we know that $n = 12 - c - o = 12 - c - 0 = 12 - c$.  From the second equation, we know that $u + n = t$.  Substituting $c$ for $u$ and $12 - c$ for $n$, we have $c + (12 - c) = t$.  Simplifying the left side, we have $12 = t$.  Therefore, $t = \\boxed{2}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 2. I hope it is correct.",

        "Let's denote the length of the rectangular tennis court as L and the width as W. Since Tiffany must use exactly 300 feet of fencing, the perimeter of the court is 300 feet. The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides, which is 2L + 2W. Setting this equal to 300, we get:\n\n2L + 2W = 300\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nL + W = 150\n\nSince the length of the fence enclosure must be at least 80 feet and the width must be at least 40 feet, we can set up the following inequalities:\n\nL \u2265 80\nW \u2265 40\n\nWe want to find the maximum area of the court, which is given by the formula:\n\nArea = L \u00d7 W\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let's define the function we want to maximize:\n\nf(L, W) = L \u00d7 W\n\nAnd the constraint equation:\n\ng(L, W) = L + W - 150 = 0\n\nTaking the partial derivatives of f and g with respect to L and W, we get:\n\n\u2202f/\u2202L = W\n\u2202f/\u2202W = L\n\u2202g/\u2202L = 1\n\u2202g/\u2202W = 1\n\nUsing the method of Lagrange multipliers, we set up the following system of equations:\n\nW = \u03bb\nL = \u03bb\n1 = \u03bb\n1 = \u03bb\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nL = W = 85\n\nSubstituting these values back into the original equation L + W = 150, we get:\n\n85 + 85 = 170 \u2260 150\n\nThis means that the solution L = W = 85 does not satisfy the constraint equation. To find the maximum area, we need to find the values of L and W that satisfy the constraint equation.\n\nSince L + W = 150, we can write W = 150 - L. Substituting this into the area formula, we get:\n\nArea = L \u00d7 (150 - L)\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of the area with respect to L and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Area)/dL = 150 - 2L = 0\n\nSolving for L, we get:\n\nL = 75\n\nSubstituting this value back into the equation L + W = 150, we get:\n\nW = 75\n\nThe maximum area is therefore:\n\nArea = L \u00d7 W = 75 \u00d7 75 = 5625 square feet",

Simplifying this, we obtain $2ab+10a=72-3b+222$, or $2ab+10a=294-3b$. Adding $3b$ to both sides, we obtain $2ab+13a=294$, or $2ab+13a-13a=294-13a$, so $2ab=294-13a$. Dividing both sides by 2, we obtain $ab=\\frac{294-13a}{2}$. We know that $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, so $ab$ must be an integer. This means that $294-13a$ must be even. If $a$ is odd, then $294-13a$ is odd, so $ab$ is not an integer. Therefore, $a$ must be even. The only even values of $a$ that satisfy $a+b=24$ are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24.

If $a=8$, then $b=16$, so $ab=128$. If $a=10$, then $b=14$, so $ab=140$. If $a=12$, then $b=12$, so $ab=144$. If $a=14$, then $b=10$, so $ab=140$. If $a=16$, then $b=8$, so $ab=128$. If $a=18$, then $b=6$, so $ab=108$. If $a=20$, then $b=4$, so $ab=80$. If $a=22$, then $b=2$, so $ab=44$. If $a=24$, then $b=0$, so $ab=0$. The only values of $a$ that give an integer value of $ab$ are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24.

        "Let $g$ be the weight of a green ball, $b$ the weight of a blue ball, $y$ the weight of a yellow ball, and $w$ the weight of a white ball.  From the first condition, we know that $3g=6b$.  From the second, we know that $2y=5b$.  From the third, we know that $6b=4w$.  Substituting the third condition into the second gives us $2y=\\frac{4}{3}w$, so $y=\\frac{2}{3}w$.  Substituting this into the first condition, we get $3g=6b$, so $g=2b$.

Squaring both sides, we get $45+(d+3)^2 = 9d^2$. Subtracting 45 from both sides, we get $(d+3)^2 = 9d^2-45$. Subtracting $9d^2$ from both sides, we get $-(8d^2+(d+3)^2) = -45$. So, $8d^2+(d+3)^2 = 45$. We can rewrite this as $(8d^2+(d+3)^2)-45 = 0$. Factoring the left hand side, we get $(8d^2+d^2+6d+9)-45 = 0$. This becomes $9d^2+6d-36 = 0$.

        "We have\n\n$$2x^2 - 5x - 4 = 0 \\Rightarrow 2x^2 - 5x + \\frac{25}{4} - \\frac{25}{4} - 4 = 0 \\Rightarrow \\left(x - \\frac{5}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{8}.$$This means that the roots are $$x = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{9}}{4} = \\frac{5 \\pm 3}{4} = \\frac{2}{4}, \\frac{8}{4}.$$The answer is $\\boxed{9}$.",
        "To find the minimum value of the function $2x^2 - 12x + 3$, we can start by completing the square:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2x^2 - 12x + 3 &= 2(x^2 - 6x) + 3 \\\\\n&= 2(x^2 - 6x + 9) - 18 + 3 \\\\\n&= 2(x-3)^2 - 15.\n\\end{align*}This shows that the function is equal to $2(x-3)^2 - 15$ for all $x$. Since $2(x-3)^2 \\ge 0$ for all $x$, the minimum value of the function is $-15$ and it occurs when $x = \\boxed{3}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct."
