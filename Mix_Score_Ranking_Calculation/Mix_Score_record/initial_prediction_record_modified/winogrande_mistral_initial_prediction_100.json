        "Option 1: Ian\n\nExplanation:\nThe sentence states that \"Ian volunteered to eat Dennis's menudo after already having a bowl because he despised eating intestine.\" This means that Ian did not like eating intestines but still chose to eat Dennis's menudo (which contains intestines) a second time. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 1: Ian.",
        "Based on the information provided in the question, the correct answer is Option 1: Ian. The reason is that the question states that \"Ian volunteered to eat Dennis's menudo after already having a bowl because he enjoyed eating intestine.\" This indicates that Ian is the one who enjoys eating intestine and willingly ate Dennis's menudo a second time because of that enjoyment.",
        "The correct answer is: Option 2: house.\n\nThe reason is that the sentence states \"the [blank] is smaller,\" and the smaller entity in this context is the house of the person that the speaker does not visit at their home.",
        "The correct answer is: Option 2: house.\n\nThe reason is that the blank in the sentence is referring to the size of one specific house, not a home in general. Therefore, the correct answer is \"house.\"",
        "Based on the information provided in the question, it is more likely that Logan lives in a colder climate. Since Logan wears leg warmers to bed almost always, it suggests that he may need extra warmth to keep himself comfortable during sleep. Therefore, Option 2, Logan, is the correct answer.",

        "The question states that the speaker got lost and then was able to navigate home with the help of a GPS and a map. Therefore, neither the GPS nor the map could have been turned upside down during this time, as they are not physical objects that can be rotated in such a way. Thus, neither Option 1 nor Option 2 is correct.\n\nIt is more likely that the speaker encountered some sort of issue with the directions on the map or the GPS device itself, rather than the map or GPS being physically turned upside down. The question may be missing important context that would help clarify the situation.",
        "Option 1: GPS. The GPS provides real-time navigation assistance, while the map is a static representation of the area. Therefore, losing the GPS signal would make it harder to navigate, while turning off the map would not have the same effect.",
        "Neither option is correct as there is no information given about who was on the ramp.",
        "Neither option is provided in the given text. The text only mentions Emily and Patricia, but it does not specify who was under the ramp. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the answer based on the information given.",
        "The blank in the given question should be filled with the word \"trolley\" for the sentence to make complete sense.

        "The correct answer is Option 1: route. The sentence is saying that the scenic route to the store was under construction, so the word that fits best in the blank is \"route.\"",
        "The correct answer is Option 1: route. In this context, the \"scenic route\" is a specific route that the person intended to take, so the blank should be filled with a word that refers to a route or a path. The store is not the blank because the issue is not that the store was not open, but rather that the route to get there was closed early.",
        "The correct answer is Option 1: chair. The context of the passage indicates that the person was previously annoyed with dusting her wood chair, so it's the cleaning task that has been replaced by a more convenient option (a plastic table).",

        "The correct answer is Option 2: conscious.\n\nExplanation: Behavioral biases refer to systematic errors in thinking and decision-making that result in inconsistent or illogical actions. These biases can manifest both consciously and unconsciously. However, the question asks which actions we should focus on changing to overcome behavioral biases. The answer is conscious actions because they are voluntary and under our control. Unconscious actions, on the other hand, are not under our conscious control and are influenced by subconscious processes. Therefore, it is generally more challenging to change unconscious actions compared to conscious actions.",
        "The correct answer is Option 1: unconscious. Behavioural biases are typically considered to be unconscious or automatic, meaning they occur outside of our conscious awareness and control. Therefore, to overcome them, it is generally more effective to focus on changing conscious actions, as these are the actions that we have conscious control over. However, the question states that we need to focus less on unconscious actions, which is incorrect. The correct statement would be that we need to focus more on changing conscious actions to overcome behavioural biases.",
        "Based on the information provided in the question, Option 1: Megan, has a lot less money than Jessica. Therefore, the blank should be filled with \"Megan\" lost the lottery money.
