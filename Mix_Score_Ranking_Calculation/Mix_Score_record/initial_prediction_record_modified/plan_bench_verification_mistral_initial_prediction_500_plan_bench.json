By following this sequence of actions, we will eventually reach the goal state where the red block is on top of the yellow block, and the blue block is on top of the orange block.",

This is necessary because the goal requires the red block to be a base block, and it cannot be a base block while it is on top of another block.\n\nIn the fourth step, the blue block is unstacked from the table and stacked on top of the orange block. This is necessary to achieve the goal of having the blue block on top of the orange block.\n\nIn the fifth step, the orange block is picked up and stacked on top of the red block.

The fifth and sixth actions are to put down the orange block and put down the blue block, respectively. These actions are valid because the hand is empty and both blocks are clear.\n\n7. The seventh action is to put down the red block. This action is valid because the hand is empty and the red block is clear.\n\n8.
