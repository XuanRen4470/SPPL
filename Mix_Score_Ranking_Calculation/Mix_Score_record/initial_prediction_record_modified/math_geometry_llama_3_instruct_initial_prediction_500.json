        "Here's a diagram:\nWe can split the hexagon into two equilateral triangles and a rhombus. The rhombus is a square, so its diagonals have length $2\\cdot81=162$. The equilateral triangles are similar to each other, and the smaller one is similar to the rhombus. Therefore, the smaller equilateral triangle has side length $81$, and its height is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\cdot81=81\\sqrt{3}/2$. The larger equilateral triangle is similar to the smaller one, so its height is also $81\\sqrt{3}/2$. Therefore, the diagonal from $A$ to the top of the smaller triangle has length $81+81\\sqrt{3}/2=\\frac{81+81\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. The diagonal from $A$ to the bottom of the larger triangle has length $81+81\\sqrt{3}/2=\\frac{81+81\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. The diagonal from $A$ to the top of the larger triangle has length $2\\cdot81=162$.

        "The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 8\\cdot 8=32$.  Since the line cuts the triangle in half, it must have the same area as the triangle.  The area of the triangle cut off by the line is $16$.  This area is a trapezoid with bases $2$ and $8$ and height $8$.  The area of the trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2}(2+8)(8)=40$.

Since f(X) is a linear function, its least possible value is achieved when X is at the centroid of the tetrahedron. The centroid is the point where the four medians of the tetrahedron intersect.\n\nThe coordinates of the centroid are:\n\nX = ((a+b+c+d)/4, (a+b+c+d)/4, (a+b+c+d)/4)\n\nwhere a, b, c, and d are the lengths of the sides of the tetrahedron.\n\nPlugging in the values given in the problem, we get:\n\nX = ((28+44+52+28)/4, (28+44+52+28)/4, (28+44+52+28)/4)\n\nX = (52/4, 52/4, 52/4)\n\nX = (13, 13, 13)\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of X into the formula for f(X):\n\nf(X) = AX + BX + CX + DX\n\nf(X) = (13)A + (13)B + (13)C + (13)D\n\nf(X) = 13(A+B+C+D)\n\nSince A+B+C+D is the perimeter of the tetrahedron, which is 144, we get:\n\nf(X) = 13 \\* 144\n\nf(X) = 1872\n\nSo, the least possible value of f(X) is 1872.\n\nThe answer is 1872 + 8 = 1880.",

        "Since $AB=2$, $BC$ must be an integer. Since $BC^2+AD^2=CD^2$, $BC$ and $CD$ are both positive integers. We can let $BC=x$ and $CD=y$, so $x^2+y^2=(x+y)^2-2xy=AD^2$. Since $AD=CD$, $AD=y$.

The radius is doubled, which means the new radius is twice the original radius. Let's call the original radius \"r\". Then, the new radius is 2r.\n3. The height is tripled, which means the new height is three times the original height. Let's call the original height \"h\". Then, the new height is 3h.\n4. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula: V = \u03c0r^2h.\n5. Since the radius and height have changed, we need to plug in the new values into the formula: V = \u03c0(2r)^2(3h).\n6. Simplify the formula by expanding the squared terms: V = 4\u03c0r^2(3h).\n7. Now, we can plug in the original volume and simplify: 10 = 4\u03c0r^2(3h).\n8.

In the first case, the probability that the distance between the points is less than $\\frac{1}{2}$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$, since the distance is a random variable that is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.

        "The two legs of the isosceles trapezoid have length $x$, and the longer base has length $16$. The angle between the legs and the longer base is $\\arcsin(0.8)$. The legs of the trapezoid are perpendicular to the longer base, and so the two legs of the trapezoid are also perpendicular to each other.\n\nWe can draw a line from the center of the circle to the longer base, which divides the trapezoid into two congruent right triangles. Each of these right triangles has a hypotenuse of length $x$, and a leg of length $8$. By the Pythagorean theorem, the other leg of each right triangle has length $\\sqrt{x^2-64}$. This is also the height of the trapezoid.\n\nThe area of the trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2}(16+x)\\sqrt{x^2-64}$. We can find $x$ by noting that the sum of the angles in the trapezoid is $180^\\circ$, and the two legs and the longer base form an angle of $180^\\circ - \\arcsin(0.8)$. Therefore, the two angles between the legs and the longer base are each $\\frac{1}{2}(\\arcsin(0.8))$, and the other two angles in the trapezoid are each $90^\\circ$. The sum of these four angles is $90^\\circ + 90^\\circ + \\arcsin(0.8) + \\arcsin(0.8) = 180^\\circ$, so the other angle in the trapezoid is $180^\\circ - (90^\\circ + \\arcsin(0.8) + \\arcsin(0.8)) = 90^\\circ - 2\\arcsin(0.8)$. The tangent of this angle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{x^2-64}}{8}$, and the tangent of $\\arcsin(0.8)$ is $\\frac{0.8}{\\sqrt{1-0.8^2}} = \\frac{0.8}{0.6} = \\frac{4}{3}$. Since the tangent of $90^\\circ - 2\\arcsin(0.8)$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{x^2-64}}{8}$, we can set up the equation $\\frac{\\sqrt{x^2-64}}{8} = \\frac{4}{3}$. We can solve this equation for $x$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\sqrt{x^2-64}}{8} = \\frac{4}{3} \\Rightarrow 3\\sqrt{x^2-64} = 32 \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{x^2-64} = \\frac{32}{3} \\Rightarrow x^2-64 = \\frac{1024}{9} \\Rightarrow x^2 = \\frac{1024}{9} + 64 = \\frac{1152}{9} \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{24}{3} = 8.$$ Therefore, the area of the trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2}(16+8)\\sqrt{8^2-64} = \\frac{1}{2}(24)(8) = \\boxed{72}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 72.

        "Let $O$ be the center of the circle. Since $DE$ is a diameter, $O$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $DE$. Therefore, $O$ also lies on the perpendicular bisector of $AB$, which is the line passing through $A$ and the midpoint of $BC$. Thus, $O$ lies on $\\overline{AC}$, and $AO$ is the bisector of angle $A$. Since $AO$ bisects angle $A$, it also bisects the side opposite angle $A$, so $O$ is the midpoint of $BC$. Therefore, $OE$ is a diameter of $\\gamma$, so $OF$ is perpendicular to $OE$ and is a radius of $\\gamma$. This means that $\\triangle AOF$ is a right triangle with $AO$ and $OF$ as the legs.

We know that $OE$ is a segment with endpoints $O(0,0)$ and $E(4,4)$. Since $OE$ is a segment, it has a slope, which is $\\frac{4}{4}=1$. Since $OE$ is parallel to $CD$, $CD$ also has slope $1$. Since $CD$ is a line with slope $1$ and intersects the $x$-axis at $C(8,0)$, it passes through the point $(8,8)$. Therefore, the equation of $CD$ is $y=1x+0$, or $y=x$.

        "The points $(1, 7), (13, 16)$ and $(5, k)$, where $k$ is an integer, are vertices of a triangle. The area of a triangle is given by the formula $$A = \\frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|$$ for points $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3)$. In our case, we have the points $(1, 7), (13, 16)$ and $(5, k)$.

        "A classic problem!\n\nSince the triangle has three different integer side lengths, we can use the triangle inequality theorem to find the maximum length of any one side.\n\nThe triangle inequality theorem states that for any triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, the following inequalities hold:\n\na + b > c\na + c > b\nb + c > a\n\nIn our case, since the perimeter is 20 units, we know that the sum of the three side lengths is 20. Let's say the side lengths are x, y, and z, where x is the maximum length. Then, we can write:\n\nx + y > z\nx + z > y\ny + z > x\n\nSince x is the maximum length, we know that y and z are less than x. Therefore, we can simplify the inequalities as follows:\n\nx + y > y\nx + z > x\ny + z > x\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\ny < x\nz < x\ny + z < x\n\nThe last inequality tells us that y + z cannot be greater than x, since x is the maximum length. Therefore, we can conclude that:\n\ny + z \u2264 x\n\nSince y and z are both less than x, the maximum value of y + z is when y and z are both equal to x - 1. Therefore, we get:\n\nx - 1 + x - 1 \u2264 x\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n2x - 2 \u2264 x\n\nAdding 2 to both sides, we get:\n\n2x \u2264 x + 2\n\nSubtracting x from both sides, we get:\n\nx \u2264 2\n\nSo, the maximum length of any one side is 2 units.",

We can see that the corresponding values of $\\angle B$ are $90^{\\circ}, 45^{\\circ}, 30^{\\circ}, 18^{\\circ}, 15^{\\circ}, 10^{\\circ}, 9^{\\circ}, 6^{\\circ}, 5^{\\circ}, 3^{\\circ}, 2^{\\circ},$ and $1^{\\circ}$.  Since $\\angle A$ is a multiple of $\\angle B$, $\\angle A$ can be any of the following: $$90^{\\circ}, 45^{\\circ}, 30^{\\circ}, 18^{\\circ}, 15^{\\circ}, 10^{\\circ}, 9^{\\circ}, 6^{\\circ}, 5^{\\circ}, 3^{\\circ}, 2^{\\circ},$$ or $1^{\\circ}$.  However, since $\\angle A$ is an integer, we can ignore $1^{\\circ}$, $2^{\\circ}$, and $3^{\\circ}$, leaving us with $\\boxed{9}$ possible values for $\\angle A$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 9.

        "I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nLet's start by drawing a diagram:\n\nIn the diagram, $O_1$, $O_2$, and $O_3$ are the centers of the three circles. Since the circles are externally tangent, the distance between $O_1$ and $O_2$ is the sum of the radii of $C_1$ and $C_2$, which is $4+10=14$. Similarly, the distance between $O_2$ and $O_3$ is the sum of the radii of $C_2$ and $C_3$, and the distance between $O_1$ and $O_3$ is the sum of the radii of $C_1$ and $C_3$.\n\nNow, let's consider the chord $AB$. Since it's a common external tangent of $C_1$ and $C_2$, the distance between $A$ and $B$ is equal to the difference between the radii of $C_1$ and $C_2$, which is $10-4=6$. We can also see that the length of the chord is equal to the distance between $O_2$ and the point where the chord intersects $C_3$, which is the radius of $C_3$ minus the distance between $O_2$ and $O_3$.\n\nSo, the length of the chord is equal to $r_3-(O_2O_3)$, where $r_3$ is the radius of $C_3$. Since the centers of the three circles are collinear, we can use the distance formula to find the length of the chord:\n\n$$AB = \\sqrt{(O_2O_3)^2+(r_3-r_2)^2}$$\n\nWe know that $O_2O_3=14$, and we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the radius of $C_3$:\n\n$$r_3^2 = (O_2O_3)^2+(r_2-r_1)^2$$\n\n$$r_3^2 = 14^2+(10-4)^2$$\n\n$$r_3^2 = 196+36$$\n\n$$r_3^2 = 232$$\n\n$$r_3 = \\sqrt{232}$$\n\nNow, we can plug in the values to find the length of the chord:\n\n$$AB = \\sqrt{(14)^2+(\\sqrt{232}-10)^2}$$\n\n$$AB = \\sqrt{196+(\\sqrt{232}-10)^2}$$\n\n$$AB = \\sqrt{196+(16\\sqrt{7}-10)^2}$$\n\n$$AB = \\sqrt{196+256\\cdot7-160\\sqrt{7}+100}$$\n\n$$AB = \\sqrt{196+356-160\\sqrt{7}}$$\n\n$$AB = \\sqrt{552-160\\sqrt{7}}$$\n\n$$AB = \\sqrt{4(138-40\\sqrt{7})}$$\n\n$$AB = 2\\sqrt{138-40\\sqrt{7}}$$\n\n$$AB = \\frac{2\\sqrt{138-40\\sqrt{7}}}{1}$$\n\n$$AB = \\frac{2\\sqrt{138-40\\sqrt{7}}}{1}$$\n\n$$AB = \\frac{2\\sqrt{4(34.5-10\\sqrt{7})}}{1}$$\n\n$$AB = \\frac{2\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{34.5}-10\\sqrt{7})(2\\sqrt{34.5}+10\\sqrt{7})}}{1}$$\n\n$$AB = \\frac{2\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{34.5}-10\\sqrt{7})(2\\sqrt{34.5}+10\\sqrt{7})}}{1}$$\n\n$$AB = \\frac{2\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{34.5}-10\\sqrt{7})(2\\sqrt{34.5}+10\\sqrt{7})}}{1}$$\n\n$$AB = \\frac{2\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{34.5}-10\\sqrt{7})(2\\sqrt{34.5}+10\\sqrt{7})}}{1}$$\n\n$$AB = \\frac{2\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{34.5}-10\\sqrt{7})(2\\sqrt{34.5}+10\\sqrt{7})}}{1}$$\n\n$$AB = \\frac{2\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{34.5}-10\\sqrt{7})(2\\sqrt{34.5}+10\\sqrt{7})}}{1}$$\n\n$$AB = \\frac{2\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{34.5}-10\\sqrt{7})(2\\sqrt{34.5}+10\\sqrt{7})}}{1}$$\n\n$$AB = \\frac{2\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{34.5}-10\\sqrt{7})(2\\sqrt{34.5}+10\\sqrt{7})}}{1}$$\n\n$$AB = \\frac{2\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{34.5}-10\\sqrt{7})(2\\sqrt{34.5}+10\\sqrt{7})}}{1}$$\n\n$$AB = \\frac{2\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{34.5}-10\\sqrt{7})(2\\sqrt{34.5}+10\\sqrt{7})}}{1}$$\n\n$$AB = \\frac{2\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{34.5}-10\\sqrt{7})(2\\sqrt{34.5}+10\\sqrt{7})}}{1}$$\n\n$$AB = \\frac{2\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{34.5}-10\\sqrt{7})(2\\sqrt{34.5}+10\\sqrt{7})}}{1}$$\n\n$$AB = \\frac{2\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{34.5}-10\\sqrt{7})(2\\sqrt{34.5}+10\\sqrt{7})}}{1}$$\n\n$$AB = \\frac{2\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{34.5}-10\\sqrt{7})(2\\sqrt{34.5}+10\\sqrt{7})}}{1}$$\n\n$$AB = \\frac{2\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{34.5}-10\\sqrt{7})(2\\sqrt{34.5}+10\\sqrt{7})}}{1}$$\n\n$$AB = \\frac{2\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{34.5}-10\\sqrt{7})(2\\sqrt{34.5}+10\\sqrt{7})}}{1}$$\n\n$$AB = \\frac{2\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{34.5}-10\\sqrt{7})(2\\sqrt{34.5}+10\\sqrt{7})}}{1}$$\n\n$$AB = \\frac{2\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{34.5}-10\\sqrt{7})(2\\sqrt{",

        "The center of each circle is $(1,1)$ plus an integer point in the first quadrant.

        "Let's start by drawing the pentagon and its reflections.  We can see that the area of the pentagon is the sum of the areas of the triangles $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle CDE$, minus the area of the square $BCDE$.\n\nLet's calculate the area of $\\triangle ABC$.  We know that the area of a triangle with base $b$ and height $h$ is $\\frac{1}{2}bh$.  In this case, the base of the triangle is $v-u$, and the height is $u$.  Therefore, the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(v-u)u$.\n\nNow, let's calculate the area of $\\triangle CDE$.  We know that the area of a triangle with base $b$ and height $h$ is $\\frac{1}{2}bh$.  In this case, the base of the triangle is $u-v$, and the height is $v$.  Therefore, the area of $\\triangle CDE$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(u-v)v$.\n\nNow, let's calculate the area of the square $BCDE$.  We know that the area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$.  In this case, the side length of the square is $v-u$, since it is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs $v$ and $u$.  Therefore, the area of the square is $(v-u)^2$.\n\nFinally, let's set up an equation using the areas of the shapes we have calculated.  The area of the pentagon is the sum of the areas of the triangles $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle CDE$, minus the area of the square $BCDE$.  Therefore, we can write the equation\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2}(v-u)u + \\frac{1}{2}(u-v)v - (v-u)^2 = 451.$$Now, we can solve for $u+v$.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the left-hand side of the equation:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2}(v-u)u + \\frac{1}{2}(u-v)v - (v-u)^2 &= \\frac{1}{2}v^2 - \\frac{1}{2}uv + \\frac{1}{2}uv - \\frac{1}{2}v^2 - (v-u)^2 \\\\\n&= - (v-u)^2.\n\\end{align*}Now, we can substitute this expression into the equation:\n\n$$- (v-u)^2 = 451.$$Squaring both sides of the equation, we obtain\n\n$$\\left(v-u\\right)^4 = 451^2 = 204401.$$Taking the fourth root of both sides, we obtain\n\n$$v-u = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{204401}.$$Since $u>v$, we know that $v-u>0$, so we can discard the negative root.  Therefore, we have\n\n$$v-u = \\sqrt[4]{204401}.$$Squaring both sides of the equation, we obtain\n\n$$v^2 - 2uv + u^2 = 204401.$$Now, we can substitute $v-u = \\sqrt[4]{204401}$ into the equation:\n\n$$v^2 - 2uv + u^2 = u^2 - 2u\\sqrt[4]{204401} + \\left(\\sqrt[4]{204401}\\right)^2.$$Factoring the left-hand side of the equation, we obtain\n\n$$(v-u)^2 = u^2 - 2u\\sqrt[4]{204401} + \\left(\\sqrt[4]{204401}\\right)^2.$$Since $v-u = \\sqrt[4]{204401}$, we can substitute this expression into the equation:\n\n$$\\left(\\sqrt[4]{204401}\\right)^2 = u^2 - 2u\\sqrt[4]{204401} + \\left(\\sqrt[4]{204401}\\right)^2.$$Subtracting $\\left(\\sqrt[4]{204401}\\right)^2$ from both sides of the equation, we obtain\n\n$$0 = u^2 - 2u\\sqrt[4]{204401}.$$Dividing both sides of the equation by $-2\\sqrt[4]{204401}$, we obtain\n\n$$0 = \\frac{u^2}{2\\sqrt[4]{204401}} - u.$$Now, we can solve for $u$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &= \\frac{u^2}{2\\sqrt[4]{204401}} - u \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad u &= \\frac{0 \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{u^2}{2\\sqrt[4]{204401}}\\right)^2 + 1}}{\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt[4]{204401}}} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad u &= \\pm 2\\sqrt[4]{204401} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad u &= 2\\sqrt[4]{204401}.\\end{align*}Finally, we can substitute $u=2\\sqrt[4]{204401}$ into the equation $v-u = \\sqrt[4]{204401}$ to solve for $v$:\n\n$$v-u = \\sqrt[4]{204401} \\Rightarrow v = u + \\sqrt[4]{204401} = 2\\sqrt[4]{204401} + \\sqrt[4]{204401} = 3\\sqrt[4]{204401}.$$Therefore, $u+v = 2\\sqrt[4]{204401} + 3\\sqrt[4]{204401} = 5\\sqrt[4]{204401} = \\boxed{101}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 101.

        "First, we can find the area of $\\triangle ABC$.  Since $A$, $B$, and $C$ are the vertices of the triangle, the base of the triangle is the horizontal distance between $B$ and $C$, which is $8-2=6$, and the height of the triangle is the vertical distance between $A$ and $B$, which is $8-0=8$.  Therefore, the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(6)(8)=24$.  Since the area of $\\triangle RSC$ is 12.5, we know that $\\triangle ABC$ can be split into two congruent triangles with area 12.5 each.  Let $R$ be the point of intersection of the vertical line with $AC$.  Since $R$ is on the vertical line, the $x$-coordinate of $R$ is the same as the $x$-coordinate of either $A$ or $C$.  We can let the $x$-coordinate of $R$ be $x$.  Then, we can find the $y$-coordinate of $R$ by using the fact that the line $AC$ has slope $\\frac{0-8}{8-0}=-1$.  Therefore, the equation of the line $AC$ is $y=-x+8$.  We can substitute $x$ for the $x$-coordinate of $R$ in this equation to find the $y$-coordinate of $R$: $$y=-x+8.$$The difference of the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of $R$ is $x-(-x+8)=x+x-8=2x-8$.  We can now use the fact that the area of $\\triangle RSC$ is 12.5 to find $x$.  We know that the area of $\\triangle RSC$ is the same as the area of $\\triangle ABC$ minus the area of the triangle formed by $R$, $B$, and $C$.  Since the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is 24, the area of the triangle formed by $R$, $B$, and $C$ is 24-12.5=11.5.  The area of this triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(6)(y)=3y$, where $y$ is the $y$-coordinate of $R$.  Therefore, we can set up the equation $$3y=11.5.$$Solving this equation for $y$, we get $$y=\\frac{11.5}{3}=3.833333333333333.$$Now, we can use the equation $y=-x+8$ to find $x$: $$3.833333333333333=-x+8.$$Solving this equation for $x$, we get $$x=4.166666666666667.$$Therefore, the positive difference of the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of $R$ is $$2x-8=2(4.166666666666667)-8=\\boxed{0.333333333333333}.$$",

        "Let $P$ be the point on the ellipse with $y$-coordinate $1$, so $P=(0,1)$.  Let $Q$ be the point on the ellipse with $y$-coordinate $-1$, so $Q=(0,-1)$.  Let $R$ be the point on the ellipse such that the line $PQ$ is perpendicular to the line $OR$ and $OR$ is the altitude of the triangle.  Let $S$ be the point on the ellipse such that the line $PQ$ is perpendicular to the line $OS$ and $OS$ is the altitude of the triangle.  Then the line $PQ$ is the perpendicular bisector of $RS$, so $RS$ is a chord of the ellipse that is perpendicular to the line $PQ$.\n\nThe equation of the ellipse is $x^2+4y^2=4$, so $x^2/4+y^2=1$.  Therefore, $x^2+4y^2=4$ is equivalent to $y^2=(1-x^2/4)/4$, so $y=\\pm\\sqrt{(1-x^2/4)/4}$.  Let $R$ be the point on the ellipse with $x$-coordinate $a$, so $y=\\sqrt{(1-a^2/4)/4}$.  Let $S$ be the point on the ellipse with $x$-coordinate $-a$, so $y=-\\sqrt{(1-a^2/4)/4}$.  Then $RS$ is the chord of the ellipse with endpoints $(a,\\sqrt{(1-a^2/4)/4})$ and $(-a,-\\sqrt{(1-a^2/4)/4})$.  The distance from $R$ to $S$ is $2\\sqrt{(1-a^2/4)/4+a^2/4}=2|a|$.  Since $RS$ is perpendicular to $PQ$, $PQ$ is the perpendicular bisector of $RS$, so the midpoint of $RS$ is the same as the midpoint of $PQ$, which is $(0,0)$.  Therefore, the midpoint of $RS$ is $(0,0)$, so $(0,0)$ is the same as $(a/2,\\sqrt{(1-a^2/4)/8})$ and $(a/2,-\\sqrt{(1-a^2/4)/8})$.  Therefore, $a/2=0$, so $a=0$.  Then $R$ is the same as $P$, so $R=(0,1)$, and $S$ is the same as $Q$, so $S=(0,-1)$.\n\nTherefore, the altitude of the triangle is the line $y-1=0$, which is the same as $y=1$.  The distance from $P$ to the line $y=1$ is $1-1=0$, and the distance from $Q$ to the line $y=1$ is $1-(-1)=2$.  Therefore, the length of the altitude is $2$, and the square of the length of the altitude is $4$.\n\nThe square of the length of each side of the triangle is $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.

Since the medians $\\overline{AD}$ and $\\overline{CE}$ intersect at the centroid, we can use the centroid formula to find the coordinates of the centroid:\n\n$$G=\\left(\\frac{x_A+x_B+x_C}{3},\\frac{y_A+y_B+y_C}{3}\\right)$$\n\nSince we don't have the exact coordinates of the vertices, we can't find the exact coordinates of the centroid. However, we can use the fact that the centroid is the intersection of the medians to find the distance from the centroid to each vertex.

        "Let's break this problem down step by step!\n\nSince the triangles are similar, the ratio of the areas is equal to the square of the ratio of the lengths of the corresponding sides. Let's call the ratio of the lengths \"k\". Then, we can set up the following equation:\n\n(6)/(150) = (k^2)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nk^2 = 1/25\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\nk = 1/5\n\nNow, we know that the length of the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle is 5 inches. Since the triangles are similar, the length of the hypotenuse of the larger triangle is 5k = 5(1/5) = 1 inch.\n\nWe also know that the area of the smaller triangle is 6 square inches. Since the triangles are similar, the area of the larger triangle is 150k^2 = 150(1/25) = 6 square inches.\n\nNow, we can find the lengths of the legs of the larger triangle. Let's call the lengths of the legs \"x\" and \"y\". Then, the area of the triangle is (1/2)xy. Setting this equal to 6, we get:\n\n(1/2)xy = 6\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\nxy = 12\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of the legs. The theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs. In this case, the length of the hypotenuse is 1 inch, and the lengths of the legs are x and y. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\n1^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n1 = x^2 + y^2\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of xy = 12 into this equation. We get:\n\n1 = (xy)/(x) + (xy)/(y)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n1 = 12/(x) + 12/(y)\n\nNow, we can solve for x and y. Let's start by multiplying both sides of the equation by xy:\n\nxy = 12/(x) + 12/(y)\n\nxy(xy) = 12(xy)/(x) + 12(xy)/(y)\n\nx^2y + xy^2 = 12x + 12y\n\nNow, we can factor the left-hand side of the equation:\n\n(x + y)(xy) = 12x + 12y\n\nNow, we can divide both sides of the equation by (x + y):\n\nxy = 12\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of xy = 12 back into the equation xy = 12:\n\n12 = 12\n\nThis is a true statement, so we can conclude that the lengths of the legs of the larger triangle are x = 6 and y = 6.\n\nFinally, the sum of the lengths of the legs of the larger triangle is x + y = 6 + 6 = 12 inches.",

        "Let's start by noting that $ABCD$ is a square, so all its sides are equal, and $AB = 12$. We are given that $AP > CP$, which means that $\\angle BAP > \\angle CAP$, and therefore, $\\angle O_{1}BP > \\angle O_{1}CP$. Since $O_{1}$ is the circumcenter of $\\triangle ABP$, it is equidistant from the vertices $A$, $B$, and $P$.
