        "To find the value of $x$ that minimizes the quadratic function $f(x) = x^2 - 10x + 24$, we need to find the vertex of the parabola represented by the function. We can do this by finding the value of $x$ that makes the coefficient of $x^2$ positive and the coefficient of $x$ negative, since the vertex of a parabola of the form $ax^2+bx+c$ is given by the formula:\n\n$$x = \\frac{-b}{2a}$$\n\nIn this case, we have $a = 1$ and $b = -10$. So,\n\n$$x = \\frac{-(-10)}{2(1)} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5$$\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of $x^2- 10x + 24$ is obtained when $x = 5$. To find the minimum value itself, we can substitute $x = 5$ back into the function:\n\n$$f(5) = (5)^2 - 10(5) + 24 = 25 - 50 + 24 = -11$$\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function is $-11$, and it occurs when $x = 5$.\n\nFinal Answer: 5.0",
        "To find the minimum value of the quadratic function $y=3x^2+6x+9$, we need to find the vertex of its graph. The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula:\n\nx = -b / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3 and b = 6, so:\n\nx = -6 / (2 * 3)\nx = -6 / 6\nx = -1\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can find the corresponding y-value by substituting x = -1 into the equation:\n\ny = 3(-1)^2 + 6(-1) + 9\ny = 3 * 1 + 6 * (-1) + 9\ny = 3 - 6 + 9\ny = 6\n\nSo the minimum value of $y$ is 6.\n\nFinal Answer: 6.0",
        "To find the value of $(2\\star 10) \\star 5$, we first need to calculate $2\\star 10$ and $10\\star 2$ using the given operation $\\star$:\n\n$2\\star 10 = \\frac{(2+10)}{3} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4$\n\n$10\\star 2 = \\frac{(10+2)}{3} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4$\n\nNow, we can calculate $(2\\star 10) \\star 5$:\n\n$(2\\star 10) \\star 5 = 4 \\star 5 = \\frac{(4+5)}{3} = \\frac{9}{3} = 3$\n\nSo, $(2\\star 10) \\star 5 = 3$.\n\nFinal Answer: 3.0",
        "To find the value of $x^2 - y^2$, we first need to find the values of $x$ and $y$. We have two equations:\n\n1. $x + y = 16$\n2. $x-y = 2$\n\nWe can solve this system of linear equations using the following method:\n\n1. Add the two equations: $2x = 18$\n2. Solve for $x$: $x = 9$\n3. Substitute $x = 9$ into the first equation: $9 + y = 16$\n4. Solve for $y$: $y = 7$\n\nNow that we have the values of $x$ and $y$, we can find the value of $x^2 - y^2$:\n\n$x^2 - y^2 = (9)^2 - (7)^2 = 81 - 49 = 32$\n\nSo, the value of $x^2 - y^2$ is 32.\n\nFinal Answer: 32.0",
        "To find the solutions $a$ and $b$, we need to solve the quadratic equation $x^2-4x+7=19$. First, we need to get this equation in standard form, which is $ax^2+bx+c=0$.\n\nSubtracting 19 from both sides, we have:\n\n$$x^2-4x-12=0$$\n\nNext, we complete the square by adding and subtracting $(2x)^2$:\n\n$$x^2-4x+4x^2-16x^2+16-12=0$$\n\n$$(x-2)^2-(12-16) = 16$$\n\n$$(x-2)^2-4 = 16$$\n\nNow, we solve for $x$ by taking the square root of both sides and then adding 2:\n\n$$x-2 = \\pm \\sqrt{16}$$\n\n$$x-2 = \\pm 4$$\n\nSo the solutions are $a = x_1 = 2 + 4 = 6$ and $b = x_2 = 2 - 4 = -2$.\n\nNow, we can find the value of $2a+b$:\n\n$$2a+b = 2(6) + (-2) = 12 - 2 = 10$$\n\nFinal Answer: 10.0",
        "To find $f(f(f(17)))$, we need to apply the function $f$ three times in a row, starting with the number 17.\n\nFirst, let's find $f(17)$:\n\n\\[f(17) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{cl}\n(17)^2-4 & \\text{ if } 17 < 7, \\\\\n17-13 & \\text{ if } 17 \\geq 7.\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\\]\n\nSince 17 is greater than 7, we have:\n\n\\[f(17) = 17-13 = 4.\\]\n\nNext, let's find $f(4)$:\n\n\\[f(4) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{cl}\n(4)^2-4 & \\text{ if } 4 < 7, \\\\\n4-13 & \\text{ if } 4 \\geq 7.\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\\]\n\nSince 4 is less than 7, we have:\n\n\\[f(4) = (4)^2-4 = 12.\\]\n\nFinally, let's find $f(12)$:\n\n\\[f(12) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{cl}\n(12)^2-4 & \\text{ if } 12 < 7, \\\\\n12-13 & \\text{ if } 12 \\geq 7.\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\\]\n\nSince 12 is greater than 7, we have:\n\n\\[f(12) = 12-13 = -1.\\]\n\nSo, $f(f(f(17))) = -1$.\n\nFinal Answer: -1.0"
