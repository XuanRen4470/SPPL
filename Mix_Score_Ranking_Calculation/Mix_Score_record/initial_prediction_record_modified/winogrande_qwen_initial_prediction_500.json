        "Given the context of the sentence, the correct option to fill in the blank is:\n\nOption 1: GPS\n\nThe sentence implies that there was a moment when the navigation became confusing or the direction was unclear, leading to getting lost. Since GPS is an electronic device that provides real-time navigation, it is more likely that it could malfunction or display information incorrectly, causing confusion. A map, on the other hand, is a static tool and typically does not get \"turned upside down\" in the same way. Therefore, the logical choice is \"GPS.\"",
        "Given the context of the sentence, the correct option to fill in the blank is:\n\nOption 1: GPS\n\nThe sentence suggests that the GPS and map were helpful for navigation, but the navigation got lost when something was turned off. It makes more sense that the GPS was turned off, as GPS is an electronic device that can be powered on or off, whereas a map is typically a physical object that is always available unless it is lost or destroyed. Therefore, the logical conclusion is that the GPS got turned off, causing the navigation to fail.",
        "The correct option is Option 1: Emily.\n\nThe sentence structure suggests that Emily is the one who looked up and saw Patricia. Therefore, it makes more sense that Emily is the one on the ramp, as Patricia is racing by overhead.

Therefore, to overcome behavioral bias, focusing on changing conscious actions is more effective since unconscious actions cannot be directly controlled through deliberate changes.",

It is logical that Joseph would use this beautiful house as an example in his portfolio, as he is the designer.",

        "Given the context of the question, the most likely option is:\n\nOption 1: Katrina\n\nThis is because Katrina is being taught how to speak Korean, which suggests that Katrina might not be a native Korean speaker.

        "Given the context of the question, the correct option is:\n\nOption 2: arm\n\nThe medical exam for the broken arm was longer than the exam on the heart because the broken arm was a serious problem that required more detailed examination and treatment.",
        "The correct option is:\n\nOption 1: heart\n\nThe statement suggests that the exam for the heart was more serious, which is why it was longer than the exam for the broken arm.",
        "The correct option is Option 1: Kenneth.\n\nThe sentence suggests that Kenneth is the one who forgot who their crush was, which is why Kenneth sighed at Jeffrey when opening up about their crush.",

In contrast, Felicia did not enjoy the summer, so it is less likely that she spent much time at the beach.",
        "Given the context of the question, the correct option is:\n\nOption 1: glue\n\nThe sentence suggests that the wallpaper is adhered to the wall using glue, and the issue John is facing is that the wallpaper tears apart when he tries to remove it. This implies that the glue is holding the wallpaper too strongly, making it difficult to remove without causing damage. Therefore, the glue is the weak point in this scenario.",
        "Given the context of the question, the correct option is:\n\nOption 1: glue\n\nThe statement suggests that the wallpaper is adhered to the wall with glue, and the glue is strong enough to make it difficult for John to remove the wallpaper without causing it to tear apart.",
        "The correct option is Option 2: blanket.\n\nThe sentence suggests that the counselor chose to give the child a teddy bear instead of a blanket because the blanket was boring. Therefore, the blank should be filled with \"blanket.\"",

The pot is hard.\" \n\nHowever, it's worth noting that pots are typically not described as \"hard\" in the sense that would make sense in this context. Pots are usually made of materials like clay, ceramic, or metal, which can be fragile and breakable. If the intention was to convey that the pot is strong or durable despite being broken, a different word might be more appropriate.",

This implies that Kyle's belief is about Samuel's jam being superior. Therefore, the correct option would be:\n\nOption 2: Kyle\n\nKyle still believed that Samuel's jam should have won, despite Samuel having won the contest.",
        "Based on the context provided, the blank should be filled with the name of the person whose entry used a high-calorie sweetener. Since Kyle believed that Samuel should have won, it implies that Samuel's entry was likely sweetened with a high-calorie sweetener, which Kyle thought was the deciding factor.

        "Given the context of the sentence, the correct option would be:\n\nOption 1: sprays\n\nThe sentence suggests that the sprays were not effective in getting rid of the bedbugs because the bedbugs were resistant or powerful enough to withstand the sprays.",

        "The correct option based on the given sentence is:\n\nOption 1: Monica\n\nThe sentence states that \"Monica enjoyed watching Western films while Natalie enjoyed romantic ones more because _ grew up watching soap operas.\" Since the blank is meant to be filled with the name of the person who grew up watching soap operas, and Monica is mentioned as enjoying Western films, it implies that Natalie is the one who grew up watching soap operas. Therefore, the blank should be filled with Natalie's name, but since the sentence structure suggests the person who enjoys romantic films (Natalie) is the one who grew up watching soap operas, Monica is the one who does not fit this description.",

        "The correct option is Option 2: Emily. \n\nThe sentence states that Jennifer was at risk of encountering a shark during their swim, implying that she was in the ocean. In contrast, Emily was not at risk of encountering a shark because she was not swimming in the ocean.",
        "The correct option is:\n\nOption 2: Emily\n\nThis is because the sentence states that Emily was not at risk of encountering a shark during their swim, which implies that Emily swam in a location where there were no sharks, such as a lake.

        "The correct option is Option 2: Documents.\n\nThe sentence should read: \"The documents contained in the files could not fit properly. The documents were too small.\"\n\nThis makes more sense because it is the documents that need to fit into the files, and if they are too small, they would not fit properly.",

        "To determine the correct option, we need to understand the context of raising the pH in a pool.

        "The correct option is:\n\nOption 1: Katrina\n\nThe sentence suggests that Katrina's teeth are more yellow than Laura's because she drinks mostly coffee all the time. Therefore, Katrina is the one who drinks mostly coffee.",
        "The correct option is Option 1: iron.\n\nThe sentence should read: \"It was necessary to hit the iron with the sledgehammer after the iron got heated.\"\n\nThis is because the iron needs to be heated first to make it more malleable or to prepare it for the action of being hit with the sledgehammer. The sledgehammer is used to shape or work the iron, not to be heated.",
        "The correct option is:\n\nOption 1: iron\n\nThe sentence should read: \"It was necessary to hit the iron with the sledgehammer before the iron got heated.\"\n\nThis implies that heating the iron is the intended goal, and using the sledgehammer to strike the iron is a method to achieve that goal, likely through the process of forge welding or similar metallurgical techniques where impact can help heat the metal.",
        "Given the context of the sentence, the correct option is:\n\nOption 1: Kevin\n\nThe sentence suggests that Kevin did not consider the costs when buying the house, implying that Kevin might have ended up with a house that has high maintenance or other financial issues (referred to as a \"money pit\"). Therefore, Kevin is the one who was left with the money pit, meaning Kevin is the one who is rid of (or burdened by) the money pit.",
        "The correct option is:\n\nOption 1: Kevin\n\nSince Kevin didn't consider the costs when buying the house from Derrick, it logically follows that Kevin would be the one stuck with the \"money pit,\" which refers to a property that requires significant and ongoing expenses to maintain or improve.",
        "Based on the sentence structure provided, the correct option appears to be:\n\nOption 2: Kyle\n\nThe sentence implies that Kyle is the subject of the dance in the video, and Robert helped create the viral sensation.",

        "The correct option is Option 2: Angela.\n\nThe sentence suggests that Betty was able to hold the pigeon longer than Angela because Angela was not scared of birds. This implies that Angela was the one who was not scared, which would allow her to handle the bird for a longer period. Conversely, Betty likely had some fear or apprehension about handling the bird, which is why she could hold it for a shorter time.",
        "The correct option is:\n\nOption 1: Nick\n\nJock itch is a fungal infection that commonly affects the groin area, often due to the warm and moist environment caused by tight clothing.

Jason, who has never worn a jock strap, is less likely to have experienced jock itch.",
        "Given the information provided:\n\n- Nick gets jock itch a lot.\n- Jason has never even worn a jock strap.\n\nJock itch is a common fungal infection that affects the groin area, often occurring in athletes due to the warm, moist environment created by tight clothing and sweat. Since Nick gets jock itch frequently, it suggests he is likely an athlete who wears tight clothing, such as jockstraps, which can contribute to the development of jock itch. On the other hand, Jason has never worn a jock strap, which might suggest he is not an athlete or does not engage in activities that would typically require wearing one.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\nOption 1: Nick",

        "The correct option is:\n\nOption 1: butter\n\nIn baking, shortening is often used instead of butter to achieve a lighter texture in biscuits. This is because shortening contains no water, which means it doesn't contribute to the moisture content of the dough. As a result, biscuits made with shortening tend to be flakier and lighter than those made with butter, which has a higher moisture content.",
        "The correct option is:\n\nOption 1: butter\n\nIn baking, butter can make biscuits (or other baked goods) richer and more tender, but it can also make them more likely to be heavy or dense. Shortening, on the other hand, is often used to create a flakier texture because it has a higher melting point and creates more steam when baking, which can lead to a lighter texture. Since Michelle made her biscuits with shortening and no butter, she likely thought that the butter would make them too heavy.",

        "The correct option is:\n\nOption 1: body\n\nThe sentence suggests that while chess is beneficial for the brain due to the mental effort involved in thinking and strategizing, it is not good for the body. Therefore, the blank should be filled with \"body.\"",
        "The correct option is Option 2: Mary.\n\nThe sentence states that Mary wanted a firm toothbrush because she was concerned about tartar. Since tartar buildup is more of a concern for someone who might need a firmer brush to remove it effectively, Mary is the one with the concern about tartar.",
        "The correct option is Option 2: Mary. \n\nSince Mary is concerned about soreness, she would prefer a firm toothbrush, while Amy wants a soft toothbrush.",
        "The correct option is:\n\nOption 2: Kenneth\n\nThe sentence should read: \"Jeffrey built a house for Kenneth so Kenneth will have a nice new place to live.\"",
        "The sentence \"Jeffrey built a house with Kenneth's help so _ will have a nice new place to live\" suggests that both Jeffrey and Kenneth are beneficiaries of the house. However, given the context and the structure of the sentence, it implies that the blank should be filled with the name of the person who is the primary builder, as the sentence structure seems to focus on Jeffrey's actions.\n\nTherefore, the most logical completion would be:\n\nOption 1: Jeffrey\n\nThe sentence would read: \"Jeffrey built a house with Kenneth's help so Jeffrey will have a nice new place to live.\"\n\nThis implies that Jeffrey is the primary builder and will be the primary beneficiary, although Kenneth's help is acknowledged.",
        "Option 1: Megan\n\nSince Megan had a baby, she would still need to change diapers. Katrina, having a college-aged child, would not need to change diapers as that task is typically associated with infants and young toddlers.",
        "Option 1: Megan\n\nSince Megan had a baby, she would still need to change diapers. On the other hand, Katrina has a college-aged child, who is old enough to no longer require diaper changes.",

        "The correct option is not explicitly clear from the given sentence alone. The sentence states two separate pieces of information:\n\n1. Kevin found running the marathon easier than Dennis.\n2. Someone (the blank) had repeatedly meant to stop smoking.\n\nWithout additional context, we cannot definitively determine whether Kevin or Dennis is the one who repeatedly meant to stop smoking. Therefore, based solely on the information provided, neither option can be conclusively determined as correct.\n\nIf you have more context or information that could help clarify this, please provide it so that a more accurate answer can be given.",
        "The sentence provided does not give enough information to definitively determine who had decided to stop smoking. The statement \"Kevin found running the marathon easier than Dennis\" only provides information about their relative abilities or experiences with running a marathon. It does not provide any information about smoking habits or decisions to stop smoking.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot correctly choose between Option 1 (Kevin) or Option 2 (Dennis) as the one who had decided to stop smoking.

        "The correct option is:\n\nOption 1: Steven\n\nThe sentence states that the idea was given to Steven to mull over and not Ryan because Steven is more creative. Therefore, Steven is the more creative one in this context.",
        "The correct option is:\n\nOption 2: Ryan\n\nThe sentence suggests that the idea was given to Steven to mull over instead of Ryan because Ryan is less creative.",
        "The correct option is Option 2: Kenneth.\n\nThe sentence states that Michael bought mealworms as pet food but Kenneth did not. The reason given is that \"Kenneth had a pony as a pet.\" This implies that since Kenneth had a pony, he did not need to buy mealworms as food for a different pet, unlike Michael who presumably bought mealworms for another pet.",
        "The correct option is:\n\nOption 2: Kenneth\n\nThe sentence states that Kenneth did not buy mealworms because he had a lizard as a pet, implying that Michael bought the mealworms for his own lizard.",

        "Option 1: Mary\n\nSince Mary is sending the package to Sarah, it would make sense that Mary is the one who takes it to the post office.",
        "The correct option is Option 2: Joel.\n\nThe sentence states that Joel avoided the dyslexic students because he \"struggled with reading.\" Therefore, Joel is the one who has difficulty reading, not Craig.",

        "The correct option in this context is:\n\nOption 1: closet\n\nThe sentence would read: \"The woman wanted to hang the dress in the closet but the closet was too large.\"\n\nThis doesn't make logical sense because a closet being too large wouldn't be a problem for hanging a dress. It's more likely that the issue is with the dress being too large to fit properly in the closet, or perhaps the closet having insufficient hanging space. However, based on the given options and the structure of the sentence, \"closet\" is the logical choice to complete the sentence.",

        "The correct option is:\n\nOption 2: Logan\n\nThe sentence suggests that Logan was never in need of extra change, which implies he did not recycle aluminum cans because he didn't see a benefit in doing so. Samuel, on the other hand, knew about recycling aluminum cans, indicating he was likely motivated by the potential to earn extra change.",
        "The correct option is Option 2: Logan.\n\nThe sentence suggests that Logan is always in need of extra change, which implies that he would be more inclined to keep the money from recycling aluminum cans rather than recycle them.
