Then, we pick up the yellow block and stack it on top of the red block. Finally, we pick up the orange block again and stack it on top of the yellow block.\n\nSince we can only pick up or unstack one block at a time, we need to follow these steps in order to achieve the goal efficiently. We cannot directly stack the orange block on top of the red block because the red block is not clear (the yellow block is on top of it). Therefore, we need to first move the yellow block to the side (by stacking it on top of the red block) before we can stack the orange block on top of the red block.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack yellow red)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)\n(unstack yellow blue)\n(stack yellow red)\n",

The current order is blue, orange, red. To achieve the goal, we need to have red, orange, blue.\n\nThe plan starts by unstacking the orange block from on top of the red block and putting it down. This is necessary because we cannot stack a block on a block that is not clear, and the red block is currently not clear since the orange block is on top of it.\n\nNext, we unstack the red block from on top of the blue block and stack it on top of the blue block. This places the red block in the correct position, but the orange block is still not in the correct position.\n\nTo move the orange block, we need to pick it up, which requires an empty hand. Therefore, we pick up the yellow block and stack it on top of the orange block, freeing up the orange block for us to move.\n\nFinally, we can unstack the orange block from where it is and stack it on top of the red block, achieving the goal.
