The only way to do this is to pick up the red block and put it somewhere, then unstack the yellow block.\n\n1. **Pick up the red block.**\n2. **Put down the red block on the table.**\n3. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block.**\n4. **Put down the yellow block.**\n5. **Pick up the red block.**\n6. **Stack the red block on top of the orange block.**\n7. **Pick up the blue block.**\n8. **Stack the blue block on top of the red block.**\n9. **Pick up the yellow block.**\n10. **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.**\n\nHere is the revised plan:\n\n1. **Pick up the red block.**\n2. **Put down the red block on the table.**\n3. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block.**\n4. **Put down the yellow block.**\n5. **Pick up the red block.**\n6. **Stack the red block on top of the orange block.**\n7. **Pick up the blue block.**\n8. **Stack the blue block on top of the red block.**\n9. **Pick up the yellow block.**\n10. **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.**\n\nThis plan should achieve the goal state.",
        "Let's re-plan the sequence of actions based on the new state after the unexpected event. Here are the initial conditions and the goal:\n\n### Initial Conditions:\n- Red block is clear.\n- Yellow block is clear.\n- Hand is empty.\n- Blue block is on top of the orange block.\n- Yellow block is on top of the blue block.\n- Red block is on the table.\n- Orange block is on the table.\n\n### Goal:\n- Blue block is on top of the orange block.\n- Orange block is on top of the red block.\n- Yellow block is on top of the blue block.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block.\n2. Put down the yellow block.\n3. Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block.\n4. Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block.\n5. Pick up the orange block.\n6. Stack the orange block on top of the red block.\n7. Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block.\n8. Stack the blue block on top of the orange block.\n9. Pick up the yellow block.\n10. Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n\n### Unexpected Event:\n- After executing the action \"unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block,\" the following facts unexpectedly became true:\n  - Yellow block is clear.\n  - Hand is empty.\n  - Yellow block is on top of the red block.\n- The following facts became unexpectedly false:\n  - Red block is clear.\n  - Hand is currently holding the yellow block.\n\n### New State:\n- Yellow block is clear.\n- Hand is empty.\n- Yellow block is on top of the red block.\n- Blue block is on top of the orange block.\n- Red block is on the table.\n- Orange block is on the table.\n\n### Re-Plan:\nGiven the new state, we need to adjust the plan to account for the yellow block now being on top of the red block. Here is the revised plan:\n\n1. **Unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block.**\n2. **Put down the yellow block.**\n3. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block.**\n4. **Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block.**\n5. **Pick up the orange block.**\n6. **Stack the orange block on top of the red block.**\n7. **Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block.**\n8. **Stack the blue block on top of the orange block.**\n9. **Pick up the yellow block.**\n10. **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.**\n\n### Final Plan:\n1.
