        "Let's break this down step by step!\n\nJoy can read 8 pages in 20 minutes. To find out how many pages she can read in 1 minute, we can divide 8 pages by 20 minutes:\n\n8 pages \u00f7 20 minutes = 0.4 pages per minute\n\nNow, let's convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so:\n\n20 minutes \u00f7 60 = 0.33 hours\n\nNow, we can use the rate of 0.4 pages per minute to find out how many pages Joy can read in 0.33 hours:\n\n0.4 pages per minute \u00d7 0.33 hours = 0.132 pages per hour\n\nSince Joy reads 0.132 pages per hour, we can multiply this by the total number of pages she needs to read (120 pages) to find the total time it will take her:\n\n120 pages \u00f7 0.132 pages per hour = 909.09 minutes\n\nFinally, we can convert the total time from minutes to hours:\n\n909.09 minutes \u00f7 60 = 15.15 hours\n\nSo, it will take Joy approximately 15 hours and 9 minutes to read 120 pages.",

        "Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the company paved 4 miles on the first day. This means they used 3 truckloads * 4 miles = 12 truckloads of asphalt. Each truckload uses 5 times as many bags of gravel as it does barrels of pitch. So each truckload uses 2 bags of gravel and 2/5 bags of pitch (5 times as many bags of gravel as it does barrels of pitch). Each truckload uses 2 + 2/5 = 2 2/5 bags of gravel and pitch. So 12 truckloads of asphalt uses 12 * (2 2/5) = 28 bags of gravel and pitch.\n\nThe second day, they paved one mile less than double the first day. So they paved 2 * 4 - 1 = 7 miles. This means they used 3 truckloads * 7 miles = 21 truckloads of asphalt. Each truckload uses 2 bags of gravel and 2/5 bags of pitch. So 21 truckloads of asphalt uses 21 * (2 2/5) = 42 bags of gravel and pitch.\n\nIn total, they used 28 + 42 = 70 bags of gravel and pitch. Each bag of gravel and pitch contains 2/5 bags of pitch. So the total amount of pitch is 70 * (2/5) = 28 bags of pitch.\n\nThe road is 16 miles long, and they paved 4 + 7 = 11 miles so far. So they have 16 - 11 = 5 miles left to pave. They need 3 truckloads of asphalt to pave each mile of road. So they need 3 truckloads * 5 miles = 15 truckloads of asphalt. Each truckload uses 2/5 bags of pitch.

To find the total number of people at the gathering, we need to add the number of people who took neither drink (i.e., 0 drinks):\n\n31 (at least one drink) + x (0 drinks) = total number of people\n\nSince each person could have taken one or more drinks, the number of people who took 0 drinks is equal to the number of people who didn't attend the gathering. Let's call this number y.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n31 + y = total number of people\n\nTo find the total number of people, we need to add the number of people who took at least one drink (31) to the number of people who didn't attend (y).\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\n31 + y = total number of people\n\nSince we know that 17 people took both drinks, the number of people who took at least one drink (31) is equal to the number of people who took wine (26) or soda (22) minus the number of people who took both drinks (17):\n\n31 = 26 + 22 - 17\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n31 = 31\n\nThis means that the number of people who took at least one drink (31) is equal to the total number of people at the gathering!\n\nTherefore, there were 31 people at the gathering.",

        "Let's break this down step by step!\n\nSamuel swept the porch and cleared 9/10 of the dust particles, which means he left 1/10 of the dust particles behind. This is because 9/10 + 1/10 = 10/10, which is the whole amount of dust particles.\n\nAfter he walked across the porch, his shoes left 223 dust particles behind. This means that the total number of dust particles on the porch after he walked across it is 331 (the original amount) + 223 (the new amount) = 554.\n\nSince Samuel cleared 9/10 of the dust particles, the amount he cleared is 9/10 of the original amount. Let's call the original amount \"x\". Then, the amount Samuel cleared is 9x/10.\n\nThe amount Samuel cleared is also equal to the original amount minus the amount left behind, which is 1/10 of the original amount. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n9x/10 = x - x/10\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n9x/10 = 9x/10\n\nThis means that the amount Samuel cleared is equal to the amount left behind, which is 223.\n\nNow, we can use this information to find the original amount. Since Samuel cleared 9/10 of the dust particles, the amount he cleared is 9/10 of the original amount. Let's call the original amount \"x\". Then, the amount Samuel cleared is 9x/10.\n\nWe know that the amount Samuel cleared is 223, so we can set up the equation:\n\n9x/10 = 223\n\nMultiplying both sides by 10 to eliminate the fraction, we get:\n\n9x = 2230\n\nDividing both sides by 9, we get:\n\nx = 248\n\nSo, the original amount of dust particles on the porch was 248.",

Then, he loses 0.6x marbles into the street.\n\nThe remaining marbles are 1 - 0.6 = 0.4x marbles.\n\nHe then loses half of these remaining marbles down a sewer. So, he loses 0.5 x 0.4x = 0.2x marbles down the sewer.\n\nNow, he has 20 marbles left. This means that the number of marbles he lost down the sewer (0.2x) plus the number of marbles he has left (20) is equal to the number of marbles he had initially (x).\n\n0.2x + 20 = x\n\nSubtract 20 from both sides:\n\n0.2x = x - 20\n\nSubtract x from both sides:\n\n-0.8x = -20\n\nDivide both sides by -0.8:\n\nx = 20 / 0.8\n\nx = 25\n\nSo, Archie started with 25 marbles.",

To find the amount deducted as taxes, we can calculate 10% of $40:\n\n10% of $40 = 0.10 x $40 = $4\n\nSo, Adam's daily taxes are $4.\n\nSince Adam works for 30 days, his total earnings would be:\n\n$40 (daily earnings) x 30 (days) = $1200\n\nHowever, we need to subtract the taxes from his total earnings. To do this, we can multiply the daily taxes by the number of days:\n\n$4 (daily taxes) x 30 (days) = $120\n\nNow, let's subtract the taxes from Adam's total earnings:\n\n$1200 (total earnings) - $120 (total taxes) = $1080\n\nSo, after 30 days of work, Adam will have earned $1080 after taxes.",

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(l + w), where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.\n2. We know the perimeter is 30 feet, so we can set up the equation: 2(l + w) = 30\n3. Since the length is twice the width, we can write l = 2w\n4. Substitute this expression for l into the equation: 2(2w + w) = 30\n5. Simplify the equation: 2(3w) = 30\n6. Divide both sides by 2: 3w = 15\n7. Divide both sides by 3: w = 5\n\nSo, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet!",

        "Let's break it down game by game:\n\n* Game 1: 30 points, so James gets paid $10,000 for this game.\n* Game 2: 28 points, so James gets paid $8,000 for this game.\n* Game 3: 32 points, so James gets paid $10,000 for this game.\n* Game 4: 34 points, so James gets paid $10,000 for this game.\n* Game 5: 26 points, so James gets paid $8,000 for this game.\n\nTo find the total amount James gets paid, we add up the amounts for each game:\n\n$10,000 + $8,000 + $10,000 + $10,000 + $8,000 = $46,000\n\nSo James gets paid $46,000 for the week.",
        "There are 6 people with 5 bags each. That is 6 * 5 = 30 bags. Each bag is 50 pounds. So the total weight of the bags is 30 * 50 = 1500 pounds. The airplane can hold 6000 pounds, but it is already holding 1500 pounds. So it can hold 6000 - 1500 = 4500 pounds more. Since each bag is 50 pounds, it can hold 4500 / 50 = 90 more bags. The answer is 90.",
        "Let's break it down step by step!\n\nSalvadore earned $1956.\n\nSanto earned half of what Salvadore earned, so Santo earned:\n\n$1956 \u00f7 2 = $978\n\nNow, let's add the amount earned by both men:\n\nSalvadore's earnings: $1956\nSanto's earnings: $978\nTotal earnings: $1956 + $978 = $2934\n\nSo, the two men earned a total of $2934 together!"
