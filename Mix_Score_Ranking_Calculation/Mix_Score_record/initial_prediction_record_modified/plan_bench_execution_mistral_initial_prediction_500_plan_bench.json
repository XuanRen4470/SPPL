        "The yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on the table next to the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, and the orange block is on the table.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. In the initial state, the red block is on top of the yellow block. To unstack the red block, the hand must be empty and the red block must be clear (no blocks on top of it).\n2. Since the hand is empty in the initial state, the first action (unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block) can be executed.\n3. After unstacking the red block, it is now in the hand.\n4. The second action (put down the red block) can be executed since the hand is holding the red block and there is an empty spot on the table where the red block can be put down (the red block was just unstacked from there).\n5. After putting down the red block, the hand becomes empty again.\n6. Therefore, the resulting state is that the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on the table next to the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, and the orange block is on the table.",

In the first action, we unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block, which means we have picked up the yellow block and are now holding it in our hand. Since the hand was empty before, this action satisfies the condition that we can only pick up a block if our hand is empty and the block is clear.\n\nIn the second action, we put down the yellow block. Since we are holding the yellow block and the table is clear, we can put down the yellow block on the table.
