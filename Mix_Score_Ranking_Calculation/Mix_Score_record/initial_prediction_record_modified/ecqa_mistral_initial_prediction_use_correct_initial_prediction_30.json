        "The correct answer is (2) kitchen or (5) cupboard. Silverware is typically kept in a kitchen drawer or in a cupboard in the kitchen. It is less common to find silverware in a bedroom, table, or restaurant drawer.\n\nFinal Answer: 2",
        "The correct option is (3): paid for, but in this context, it's important to note that you didn't pay for the gift yourself, rather the person who gave it to you did. So, you didn't incur any cost for the gift.\n\nFinal Answer: 3",

        "The correct answer is (4): ground. Animals dig holes in the ground for various reasons such as denning, hiding, or foraging. Options (1), (2), (3), and (5) are not typical places where animals make holes. A trap is a device used to catch animals, not a place where they make holes. A golf course is a large open area with grass and sand, not a place where animals make holes (although they may use them for playing). A wall is a structure made of brick, concrete, or other materials, not a place where animals make holes. Swiss cheese is a food product, not a place where animals make holes.\n\nFinal Answer: 4",
        "The correct answer is (1) restaurant. Bobby was likely in a restaurant when he noticed the plastic silverware, as that is an experience where one would typically expect to find real silverware. The other options do not fit the context of the situation.\n\nFinal Answer: 1",

An office is a workspace, a library is a collection of books, a building is a large structure, and a coffee shop is a place to buy coffee and often socialize.\n\nFinal Answer: 3",
        "The correct answer would be (4) yard. Trees are commonly found near houses in yards.

An orchard is a large area of land planted with fruit trees, conservation land is protected natural area, countryside refers to rural areas, and surface of the earth could refer to any area of land, not just one with trees near houses.\n\nFinal Answer: 4"
