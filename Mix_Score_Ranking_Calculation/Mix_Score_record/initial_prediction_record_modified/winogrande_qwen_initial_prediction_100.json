        "Given the information provided, Logan is more likely to live in a warmer climate. Since Logan almost always wears leg warmers to bed, it suggests that they might need the extra warmth or heat, which is more common in cooler or colder climates.

        "Given the context of the sentence, the correct option to fill in the blank is:\n\nOption 1: GPS\n\nThe sentence implies that there was a moment when the navigation became confusing or the direction was unclear, leading to getting lost. Since GPS is an electronic device that provides real-time navigation, it is more likely that it could malfunction or display information incorrectly, causing confusion. A map, on the other hand, is a static tool and typically does not get \"turned upside down\" in the same way. Therefore, the logical choice is \"GPS.\"",
        "Given the context of the sentence, the correct option to fill in the blank is:\n\nOption 1: GPS\n\nThe sentence suggests that the GPS and map were helpful for navigation, but the navigation got lost when something was turned off. It makes more sense that the GPS was turned off, as GPS is an electronic device that can be powered on or off, whereas a map is typically a physical object that is always available unless it is lost or destroyed. Therefore, the logical conclusion is that the GPS got turned off, causing the navigation to fail.",
        "The correct option is Option 1: Emily.\n\nThe sentence structure suggests that Emily is the one who looked up and saw Patricia. Therefore, it makes more sense that Emily is the one on the ramp, as Patricia is racing by overhead.

        "The correct option is Option 2: conscious.\n\nThe question states that we need to focus more on changing conscious actions because conscious actions are voluntary. Unconscious actions, on the other hand, are not under our direct control.",
        "The correct option is:\n\nOption 1: unconscious\n\nUnconscious actions are involuntary, meaning they happen without conscious thought or awareness. Therefore, to overcome behavioral bias, focusing on changing conscious actions is more effective since unconscious actions cannot be directly controlled through deliberate changes.",
        "The correct option is:\n\nOption 1: Megan\n\nThis is because the sentence states that Megan has a lot less money than Jessica, implying that Jessica recently bought the winning lottery ticket and thus has a significant amount of money, making Megan relatively poorer in comparison.",

        "Based on the question, the correct option is:\n\nOption 1: Donald\n\nThe sentence structure suggests that Donald was richer because the oil was found on his property, not Leslie's.",
        "Based on the question provided, the correct option is:\n\nOption 2: Leslie\n\nThe sentence suggests that Donald was poorer than Leslie because of an event related to oil discovery on Leslie's property.

It is logical that Joseph would use this beautiful house as an example in his portfolio, as he is the designer.",
        "The correct option is Option 2: pan.\n\nThe sentence should read: \"John poured the entire bowl of fish into the hot pan on the stove until the pan was full.\" \n\nThis makes logical sense because John is pouring the fish from the bowl into the pan, and the pan is the container that would become full as a result of the action.",

Therefore, it is unlikely that Benjamin would be happy about Aaron hanging his hunting rifle over the hearth, as he was the one who caused the fatal shot.\n\nAaron, on the other hand, might feel a mix of emotions but could be more likely to be satisfied with the rifle being properly hung, especially if the trip ended unfavorably.\n\nSo, the most logical answer would be:\n\nOption 1: Aaron",
