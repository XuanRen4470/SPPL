        "Given the information provided, Logan is more likely to live in a colder climate. Since Logan almost always wears leg warmers to bed, it suggests that Logan may be more concerned about keeping warm, which is more common in colder climates. Kyle, on the other hand, does not wear leg warmers to bed, indicating less concern about staying warm at night, which is less likely in a colder climate.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\nOption 2: Logan",
        "Given the information provided, Logan is more likely to live in a warmer climate. Since Logan almost always wears leg warmers to bed, it suggests that they might need the extra warmth or heat, which is more common in cooler or colder climates. On the other hand, Kyle does not wear leg warmers to bed, indicating they might be more comfortable in a warmer environment. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\nOption 2: Logan",
        "Given the context of the sentence, the correct option to fill in the blank is:\n\nOption 1: GPS\n\nThe sentence implies that there was a moment when the navigation became confusing or the direction was unclear, leading to getting lost. Since GPS is an electronic device that provides real-time navigation, it is more likely that it could malfunction or display information incorrectly, causing confusion. A map, on the other hand, is a static tool and typically does not get \"turned upside down\" in the same way. Therefore, the logical choice is \"GPS.\"",
        "Given the context of the sentence, the correct option to fill in the blank is:\n\nOption 1: GPS\n\nThe sentence suggests that the GPS and map were helpful for navigation, but the navigation got lost when something was turned off. It makes more sense that the GPS was turned off, as GPS is an electronic device that can be powered on or off, whereas a map is typically a physical object that is always available unless it is lost or destroyed. Therefore, the logical conclusion is that the GPS got turned off, causing the navigation to fail.",
        "The correct option is Option 1: Emily.\n\nThe sentence structure suggests that Emily is the one who looked up and saw Patricia. Therefore, it makes more sense that Emily is the one on the ramp, as Patricia is racing by overhead. The sentence should read:\n\n\"Emily looked up and saw Patricia racing by overhead, as Emily was on the ramp.\"",
        "The correct option is Option 1: Emily.\n\nThe sentence structure suggests that Emily is the one looking up and seeing Patricia. Therefore, the blank should refer to Emily, making the full sentence read: \"Emily looked up and saw Patricia racing by overhead, as Emily was under the ramp.\"",
        "The correct option is Option 2: trolley.\n\nThe sentence indicates that the gold bars were moved from the trolley to the safe. Therefore, the trolley would be the one that becomes empty after the transfer is complete.",
        "The correct option is Option 1: safe. \n\nThe sentence describes the process of moving gold bars from a trolley to a safe. It makes sense that they would continue stacking the gold bars in the safe until the safe is full.",

        "The correct option is Option 2: table.\n\nThe sentence \"Cleaning the _ is quick\" refers to the plastic table, which she bought as a replacement for her wood chair because she found dusting the chair annoying.

        "The correct option is:\n\nOption 1: chair\n\nThe sentence \"Cleaning the chair is time consuming\" aligns with the context provided, where the person found dusting her wood chair annoying and therefore bought a plastic table as an alternative.",
        "The correct option is Option 2: conscious.\n\nThe question states that we need to focus more on changing conscious actions because conscious actions are voluntary. Unconscious actions, on the other hand, are not under our direct control.",
        "The correct option is:\n\nOption 1: unconscious\n\nUnconscious actions are involuntary, meaning they happen without conscious thought or awareness. Therefore, to overcome behavioral bias, focusing on changing conscious actions is more effective since unconscious actions cannot be directly controlled through deliberate changes.",
        "The correct option is:\n\nOption 1: Megan\n\nThis is because the sentence states that Megan has a lot less money than Jessica, implying that Jessica recently bought the winning lottery ticket and thus has a significant amount of money, making Megan relatively poorer in comparison.",

        "Given the sentence \"Dennis gave his hammer to Robert so he could hammer the nails,\" it implies that Dennis gave away his hammer to Robert. Therefore, after the transaction, Dennis no longer has his hammer.\n\nSo, the correct option is:\n\nOption 1: Dennis",
        "Given the context of the sentence, the correct option is:\n\nOption 2: funeral\n\nThe sentence suggests that the party was more interesting and uplifting than the funeral because the funeral was rigid. This implies that the funeral lacked flexibility or spontaneity, which made it less interesting and uplifting compared to the party.",

        "Given the question, the correct option is:\n\nOption 2: forests\n\nThe geese prefer to nest in the fields rather than the forests because in the forests, predators are more hidden. This makes the fields a safer choice for nesting since predators are less likely to be concealed in open areas.",
        "The correct option is Option 2: forests.\n\nThe geese prefer to nest in the fields rather than the forests because in the forests, predators are very visible to the geese. This implies that the geese can more easily spot and avoid predators in the open fields compared to the more concealed environments of the forests."
