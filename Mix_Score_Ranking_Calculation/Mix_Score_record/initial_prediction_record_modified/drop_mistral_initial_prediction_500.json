        "To find the percentage of the population who weren't of English ancestry, we can subtract the percentage of the population who were of English ancestry from 100%. The passage states that 9.2% of the population were of English ancestry. Therefore, the percentage of the population who weren't of English ancestry is:\n\n100% - 9.2% = 90.8%\n\nHowever, the passage also states that 1.52% of the population were of another specific race, and 1.47% were of two or more races. We don't know if any of these individuals were also of English ancestry or not, so we cannot include them in our calculation. Therefore, the percentage of the population who weren't of English or any of the specific races listed in the passage is:\n\n100% - 86.77% (Race) - 9.27% (Race) - 0.23% (Race) - 1.52% (Race) - 0.06% (Race) - 0.69% (Race) - 1.47% (Two or more races) = 8.48%\n\nSo, 8.48% of the population weren't of English or any of the specific races listed in the passage.",
        "To find the percentage of people in the census who weren't of Polish ancestry, we can subtract the percentage of people who were Polish from 100%. The passage states that 6.0% of the population were of Polish ancestry. Therefore, the percentage of people who weren't of Polish ancestry would be:\n\n100% - 6.0% = 94.0%\n\nHowever, this answer is not correct because the percentage should be expressed as a decimal rather than a percentage. To find the actual percentage of people who weren't of Polish ancestry, we can subtract the percentage of Polish ancestry from 100% and then convert the decimal to a percentage:\n\n94.0 / 100 = 0.94\n0.94 x 100 = 94.0%\n\nTherefore, 94.0% of the population in the census weren't of Polish ancestry. However, it's important to note that the passage also states that 1.47% of the population were from two or more races, so this number should be subtracted from the total population when calculating the percentage of people who weren't of Polish ancestry in order to get an accurate answer. To do this, we would first find the percentage of people who were Polish and those who were of multiple races, and then subtract those percentages from 100% to find the percentage of people who weren't of Polish ancestry. The calculation would look like this:\n\nTotal population: 218,590\nPopulation of Polish ancestry: 6.0% x 218,590 = 13,115.4\nPopulation of multiple races: 1.47% x 218,590 = 3,143.8\n\nTotal population of Polish and multiple races: 13,115.4 + 3,143.8 = 16,259.2\n\nTotal population not of Polish or multiple races: 218,590 - 16,259.2 = 202,330.8\n\nPercentage of population not of Polish or multiple races: (202,330.8 / 218,590) x 100% = 93.2%\n\nTherefore, approximately 93.2% of the population in the census weren't of Polish ancestry.",

        "The number of men registered for the military draft in the United States in 1917 was deemed inadequate, as it fell short of the initial target of 1 million enlistments. Specifically, only 73,000 volunteers enlisted within the first six weeks of the war, leading the administration to rely more heavily on conscription. The registration numbers were subsequently increased, with 10 million men registered by the end of 1917 and nearly 3 million inducted into the military services by the end of 1918.",
        "The draft was universal in the United States during World War I because the government wanted to raise military manpower quickly and efficiently, and voluntary enlistment was not meeting the target numbers. The draft included all men within certain age ranges, regardless of race or socio-economic status, in order to ensure a large and diverse pool of recruits. The universal nature of the draft was also intended to promote a sense of national unity and shared sacrifice during a time of war.",
        "The Selective Draft Law Cases held that the World War I draft was constitutional under the power of Congress to levy taxes and raise and regulate armed forces, and that it did not violate the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude. The Court reasoned that the draft was not a form of involuntary servitude because the servicemembers were not being compelled to labor without compensation, but rather were being required to serve in the military for a limited time, with the promise of pay and other benefits.",

        "The role of blacks and whites in the draft was similar in that they were both subject to the draft and served in the military, but there were some differences in their experiences. Blacks and whites were registered and inducted into the military services at the same rates, with a total of 24 million men registered and nearly 3 million inducted by the end of 1918. However, the number of black men drafted was significantly lower than the number of white men, with 367,710 black Americans drafted compared to 2,442,586 white Americans.\n\nOne key difference was that blacks and whites served in different units. While the draft was universal and included blacks on the same terms as whites, they were often segregated into separate units. This was a reflection of the segregation and discrimination that existed in American society at the time.\n\nThere were also differences in the experiences of blacks and whites in terms of resistance to the draft. While there were forms of resistance by both blacks and whites, such as dodging and desertion, the response to these actions varied depending on the race of the draft evader. In some cases, black draft dodgers were sheltered and defended by their communities as political heroes, while white draft dodgers were more likely to face arrest and punishment.\n\nOverall, while the draft affected both blacks and whites in similar ways, there were significant differences in their experiences and the response to their resistance to the draft.",

The passage does not provide much detail about the battle itself, but it mentions that it took place.\n\nOn the other hand, the release of 15,000 captives by the Nogais happened in 1618 as part of a peace treaty with Moscow. The passage explains that during the Time of Troubles, so many captives were taken that the price of a slave at Kaffa dropped to fifteen or twenty gold pieces. Later, in the peace treaty, the Nogais released 15,000 captives.\n\nTherefore, the Battle of Molodi and the release of 15,000 captives by the Nogais are two distinct events in Russian history. The Battle of Molodi was a military engagement, while the release of captives was a political event.",

However, it is mentioned that the price of a slave at Kaffa dropped significantly during this time, suggesting that the raids occurred around 1614. Therefore, the number of years that passed between these two events can be approximated as follows:\n\n1592 (burning of Moscow suburbs) + (approximately) 22 years (estimated duration of the Time of Troubles and the significant drop in slave prices at Kaffa) = 1614 (Nogai raids within sight of Moscow)\n\nThus, approximately 22 years passed from the burning of Moscow suburbs until the Nogai raids within sight of Moscow.",

The Dutch West India Company received a large investment in capital, drawing on the enthusiasm of the best financiers and capitalists of the Republic.\n\nHowever, the Dutch West India Company was not as successful as its eastern counterpart. The Dutch invasion began in 1624 with the conquest of Salvador, the then capital of the State of Brazil, but the Dutch conquest was short-lived. In 1625, a joint Spanish-Portuguese fleet recaptured Salvador.\n\nThe Dutch returned in 1630 and captured Olinda and Recife, renaming it Mauritsstadt and establishing the colony of New Holland. The Portuguese commander, Matias de Albuquerque, retreated his forces inland, and the Dutch were unable to harvest sugar due to Portuguese guerrilla attacks until 1635. The Dutch eventually evicted the Portuguese with the assistance of a local landlord named Domingos Fernandes Calabar, but Calabar was later captured and executed by the Portuguese for treason.\n\nThe Portuguese fought back two Dutch attacks on Bahia in 1638. Nonetheless, by 1641, the Dutch had captured S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, leaving them in control of northwestern Brazil between Maranh\u00e3o and Sergipe in the south.\n\nOverall, the Republic reacted to the quick, simple additions in the East by expanding its territorial holdings in the Americas through the establishment of the Dutch West India Company and military conquests. However, the Dutch were not as successful as they had hoped due to Portuguese resistance and guerrilla attacks.",
