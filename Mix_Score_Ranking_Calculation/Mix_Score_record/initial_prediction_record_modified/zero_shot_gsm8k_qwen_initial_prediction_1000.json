        "First, let's determine the price of a haircut on a weekday. According to the problem, Mario paid $18 for his haircut on Monday, which is a weekday.\n\nNext, we need to understand that haircuts are 50% more expensive on weekends. This means that the cost on the weekend is 150% of the weekday price (100% + 50% = 150%).\n\nTo find the weekend price, we can set up the equation where the weekday price is $18, and the weekend price is 150% of the weekday price. We can express 150% as 1.5 in decimal form.\n\nSo, the weekend price = $18 * 1.5\n\nNow, let's calculate the weekend price:\n\\[ \\text{Weekend price} = 18 \\times 1.5 = 27 \\]\n\nFinal Answer: 27",

        "To make 12 pizzas, we need to consider the constraints and steps involved:\n\n1. **Batch Production:** One batch of pizza dough makes 3 pizzas. Therefore, to make 12 pizzas, Camilla needs to make 4 batches of dough (since 12 / 3 = 4).\n\n2. **Dough Preparation Time:** Each batch of dough takes 30 minutes to prepare. So, for 4 batches, the total dough preparation time is 4 * 30 minutes = 120 minutes.\n\n3. **Baking Time:** The oven can fit 2 pizzas at a time and each pizza takes 30 minutes to bake. Since Camilla is making 12 pizzas, she needs to bake in batches of 2 pizzas each time.\n\n   - Number of baking batches needed: 12 / 2 = 6 batches.\n   - Total baking time: 6 * 30 minutes = 180 minutes.\n\n4. **Overlap Consideration:** The dough preparation and baking can overlap. For example, while the first batch of dough is being prepared, the first batch of pizzas can be baking. This means that the total time is determined by the longest continuous process, which in this case is the baking time since it is the limiting factor.\n\n5. **Total Time Calculation:** The total time is the sum of the dough preparation time and the baking time, considering the overlap. However, since the baking time is the longest and the dough preparation can happen in parallel, the total time is dominated by the baking time.\n\nThus, the total time required is 180 minutes, which is 3 hours.\n\nFinal Answer: 3",

        "Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Flow Rate and Escape Rate:**\n   - The tap fills the tub at a rate of 12 liters per minute.\n   - The tub loses 1 liter per minute due to the leak.\n\n2. **Net Gain in Water per Cycle:**\n   - In each 2-minute cycle (1 minute of filling and 1 minute of no flow), the net gain in water is:\n     \\[\n     12 \\text{ liters} - 1 \\text{ liter} = 11 \\text{ liters}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total Water Needed:**\n   - The tub has a capacity of 120 liters.\n\n4. **Calculating the Number of Full Cycles:**\n   - To find out how many full 2-minute cycles are needed to get close to 120 liters, we divide the total capacity by the net gain per cycle:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{120 \\text{ liters}}{11 \\text{ liters per cycle}} \\approx 10.909 \\text{ cycles}\n     \\]\n   - Since we can only have whole cycles, we need 11 full cycles to ensure the tub is filled.\n\n5. **Water Added in 11 Full Cycles:**\n   - In 11 cycles, the total water added is:\n     \\[\n     11 \\text{ cycles} \\times 11 \\text{ liters per cycle} = 121 \\text{ liters}\n     \\]\n   - This is more than the tub's capacity, so we need to adjust for the exact time.\n\n6. **Final Adjustments:**\n   - After 10 full cycles (20 minutes), the amount of water added is:\n     \\[\n     10 \\text{ cycles} \\times 11 \\text{ liters per cycle} = 110 \\text{ liters}\n     \\]\n   - We need an additional 10 liters to fill the tub. This can be achieved by running the tap for an additional minute (since the net gain per minute is 11 liters - 1 liter = 10 liters).\n\n7. **Total Time Calculation:**\n   - 10 full cycles take 20 minutes.\n   - An additional minute to fill the last 10 liters:\n     \\[\n     20 \\text{ minutes} + 1 \\text{ minute} = 21 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\nFinal Answer: 21",

He gave the remaining cards equally to his 2 sisters, and each sister got 3 cards, which totals \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) cards.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of cards given away and kept:\n- Cards Rick kept: 15\n- Cards given to friends: 96\n- Cards given to sisters: 6\n\nThe total number of cards accounted for is \\(15 + 96 + 6 = 117\\).\n\nSince Rick originally had 130 cards, the number of cards given to Miguel is \\(130 - 117 = 13\\).\n\nFinal Answer: 13",
        "First, let's determine the total number of pizza slices. Dean ordered 2 large pizzas, each cut into 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\]\n\nNext, let's break down how many slices each person ate:\n\n- Dean ate half of the Hawaiian pizza. Since the Hawaiian pizza has 12 slices, Dean ate:\n\\[ \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\text{ slices} \\]\n\n- Frank ate 3 slices of the Hawaiian pizza.\n\n- Sammy ate a third of the cheese pizza. Since the cheese pizza also has 12 slices, Sammy ate:\n\\[ \\frac{12}{3} = 4 \\text{ slices} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of slices eaten:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ (Dean)} + 3 \\text{ (Frank)} + 4 \\text{ (Sammy)} = 13 \\text{ slices} \\]\n\nFinally, to find the number of slices left over, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:\n\\[ 24 - 13 = 11 \\]\n\nFinal Answer: 11",
        "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Determine Josh's current age:**\n   - Josh turned 22 when they got married.\n   - They are celebrating 30 years of marriage.\n   - Therefore, Josh's current age is \\(22 + 30 = 52\\).\n\n2. **Determine Anna's current age:**\n   - Their combined current age is 5 times what Josh's age was when they got married.\n   - Josh's age when they got married was 22.\n   - Therefore, their combined current age is \\(5 \\times 22 = 110\\).\n   - Since Josh is currently 52, Anna's current age is \\(110 - 52 = 58\\).\n\n3. **Determine Anna's age when they got married:**\n   - Anna is currently 58.\n   - They have been married for 30 years.\n   - Therefore, Anna's age when they got married was \\(58 - 30 = 28\\).\n\nFinal Answer: 28",
        "Let's break down the expenses step by step:\n\n1. **Entry Fee**: James pays $20 to enter the club.\n2. **Drinks for Friends**: James buys 2 rounds for his 5 friends, which means he buys 10 drinks for his friends. Each drink costs $6, so the cost for the drinks for his friends is \\(10 \\times 6 = 60\\) dollars.\n3. **Drinks for Himself**: James buys 6 drinks for himself, which costs \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\) dollars.\n4. **Food**: James orders fried chicken which costs $14.\n5. **Total Cost Before Tip**: The total cost before the tip is the sum of the entry fee, the drinks for his friends, the drinks for himself, and the fried chicken. This is \\(20 + 60 + 36 + 14 = 130\\) dollars.\n6. **Tip**: James leaves a 30% tip on everything he orders. The tip is \\(0.30 \\times 130 = 39\\) dollars.\n7. **Total Cost**: The total cost for the night is the sum of the total cost before the tip and the tip, which is \\(130 + 39 = 169\\) dollars.\n\nFinal Answer: 169",
        "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the total number of fish caught:**\n   - Oomyapeck eats 22 fish eyes in a day.\n   - Since each fish has 2 eyes, the total number of fish caught is \\( \\frac{22}{2} = 11 \\) fish.\n\n2. **Distribute the fish:**\n   - The 11 fish are split equally among Ittymangnark, Kingnook, and Oomyapeck.\n   - Therefore, each person gets \\( \\frac{11}{3} \\) fish.\n\n3. **Simplify the fraction:**\n   - \\( \\frac{11}{3} = 3 \\frac{2}{3} \\) fish.\n\nSo, each of them will be given \\( 3 \\frac{2}{3} \\) fish to eat.\n\nFinal Answer: \\( 3 \\frac{2}{3} \\)",
        "To solve this problem, we need to consider both the rate at which water is being added to the pool and the rate at which water is leaking out.\n\n1. The garden hose fills the pool at a rate of 1.6 gallons per minute.\n2. The pool leaks water at a rate of 0.1 gallons per minute.\n\nThe net rate at which the pool is being filled is the difference between these two rates:\n\\[ 1.6 \\text{ gallons/minute} - 0.1 \\text{ gallons/minute} = 1.5 \\text{ gallons/minute} \\]\n\nThe pool holds 60 gallons when full. To find out how long it will take to fill the pool, we divide the total volume of the pool by the net rate of filling:\n\\[ \\frac{60 \\text{ gallons}}{1.5 \\text{ gallons/minute}} = 40 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nFinal Answer: 40",
        "First, let's calculate the total contribution from the students. Each of the 20 students contributed $5, so the total from the students is:\n\\[ 20 \\times 5 = 100 \\]\n\nAdding the initial $50 raised by the class, the total fund before paying for the trip is:\n\\[ 50 + 100 = 150 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the field trip. With 20 students and each trip costing $7, the total cost is:\n\\[ 20 \\times 7 = 140 \\]\n\nSubtracting the total cost of the trip from the total fund gives us the amount left:\n\\[ 150 - 140 = 10 \\]\n\nFinal Answer: 10"
