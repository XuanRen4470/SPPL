        "In April, Natalia sold clips to 48 friends. In May, she sold half as many clips as in April, so she sold 48 * 0.5 = <<48*0.5=24>>24 clips.\n\nTherefore, Natalia sold a total of 48 + 24 = <<48+24=72>>72 clips in April and May.",
        "To find out how much Weng earned for babysitting for 50 minutes, we first need to determine how many hours this represents, and then calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.\n\nWe know that:\n1 hour = 60 minutes\n\nSo,\n50 minutes = 50 / 60 = 0.8333 hours\n\nNow, let's calculate her earnings:\nEarnings = Hourly rate * Hours worked\n\nEarnings = $12/hour * 0.8333 hours\n\nEarnings = $10.00 (approximately)\n\nSo, Weng earned approximately $10 for babysitting for 50 minutes.",
        "Betty's parents gave her $15, and her grandparents gave her twice that amount. So her grandparents gave her $15 * 2 = $30. Therefore, Betty has a total of $15 (from her parents) + $30 (from her grandparents) = $45. The wallet costs $100, so Betty still needs to find $100 - $45 = $55 to buy the wallet.",
        "Let's calculate the number of pages Julie has read so far and the number of pages she will read tomorrow:\n\n1. Yesterday, Julie read 12 pages.\n2. Today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday, so she read 12 * 2 = 24 pages.\n3. So far, she has read 12 + 24 = 36 pages.\n4. The book has 120 pages, so there are 120 - 36 = 84 pages left for Julie to read.\n5. Tomorrow, she wants to read half of the remaining pages, so she will read 84 / 2 = 42 pages.\n\nTherefore, Julie should read 42 pages tomorrow.",
        "James writes a 3-page letter to each friend twice a week. So, the total number of pages he writes per week for both friends is:\n\n3 pages/letter * 2 letters/friend * 2 friends = 12 pages/week\n\nTo find out how many pages he writes in a year, we need to multiply the weekly amount by the number of weeks in a year, which is 52:\n\n12 pages/week * 52 weeks/year = 624 pages/year.\n\nSo, James writes a total of 624 pages in a year.",
        "Let's denote the number of purple flowers as Y, and the number of green flowers as G. We know that there are 10 yellow flowers, and there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow, so there are 18 yellow flowers (10 x 1.8).\n\nWe also know that there are 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers combined. So, the number of green flowers is 0.25 * (10 + 18) = 6.5 * 18 = 117 (rounded up since we can't have a fraction of a flower).\n\nTherefore, the total number of flowers in Mark's garden is:\n\n10 (yellow) + 18 (purple) + 117 (green) = 135 flowers.",
        "Albert buys a total of 2 large pizzas * 16 slices each = <<2*16=32>>32 slices and 2 small pizzas * 8 slices each = <<2*8=16>>16 slices, so he buys a total of 32 + 16 = <<32+16=48>>48 slices of pizza. Therefore, if he eats it all, he will eat 48 pieces of pizza that day.",
        "Let's break down the weights of the different items added to the box:\n\n1. Jelly beans (first addition): 2 pounds\n2. Brownies: 2 pounds (initial weight) \u00d7 3 = 6 pounds\n3. Jelly beans (second addition): 2 pounds\n4. Gummy worms: Final weight \u00d7 2\n\nTo find the final weight, we need to add up all the weights:\n\n2 pounds (jelly beans, first addition) + 6 pounds (brownies) + 2 pounds (jelly beans, second addition) + (Final weight \u00d7 2) (gummy worms)\n\nCombine the jelly beans weights: 2 pounds + 2 pounds = 4 pounds\n\nNow, let's solve for the final weight:\n\nFinal weight \u00d7 2 = 6 pounds (brownies) + 4 pounds (jelly beans) + 2 pounds (initial weight)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nFinal weight = (6 pounds + 4 pounds + 2 pounds) / 2\n\nFinal weight = 12 pounds / 2\n\nFinal weight = 6 pounds\n\nSo, the final weight of the box of goodies was 6 pounds.",
        "To find out how much Alexis paid for the shoes, we need to determine how much she spent in total on all the other items and then subtract that amount from her budget to find the cost of the shoes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of all the items for which we have receipts:\n\nTotal cost = $30 (shirt) + $46 (pants) + $38 (coat) + $11 (socks) + $18 (belt)\n\nTotal cost = $133\n\nNow, we know that Alexis had a budget of $200 and spent $133 on the items we know about. So, we can find the cost of the shoes by subtracting the total cost of the known items from the budget:\n\nCost of shoes = Budget - Total cost\n\nCost of shoes = $200 - $133\n\nCost of shoes = $67\n\nTherefore, Alexis paid $67 for the shoes.",
        "To calculate Tina's earnings for working 10 hours a day for 5 days, we first need to find out how much she earns for the regular hours and the overtime hours.\n\nRegular hours: 10 hours/day * 5 days = 50 hours/week\n\nHer weekly wage for regular hours is: $18.00/hour * 50 hours = $900.00\n\nNext, we'll find out how many overtime hours she works each week:\n\nOvertime hours: 10 hours/day * 5 days = 50 hours/week\n\nHer weekly wage for overtime hours is: $18.00/hour * 50 hours * 1.5 (overtime rate) = $1,350.00\n\nFinally, we add her regular wage and overtime wage to find her total weekly earnings:\n\nTotal weekly earnings = $900.00 + $1,350.00 = $2,250.00\n\nTherefore, Tina makes $2,250.00 in a week when she works 10 hours every day for 5 days.",
        "Let's denote the number of people on the first ship as x. The number of people on the next ship (the one consumed 100 years later) would be 2x. The number of people on the third ship (consumed 200 years later) would be 2x * 2 = 4x.\n\nWe know that the total number of people consumed over the course of 300 years is 847. So we can set up the following equation:\n\nx + 2x + 4x = 847\n\nCombining the terms on the left side, we get:\n\n7x = 847\n\nNow we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 7:\n\nx = 847 / 7\nx \u2248 121.0714\n\nSince the number of people must be a whole number, the closest answer would be to round down to the nearest whole number:\n\nx = 120\n\nSo, there were approximately 120 people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years.",

He earns $7 for shoveling one driveway.\n5. After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how much Tobias earned from his allowance and lawn mowing jobs in the past three months:\n\nAllowance for 3 months = $5/month * 3 months = $15\nTotal earnings from lawn mowing = $15 (change) + $95 (shoes) = $110\n\nNow, let's find out how many lawns Tobias mowed:\n\nTotal earnings from lawn mowing = $110\nEarnings per lawn = $15\nNumber of lawns mowed = $110 / $15 = 7.33\nSince he can't mow a fraction of a lawn, he mowed 7 lawns.\n\nNow, let's find out how many driveways he shoveled:\n\nEarnings per driveway = $7\nTotal earnings from shoveling = $110 (total earnings) - $70 (earnings from lawn mowing) = $40\nNumber of driveways shoveled = $40 / $7 = 5.71\nSince he can't shovel a fraction of a driveway, he shoveled 5 driveways.",

He has 5 less than half as many coconut trees, so he has 60 mango trees + (1/2 * 60 mango trees - 5) coconut trees.\n\nLet's calculate the number of coconut trees:\n\nCoconut trees = 1/2 * 60 mango trees - 5\nCoconut trees = 30 mango trees - 5\nCoconut trees = 25 mango trees\n\nSo, Randy has a total of 60 mango trees + 25 coconut trees = 85 trees on his farm.",
        "Let's find out the cost of each ingredient:\n\n1. Cheddar cheese: 2 pounds = 4 pounds (since there are 2 pounds in 1 pound) = 4 pounds * $5 (half the price of a pound of cheddar) = $20\n2. Cream cheese: 1 pound = 2 pounds (since he bought twice the amount of cream cheese as cheddar) = 2 pounds * $5 (half the price of a pound of cheddar) = $10\n3. Cold cuts: 1 pound = 2 pounds (since it cost twice the price of cheddar) = 2 pounds * ($10 + $5) = $20\n\nSo, the total cost of the ingredients is $20 (cheddar) + $10 (cream cheese) + $20 (cold cuts) = $50.",

        "To calculate James' profit, we first need to determine the revenue he generates from selling the DVDs and then subtract the cost of producing each DVD.\n\n1. Find the profit per DVD: The DVD is sold for 2.5 times the production cost, so the profit per DVD is: $2.5/DVD * ($2000/1000 - $6/DVD)\n2. Calculate the number of DVDs sold in 20 weeks: 500 DVDs/day * 5 days/week * 20 weeks = 50,000 DVDs\n3. Calculate the total revenue: 50,000 DVDs * $2.5/DVD = $125,000\n4. Calculate the total cost: 50,000 DVDs * $6/DVD = $300,000\n5. Calculate the profit: $125,000 (revenue) - $300,000 (cost) = -$175,000\n\nHowever, the result shows a loss. This indicates that James is not making a profit with this pricing strategy. He would need to either reduce his production costs, increase the selling price, or sell more DVDs to make a profit.",

We know that Johnson received $2500, so we can set up an equation to find the total profit:\n\n5/7 * X = $2500\n\nTo find X, we need to solve for it:\n\nX = $2500 * (7/5)\nX = $3520\n\nNow we know the total profit. Mike's share is 2/7 of X, which is:\n\nMike's share = $3520 * (2/7)\nMike's share = $1760\n\nHowever, Mike spent $200 on a shirt, so his actual take-home amount is:\n\nMike's take-home = $1760 - $200\nMike's take-home = $1560",
        "First, let's find out how many pink hard hats are left after Carl and John have taken some away. Carl took 4 pink hard hats, so there are 22 pink hard hats left. John took 6 pink hard hats, so there are 16 pink hard hats left.\n\nNext, let's find out how many green hard hats John took. He took twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats he removed. So, John took 12 green hard hats (6 pink hard hats x 2).\n\nNow, let's add up all the remaining hard hats:\n\n- Pink hard hats: 16\n- Green hard hats: 15 (initial amount) - 12 (John took) = 3\n- Yellow hard hats: 24 (initial amount)\n\nSo, there are a total of 16 + 3 + 24 = 43 hard hats remaining in the truck.",
        "Let's calculate the total hours Roque spends getting to and from work each week:\n\n1. First, let's find out how many hours he spends walking each week. He walks three times a week, and it takes him two hours each time, so:\n   Walking hours per week = 3 (times per week) * 2 (hours per time) = 6 hours\n\n2. Next, let's find out how many hours he spends biking each week. He rides his bike twice a week, and it takes him one hour each time, so:\n   Biking hours per week = 2 (times per week) * 1 (hour per time) = 2 hours\n\n3. Finally, to find the total hours he spends getting to and from work each week, we add the walking hours and biking hours:\n   Total hours per week = 6 (hours walking) + 2 (hours biking) = 8 hours.\n\nSo, Roque takes a total of 8 hours to get to and from work each week with walking and biking.",
        "To find out how much time Tim spends biking a week, we first need to calculate the time he spends biking to and from work each day and the time he spends on his weekend ride.\n\nThe distance to and from work is 20 miles, so the round-trip distance is 40 miles. The time it takes to bike 40 miles at a speed of 25 mph can be calculated as follows:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 40 miles / 25 mph\nTime = 1.6 hours\n\nSince Tim bikes to and from work five days a week, the total time he spends biking to and from work each week is:\n\nTime = 1.6 hours / day * 5 days / week\nTime = 8 hours / week\n\nThe weekend ride is 200 miles long, so the time it takes to complete the ride can be calculated as follows:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 200 miles / 25 mph\nTime = 8 hours\n\nSo, the total time Tim spends biking a week is:\n\nTotal Time = Time to work + Time on weekend ride\nTotal Time = 8 hours / week + 8 hours\nTotal Time = 16 hours / week",

To find out how many gnomes the first four houses have together, we can multiply the number of houses by the number of gnomes per house: 4 houses * 3 gnomes/house = 12 gnomes.\n3. Now, we know that there are a total of 20 gnomes on the street. We've accounted for 12 gnomes from the first four houses.\n4. To find out how many gnomes are at the fifth house, we can subtract the number of gnomes we've accounted for from the total number of gnomes: 20 gnomes (total) - 12 gnomes (first four houses) = 8 gnomes.\n\nSo, the fifth house has 8 gnomes in its garden.",
