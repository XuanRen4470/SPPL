        "In April, Natalia sold clips to 48 friends. In May, she sold half as many clips as in April, so she sold 48 * 0.5 = <<48*0.5=24>>24 clips.\n\nTherefore, Natalia sold a total of 48 + 24 = <<48+24=72>>72 clips in April and May.\n\nFinal Answer: 72.0",
        "Let's calculate the number of pages Julie has read so far and the number of pages she will read tomorrow:\n\n1. Yesterday, Julie read 12 pages.\n2. Today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday, so she read 12 * 2 = 24 pages.\n3. So far, she has read 12 + 24 = 36 pages.\n4. The book has 120 pages, so there are 120 - 36 = 84 pages left for Julie to read.\n5. Tomorrow, she wants to read half of the remaining pages, so she will read 84 / 2 = 42 pages.\n\nTherefore, Julie should read 42 pages tomorrow.\n\nFinal Answer: 42.0",
        "James writes a 3-page letter to each friend twice a week. So, the total number of pages he writes per week for both friends is:\n\n3 pages/letter * 2 letters/friend * 2 friends = 12 pages/week\n\nTo find out how many pages he writes in a year, we need to multiply the weekly amount by the number of weeks in a year, which is 52:\n\n12 pages/week * 52 weeks/year = 624 pages/year.\n\nSo, James writes a total of 624 pages in a year.\n\nFinal Answer: 624.0",
        "Albert buys a total of 2 large pizzas * 16 slices each = <<2*16=32>>32 slices and 2 small pizzas * 8 slices each = <<2*8=16>>16 slices, so he buys a total of 32 + 16 = <<32+16=48>>48 slices of pizza. Therefore, if he eats it all, he will eat 48 pieces of pizza that day.\n\nFinal Answer: 48.0",
        "Let's break down Tobias' expenses and income:\n\n1. Tobias spends $95 on shoes.\n2. He has a monthly allowance of $5.\n3. He earns $15 for mowing one lawn.\n4. He earns $7 for shoveling one driveway.\n5. After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how much Tobias earned from his allowance and lawn mowing jobs in the past three months:\n\nAllowance for 3 months = $5/month * 3 months = $15\nTotal earnings from lawn mowing = $15 (change) + $95 (shoes) = $110\n\nNow, let's find out how many lawns Tobias mowed:\n\nTotal earnings from lawn mowing = $110\nEarnings per lawn = $15\nNumber of lawns mowed = $110 / $15 = 7.33\nSince he can't mow a fraction of a lawn, he mowed 7 lawns.\n\nNow, let's find out how many driveways he shoveled:\n\nEarnings per driveway = $7\nTotal earnings from shoveling = $110 (total earnings) - $70 (earnings from lawn mowing) = $40\nNumber of driveways shoveled = $40 / $7 = 5.71\nSince he can't shovel a fraction of a driveway, he shoveled 5 driveways.\n\nFinal Answer: 5.0",
        "Randy has 60 mango trees. He has 5 less than half as many coconut trees, so he has 60 mango trees + (1/2 * 60 mango trees - 5) coconut trees.\n\nLet's calculate the number of coconut trees:\n\nCoconut trees = 1/2 * 60 mango trees - 5\nCoconut trees = 30 mango trees - 5\nCoconut trees = 25 mango trees\n\nSo, Randy has a total of 60 mango trees + 25 coconut trees = 85 trees on his farm.\n\nFinal Answer: 85.0",
        "First, let's find out how many pink hard hats are left after Carl and John have taken some away. Carl took 4 pink hard hats, so there are 22 pink hard hats left. John took 6 pink hard hats, so there are 16 pink hard hats left.\n\nNext, let's find out how many green hard hats John took. He took twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats he removed. So, John took 12 green hard hats (6 pink hard hats x 2).\n\nNow, let's add up all the remaining hard hats:\n\n- Pink hard hats: 16\n- Green hard hats: 15 (initial amount) - 12 (John took) = 3\n- Yellow hard hats: 24 (initial amount)\n\nSo, there are a total of 16 + 3 + 24 = 43 hard hats remaining in the truck.\n\nFinal Answer: 43.0",
        "To find out how much time Tim spends biking a week, we first need to calculate the time he spends biking to and from work each day and the time he spends on his weekend ride.\n\nThe distance to and from work is 20 miles, so the round-trip distance is 40 miles. The time it takes to bike 40 miles at a speed of 25 mph can be calculated as follows:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 40 miles / 25 mph\nTime = 1.6 hours\n\nSince Tim bikes to and from work five days a week, the total time he spends biking to and from work each week is:\n\nTime = 1.6 hours / day * 5 days / week\nTime = 8 hours / week\n\nThe weekend ride is 200 miles long, so the time it takes to complete the ride can be calculated as follows:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 200 miles / 25 mph\nTime = 8 hours\n\nSo, the total time Tim spends biking a week is:\n\nTotal Time = Time to work + Time on weekend ride\nTotal Time = 8 hours / week + 8 hours\nTotal Time = 16 hours / week\n\nFinal Answer: 16.0",
        "Let's find out how many stamps Bella bought for each design:\n\n1. Snowflake stamps: Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps.\n2. Truck stamps: Bella bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so she bought 11 + 9 = 20 truck stamps.\n3. Rose stamps: Bella bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so she bought 20 - 13 = 7 rose stamps.\n\nNow let's calculate the total number of stamps Bella bought:\n\nTotal stamps = Snowflake stamps + Truck stamps + Rose stamps\nTotal stamps = 11 + 20 + 7\nTotal stamps = 38\n\nSo, Bella bought a total of 38 stamps.\n\nFinal Answer: 38.0",
        "Let's first find out how much Ann spent on the shorts and shoes:\n\nCost of shorts = Number of pairs * Price per pair\n              = 5 pairs * $7/pair\n              = $35\n\nCost of shoes = Number of pairs * Price per pair\n             = 2 pairs * $10/pair\n             = $20\n\nNow, let's find out how much Ann spent on the tops:\n\nTotal amount spent = Cost of shorts + Cost of shoes + Cost of tops\n                  = $35 + $20 + Cost of tops\n\nWe know that Ann spent a total of $75, so:\n\n$75 = $35 + $20 + Cost of tops\nCost of tops = $75 - ($35 + $20)\n            = $75 - $55\n            = $20\n\nSince Ann bought 4 tops, the cost of each top is:\n\nCost per top = Cost of all tops / Number of tops\n            = $20 / 4\n            = $5\n\nSo, each top cost $5.\n\nFinal Answer: 5.0",
        "First, let's find out how many tennis balls Ralph hit from each group.\n\nFor the first 100 balls:\nNumber of hits = 2/5 * 100 = 40 balls\n\nFor the next 75 balls:\nNumber of hits = 1/3 * 75 = 25 balls\n\nNow, let's find out how many tennis balls Ralph did not hit:\n\nTotal number of balls = 100 + 75 = 175\nNumber of hits = 40 + 25 = 65\n\nSo, the number of tennis balls Ralph did not hit is:\n\nTotal number of balls - Number of hits = 175 - 65 = 110 tennis balls.\n\nFinal Answer: 110.0",
        "To find out how much salt Jack will get, we first need to determine how much salt is in the 2 liters of seawater. We know that the seawater is 20% salt, so we can calculate the amount of salt by finding 20% of the total volume of water.\n\nFirst, let's convert the volume of water from liters to milliliters since the final answer is required in milliliters:\n\n1 liter = 1000 milliliters\n2 liters = 2 * 1000 = 2000 milliliters\n\nNow, let's calculate the amount of salt in the seawater:\n\nSalt = Total volume of water * Percentage of salt\nSalt = 2000 milliliters * 0.2\nSalt = 400 milliliters\n\nSo, Jack will get 400 milliliters of salt when all the water evaporates.\n\nFinal Answer: 400.0",
        "Let's reason through this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. We know that there are 5 houses, and the first four houses each have 3 gnomes.\n2. To find out how many gnomes the first four houses have together, we can multiply the number of houses by the number of gnomes per house: 4 houses * 3 gnomes/house = 12 gnomes.\n3. Now, we know that there are a total of 20 gnomes on the street. We've accounted for 12 gnomes from the first four houses.\n4. To find out how many gnomes are at the fifth house, we can subtract the number of gnomes we've accounted for from the total number of gnomes: 20 gnomes (total) - 12 gnomes (first four houses) = 8 gnomes.\n\nSo, the fifth house has 8 gnomes in its garden.\n\nFinal Answer: 8.0"
