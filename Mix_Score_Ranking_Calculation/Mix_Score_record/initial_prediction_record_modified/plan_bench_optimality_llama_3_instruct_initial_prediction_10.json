        "Let's analyze the initial state and the goal.\n\nInitial state:\n\n* The blue block is clear\n* The hand is empty\n* The blue block is on top of the orange block\n* The orange block is on top of the yellow block\n* The yellow block is on top of the red block\n* The red block is on the table\n\nGoal:\n\n* The red block is on top of the orange block\n* The yellow block is on top of the red block\n\nTo achieve the goal, we need to move the blocks around. Here's a plan:\n\n[PLAN]\n1. Pick up the yellow block (1 minute)\n2. Unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block (1 minute)\n3. Put down the yellow block (1 minute)\n4. Pick up the red block (1 minute)\n5. Stack the red block on top of the orange block (1 minute)\n6. Pick up the yellow block (1 minute)\n7. Stack the yellow block on top of the red block (1 minute)\n\nTotal time: 7 minutes\n\nThis plan achieves the goal by moving the blocks in the correct order. We first pick up the yellow block, then unstack it from the red block, put it down, pick up the red block, stack it on top of the orange block, pick up the yellow block again, and finally stack it on top of the red block.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up yellow)\n(unstack yellow red)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red orange)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)",
        "I'd be happy to help you solve the problem.\n\nSince the initial conditions are different from the original problem, we need to analyze the new situation and find the optimal plan to achieve the goal.\n\nHere's my analysis:\n\n1. The yellow block is clear, so we can pick it up.\n2. The red block is on top of the orange block, and the orange block is on top of the blue block. We need to unstack the red block from the orange block.\n3. After unstacking the red block, we need to put it down to make the orange block clear.\n4. Then, we can pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the yellow block.\n5. Next, we need to unstack the blue block from the yellow block and put it down to make the yellow block clear.\n6. Finally, we can pick up the blue block and stack it on top of the red block.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n[PLAN]\npick up the yellow block\nunstack the red block from on top of the orange block\nput down the red block\npick up the orange block\nstack the orange block on top of the yellow block\nunstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block\nput down the blue block\npick up the blue block\nstack the blue block on top of the red block\n[PLAN END]\n\nThe total time to execute this plan is 8 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up yellow)\n(unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue red)"
