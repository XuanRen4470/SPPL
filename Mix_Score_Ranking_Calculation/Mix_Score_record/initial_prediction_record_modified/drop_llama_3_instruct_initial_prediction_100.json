        "Based on the passage, the percentages of people who are not American are:\n\n* 9.27% Asian\n* 0.23% Native American\n* 1.52% African\n* 0.06% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander\n* 1.47% Two or more races (assuming some of these individuals may not identify as American)\n\nAdding these up, we get 12.55%. This means that 12.55% of the population is not American.\n\nHowever, the passage also mentions that 8.1% of the population identified as \"American\". This means that the percentage of people who are not American is actually:\n\n100% - 8.1% = 91.9%\n\nSo, approximately 91.9% of the population is not American.",
        "According to the passage, 6.0% of the population had Polish ancestry. To find the percentage of people who were not Polish, you can subtract this percentage from 100%:\n\n100% - 6.0% = 94.0%\n\nSo, 94.0% of the population were not Polish.",
        "Based on the passage, 1.47% of the population were from two or more races. To find the percentage of people who were not from two or more races, we can subtract this percentage from 100%:\n\n100% - 1.47% = 98.53%\n\nSo, approximately 98.53% of the population were not from two or more races."
