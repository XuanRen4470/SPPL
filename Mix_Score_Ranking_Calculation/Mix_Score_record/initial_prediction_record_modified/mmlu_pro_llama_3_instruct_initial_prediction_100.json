        "The correct answer is (E): \"It prevents the moons from colliding with each other.\"\n\nThe 1:2:4 resonance in the Jupiter's moons system refers to the orbital period ratio between Io, Europa, and Ganymede, which are the three largest moons of Jupiter. The resonance means that for every one orbit of Io around Jupiter, Europa orbits twice, and Ganymede orbits four times. This resonance prevents the moons from colliding with each other, as their orbits are synchronized to maintain a stable distance from each other.\n\nThis resonance is thought to have arisen due to gravitational interactions between the moons and Jupiter, and it has played a crucial role in shaping the evolution of the Jupiter's moons system.",

        "I'd be happy to help!\n\nThe correct answer is (A): \"They reflect enough of the sun's light to make them brighter than most background stars\".\n\nAsteroids are typically small and dark, but they can reflect enough sunlight to make them stand out against the background of fainter stars. This is because asteroids are rocky bodies that have a high albedo (reflectivity), which means they can reflect a significant amount of sunlight. This makes them visible to telescopes and other sky survey instruments, even from great distances.",

        "The correct answer is (A): \"Large meteorites disintegrate in the Earth's atmosphere, creating smaller particles that cause a meteor shower.\"\n\nMeteor showers occur when small particles from space, such as meteoroids, enter the Earth's atmosphere and burn up, producing a bright streak of light in the sky, commonly known as a meteor or shooting star. The majority of meteoroids that cause meteor showers are small pieces of debris that break off from asteroids or comets and enter the Earth's atmosphere. As they enter the atmosphere, they are heated by friction and burn up, producing the bright streak of light that we see.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\n* Option B is incorrect because near-Earth asteroids do not disintegrate and spread out along their orbital paths. Instead, they can be responsible for producing meteor showers when they enter the Earth's atmosphere.\n* Option C is incorrect because asteroid impacts elsewhere in the solar system do not throw sand-sized particles into space that can cause meteor showers.\n* Option D is incorrect because the disintegration of planets in our solar system does not produce the small particles that cause meteor showers.\n* Option E is incorrect because the gravitational pull of the moon does not cause rocks on its surface to be ejected into space and enter the Earth's atmosphere.\n* Option F is incorrect because meteor showers are not caused by the Earth passing through the tail of a comet.\n* Option G is incorrect because the disintegration of distant stars does not produce the small particles that cause meteor showers.\n* Option H is incorrect because near-Earth asteroids do not disintegrate as they enter the Earth's atmosphere, creating hundreds of bright meteors that appear to radiate from a single location in the sky.\n* Option I is incorrect because the disintegration of satellites and space debris does not produce the small particles that cause meteor showers.\n* Option J is incorrect because the nuclei of comets do not gradually disintegrate and spread out along their orbital paths. Instead, comets can produce meteor showers when they enter the Earth's atmosphere.",

This is because the light is reflected off the top and bottom surfaces of the oil layer, and the path difference between the two reflected beams is equal to the thickness of the oil layer.\n\nSince the oil layer is thin (500 nm), we can assume that the path difference is small compared to the wavelength of light.

        "I'd be happy to help!\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The meterstick on one spaceship is measured to be 60 cm long by an occupant of the other spaceship. This means that the length of the meterstick is contracted due to special relativity.\n2. Since the meterstick is contracted, its length is measured to be 60 cm, which is shorter than its proper length of 1 meter.\n3. This means that the relative speed between the two spaceships is significant, causing the length contraction.\n4. Since the speeds are equal and opposite, the relative speed between the two spaceships is twice the speed of each spaceship.\n5. The relative speed is equal to the speed of light times the gamma factor (\u03b3), which is given by:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the relative speed and c is the speed of light.\n\n6. Since the length contraction is significant, the gamma factor is close to 1.5 (which is approximately the square root of 2).\n7.

We can write:\n\np = mv\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for force, we get:\n\nF = dp/dt = d(mv)/dt\n\nSince the mass of the electron is constant, we can pull it out of the derivative:\n\nF = m * dv/dt\n\nNow, we can use the equation for acceleration:\n\na = dv/dt\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for force, we get:\n\nF = m * a\n\nSubstituting the values we know, we get:\n\nF = (-1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 C) * (10^8 cm/sec) / (10^-7 sec)\n\nF = 1.6 \u00d7 10^-7 N\n\nNow, we can use the equation:\n\nE = F / q\n\nSubstituting the values we know, we get:\n\nE = 1.6 \u00d7 10^-7 N / (-1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 C)\n\nE = 1 \u00d7 10^2 statV/cm\n\nFinally, we can use the equation:\n\nV = Ed\n\nSubstituting the values we know, we get:\n\nV = 1 \u00d7 10^2 statV/cm * 10 cm\n\nV = 10 statV\n\nConverting this to volts, we get:\n\nV = 10 statV / 3.3 \u00d7 10^4 statV/V = 0.3 V\n\nSo, the correct option is:\n\n(C): \"3.0 \u00d7 10^-3 statV/cm and 10.0 V\"\n\nNote that the question asks for the electric field strength and the voltage between the two points, but it does not specify the direction of the electric field. In this problem, we are assuming that the electric field is pointing in the direction of motion, but in general, the electric field could be pointing in any direction.",

A 75 candlepower lamp emits 75 times as much light as a standard candle.\n\nThe illumination at a certain distance is measured in foot-candles, which is the amount of light that falls on a surface one foot square. Since the lamp is 5 feet away, the illumination would be 75 candlepower / 5 feet = 15 foot-candles.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the illumination 5 feet from the lamp, which means we need to find the illumination at the surface directly under the lamp. This is given by the formula:\n\nIllumination (in foot-candles) = Candlepower (in candlepower) / Distance (in feet)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nIllumination = 75 candlepower / 5 feet = 15 foot-candles\n\nSo the correct answer is indeed (A): \"5 foot-candles\".",

This means the craft is in a state of constant upward acceleration, opposite to the downward acceleration due to gravity.\n2. The gravitational acceleration on the moon is g/6, which means the craft needs to accelerate upward by g/6 to hover.\n3. The exhaust velocity is 2000 m/s, but only 20% of the total mass is fuel. This means the fuel can only provide a certain amount of upward acceleration.\n4. Let's assume the total mass of the craft is M. Then, the mass of the fuel is 0.2M.\n5. The thrust provided by the fuel is equal to the mass of the fuel times the exhaust velocity. So, the thrust is 0.2M \u00d7 2000 m/s = 400M m/s.\n6. Since the craft is hovering, the thrust must equal the downward force due to gravity. The downward force is the mass of the craft times the gravitational acceleration: M \u00d7 (g/6).\n7. Equating the thrust and the downward force, we get: 400M m/s = M \u00d7 (g/6)\n8. Simplifying the equation, we get: 400 = g/3\n9. Rearranging the equation to solve for time, we get: t = (3g)/400\n\nNow, let's plug in the value of g (which is 9.8 m/s^2 on Earth, but we're dealing with the moon, so it's g/6 = 1.63 m/s^2).
