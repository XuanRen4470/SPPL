        "Let's analyze the situation and come up with a plan to achieve the goal.\n\nFirst, let's examine the initial conditions:\n\n* The yellow block is clear, white block is clear, black block is clear, and violet block is clear.\n* The hand is empty.\n* The yellow block, white block, black block, and violet block are all on the table.\n\nOur goal is to have the yellow block on top of the violet block, the white block on top of the yellow block, and the black block on top of the white block.\n\nHere's a possible plan:\n\n1. Pick up the yellow block (since it's clear and the hand is empty).\n2. Stack the yellow block on top of the violet block (since the violet block is clear).\n3. Pick up the white block (since it's clear and the hand is empty).\n4. Stack the white block on top of the yellow block (since the yellow block is clear).\n5. Pick up the black block (since it's clear and the hand is empty).\n6. Stack the black block on top of the white block (since the white block is clear).\n\nThis plan should achieve the desired goal.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow violet)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white yellow)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black white)"
