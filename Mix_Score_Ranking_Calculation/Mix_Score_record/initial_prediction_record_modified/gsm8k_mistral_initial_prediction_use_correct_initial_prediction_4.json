        "In April, Natalia sold clips to 48 friends. In May, she sold half as many clips as in April, so she sold 48 * 0.5 = <<48*0.5=24>>24 clips.\n\nTherefore, Natalia sold a total of 48 + 24 = <<48+24=72>>72 clips in April and May.\n\nFinal Answer: 72.0",
        "Let's calculate the number of pages Julie has read so far and the number of pages she will read tomorrow:\n\n1. Yesterday, Julie read 12 pages.\n2. Today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday, so she read 12 * 2 = 24 pages.\n3. So far, she has read 12 + 24 = 36 pages.\n4. The book has 120 pages, so there are 120 - 36 = 84 pages left for Julie to read.\n5. Tomorrow, she wants to read half of the remaining pages, so she will read 84 / 2 = 42 pages.\n\nTherefore, Julie should read 42 pages tomorrow.\n\nFinal Answer: 42.0"
