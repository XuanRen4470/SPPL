        "To solve the problem, we start by noting that a hexagon inscribed in a circle has equal opposite angles and the sides subtend equal angles at the center of the circle. Let the hexagon be \\(ABCDEF\\) with \\(AB = 31\\) and the other five sides equal to 81. \n\nSince the hexagon is inscribed in a circle, the circle's radius \\(R\\) can be determined using the length of the sides. The key is to use the fact that the sides of the hexagon subtend equal angles at the center of the circle. Let's denote the center of the circle as \\(O\\).\n\nThe length of each side of the hexagon is the chord length of the circle. The chord length formula is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Chord length} = 2R \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\]\nwhere \\(\\theta\\) is the central angle subtended by the chord.\n\nFor the sides of length 81, we have:\n\\[ 81 = 2R \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\]\nFor the side of length 31, we have:\n\\[ 31 = 2R \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\phi}{2}\\right) \\]\nwhere \\(\\phi\\) is the central angle subtended by the side \\(AB\\).\n\nSince the hexagon has five sides of equal length and one different side, the angles \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\phi\\) must be such that the sum of the angles around the circle is \\(360^\\circ\\).

        "To solve the problem, we start by using the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that the angle bisector of \\(\\angle A\\) in triangle \\(ABC\\) divides the opposite side \\(BC\\) into segments proportional to the adjacent sides.

Then, \\(BC = BD + DC = 31k\\).\n\nNext, we use mass points to find the ratio \\(CP:PA\\). Assign mass points to the vertices of the triangle as follows: assign a mass of 11 to \\(B\\) and a mass of 20 to \\(C\\) because \\(BD:DC = 20:11\\). This means that the mass of \\(D\\) is \\(11 + 20 = 31\\).\n\nSince \\(M\\) is the midpoint of \\(AD\\), the mass of \\(A\\) must be 31 to balance the mass at \\(D\\). Therefore, the mass of \\(A\\) is 31, and the mass of \\(M\\) is also 31.\n\nNow, we need to find the mass of \\(P\\), the intersection of \\(BM\\) and \\(AC\\). The mass of \\(B\\) is 11 and the mass of \\(M\\) is 31, so the mass of \\(P\\) is the sum of the effective masses along \\(BM\\) and \\(AC\\). Since \\(M\\) is the midpoint of \\(AD\\), the mass of \\(P\\) on \\(AC\\) is the sum of the masses of \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) scaled by the ratio of the segments \\(CP\\) and \\(PA\\).\n\nThe mass of \\(P\\) is the sum of the effective masses from \\(B\\) and \\(M\\), which is \\(11 + 31 = 42\\). The mass of \\(P\\) is also the sum of the effective masses from \\(A\\) and \\(C\\), which is \\(31 + 11 = 42\\).

        "To solve the problem, we start by noting that \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are the feet of the perpendiculars from \\(C\\) to \\(AB\\) and from \\(B\\) to \\(AC\\) respectively.

The line \\(PQ\\) is the orthic axis of the triangle \\(ABC\\).\n\nSince \\(PQ\\) intersects the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABC\\) at points \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), we can use the Power of a Point theorem at point \\(P\\) and point \\(Q\\).

The orthic axis \\(PQ\\) is the line through the feet of the altitudes, and it is known that \\(PQ\\) is perpendicular to the Euler line of the triangle. The points \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are the intersections of the orthic axis with the circumcircle, and they are symmetric with respect to the midpoint of the arc \\(BC\\) not containing \\(A\\).\n\nThe length of the orthic axis \\(PQ\\) in terms of the sides of the triangle is given by:\n\\[ PQ = 4R \\cos A \\cos B \\cos C \\]\nwhere \\(R\\) is the circumradius of \\(\\triangle ABC\\).\n\nUsing the fact that \\(XP \\cdot PY = PA \\cdot PB\\) and \\(QX \\cdot QY = QA \\cdot QC\\), we can use the relationship between the sides and the circumradius.

We know that a square \\(ABCD\\) has two pairs of identical isosceles triangles cut off, leaving a rectangle \\(PQRS\\). The total area of the triangles cut off is \\(200 \\text{ m}^2\\).\n\nLet the side length of the square be \\(s\\). Each isosceles triangle cut off has an area of \\(\\frac{200}{4} = 50 \\text{ m}^2\\).\n\nConsider one of the isosceles triangles, say \\(\\triangle APS\\). Since \\(\\triangle APS\\) is isosceles with \\(AP = AS\\), and the area of \\(\\triangle APS\\) is 50 \\(\\text{m}^2\\), we can use the area formula for a triangle:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n\\]\nLet \\(AP = AS = x\\). The base of \\(\\triangle APS\\) is \\(PS = s - (2 \\times \\text{height})\\). However, since \\(AP\\) and \\(AS\\) are equal and the triangle is isosceles, the height from \\(A\\) to \\(PS\\) splits \\(PS\\) into two equal segments. Let the height from \\(A\\) to \\(PS\\) be \\(h\\). Then:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times s \\times h = 50\n\\]\n\\[\ns \\times h = 100\n\\]\n\nSince \\(h\\) is the height from \\(A\\) to \\(PS\\), and \\(PS\\) is parallel to \\(BC\\), the height \\(h\\) is also the distance from \\(A\\) to the line \\(PS\\). This distance is the same for all triangles cut off, and it splits the square into the rectangle \\(PQRS\\) and four identical isosceles triangles.\n\nLet the width of the rectangle \\(PQRS\\) be \\(w\\) and the height be \\(h\\). Since the total area of the square is \\(s^2\\) and the area of the four triangles is \\(200 \\text{ m}^2\\), the area of the rectangle \\(PQRS\\) is:\n\\[\ns^2 - 200\n\\]\n\nThe width \\(w\\) of the rectangle is \\(s - 2h\\) and the height \\(h\\) is the same for all triangles.

By testing possible values, we find:\n\\[\ns = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, the side length of the square is \\(20 \\text{ m}\\). The length of the diagonal \\(PR\\) of the rectangle \\(PQRS\\) is:\n\\[\nPR = \\sqrt{w^2 + h^2}\n\\]\nSince \\(w = s - 2h\\) and \\(h = \\frac{100}{s}\\):\n\\[\nw = 20 - 2 \\times \\frac{100}{20} = 20 - 10 = 10\n\\]\n\\[\nh = \\frac{100}{20} = 5\n\\]\n\\[\nPR = \\sqrt{10^2 + 5^2} = \\sqrt{100 + 25} = \\sqrt{125} = 5\\sqrt{5}\n\\]\n\nThus, the length of \\(PR\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{10\\sqrt{5}}\n\\]",

The formula for the area of a triangle is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n\\]\n\nGiven the base is 8 inches and the height is 10 inches, the area of the triangle is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 \\times 10 = 40 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\nSince the triangle is to be divided into 8 pieces of equal area, each piece will have an area of:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of each piece} = \\frac{40}{8} = 5 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to consider the shape of the pieces. The triangle is divided by lines from the vertex opposite the base to the points that divide the base into 8 equal segments. Each segment of the base is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length of each segment} = \\frac{8}{8} = 1 \\text{ inch}\n\\]\n\nThe lines from the vertex to these points will form 8 smaller triangles and 4 quadrilaterals. The smaller triangles will have equal areas of 5 square inches. The quadrilaterals can be divided into triangles to make the area calculation easier.\n\nTo find the perimeter of one of these pieces, we need to calculate the lengths of the sides. The height of each smaller triangle can be found using similar triangles. The height of the original triangle is 10 inches, and the base is divided into 8 segments of 1 inch each. The height of each smaller triangle is proportional to the base length. For the first smaller triangle (with base 1 inch):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Height of the first smaller triangle} = \\frac{1}{8} \\times 10 = 1.25 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nThe hypotenuse of this triangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Hypotenuse} = \\sqrt{1^2 + 1.25^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1.5625} = \\sqrt{2.5625} \\approx 1.60 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nThe next smaller triangle will have a base of 2 inches, and its height will be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Height of the second smaller triangle} = \\frac{2}{8} \\times 10 = 2.5 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nThe hypotenuse of this triangle is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Hypotenuse} = \\sqrt{2^2 + 2.5^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 6.25} = \\sqrt{10.25} \\approx 3.20 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nContinuing this pattern, the hypotenuse of the largest smaller triangle (with base 8 inches) will be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Height of the largest smaller triangle} = \\frac{8}{8} \\times 10 = 10 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nThe hypotenuse of this triangle is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Hypotenuse} = \\sqrt{8^2 + 10^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 100} = \\sqrt{164} \\approx 12.81 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nThe perimeter of the largest piece (which includes the base of 8 inches and the two hypotenuses of the largest smaller triangles) is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 8 + 12.81 + 12.81 = 33.62 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the greatest perimeter among the eight pieces is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{33.62}\n\\]",
        "To solve this problem, we need to first understand the configuration of the pentagon formed by cutting a triangular corner from a rectangle. The pentagon will have four sides that are the sides of the original rectangle and one side that is the hypotenuse of the triangle that was cut off. The five sides of the pentagon are the four sides of the rectangle minus the two sides of the triangle that were cut off, plus the hypotenuse of the triangle.\n\nGiven the side lengths of the pentagon are 13, 19, 20, 25, and 31, we need to determine which of these lengths correspond to the sides of the rectangle and the hypotenuse of the triangle. The hypotenuse of the triangle must be the longest side of the pentagon, which is 31. Therefore, the sides of the rectangle must be 13, 19, 20, and 25, and the hypotenuse of the triangle is 31.\n\nNow, we need to verify that the sides 13, 19, 20, and 25 can form a right triangle. We check if \\(13^2 + 20^2 = 25^2\\):\n\\[13^2 + 20^2 = 169 + 400 = 569 \\neq 625 = 25^2.\\]\nThis is not a right triangle, so we need to check the other combinations. Instead, we check if \\(13^2 + 25^2 = 20^2 + 19^2\\):\n\\[13^2 + 25^2 = 169 + 625 = 794,\\]\n\\[20^2 + 19^2 = 400 + 361 = 761.\\]\nThis is not equal either. However, we can use the fact that the sides 13, 19, 20, and 25 can form a right triangle with the hypotenuse 25, and the other side is 20, and the remaining sides are 13 and 19. So the sides of the rectangle are 19 and 25, and the sides of the triangle are 13 and 20.\n\nThe area of the original rectangle is:\n\\[19 \\times 25 = 475.\\]\nThe area of the triangle that was cut off is:\n\\[\\frac{1}{2} \\times 13 \\times 20 = 130.\\]\nTherefore, the area of the pentagon is:\n\\[475 - 130 = 345.\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{345}\n\\]",

This means that the height from \\(A\\) to \\(GD\\) (which is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \\(AGD\\)) is split into two segments: one part is the height of the square \\(s\\) and the other part is the remaining height of the triangle above the square.\n\nThe height of the right triangle \\(AGD\\) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. The length of \\(AD\\) is \\(40 - 7 = 33\\) units. Therefore, the height \\(AG\\) is:\n\\[\nAG = \\sqrt{AB^2 + AD^2} = \\sqrt{28^2 + 33^2} = \\sqrt{784 + 1089} = \\sqrt{1873}\n\\]\n\nSince the square \\(BCFE\\) is inscribed, the height of the triangle above the square is \\(AG - s\\). The remaining part of the base \\(CD\\) that is not covered by the square is \\(CD - s = 58 - s\\). The smaller triangle above the square is similar to the original triangle \\(AGD\\), and the ratio of the corresponding sides is the same. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion:\n\\[\n\\frac{AG - s}{AG} = \\frac{58 - s}{58}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(AG = \\sqrt{1873}\\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{1873} - s}{\\sqrt{1873}} = \\frac{58 - s}{58}\n\\]\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\\[\n58(\\sqrt{1873} - s) = 58\\sqrt{1873} - s\\sqrt{1873}\n\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\n58\\sqrt{1873} - 58s = 58\\sqrt{1873} - s\\sqrt{1873}\n\\]\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\\[\n58s = s\\sqrt{1873}\n\\]\nSolving for \\(s\\), we get:\n\\[\ns(\\sqrt{1873} - 58) = 0\n\\]\nSince \\(s \\neq 0\\), we have:\n\\[\ns = \\frac{58 \\cdot 28}{58 + 28} = \\frac{58 \\cdot 28}{86} = \\frac{28 \\cdot 28}{43} = \\frac{784}{43}\n\\]\n\nThe area of the square \\(BCFE\\) is:\n\\[\ns^2 = \\left(\\frac{784}{43}\\right)^2 = \\frac{784^2}{43^2} = \\frac{614656}{1849} = 332\n\\]\n\nThus, the area of square \\(BCFE\\) is \\(\\boxed{332}\\).",

Assume \\(A = (0, 0)\\), \\(B = (92, 0)\\), \\(D = (a, h)\\), and \\(C = (92 - a, h)\\). The center of the circle, which we will call \\(O\\), is on \\(\\overline{AB}\\), so we can write \\(O = (k, 0)\\) for some \\(k\\).\n\nSince the circle is tangent to \\(AD\\) and \\(BC\\), the distance from \\(O\\) to \\(AD\\) and \\(BC\\) is the radius \\(r\\) of the circle.

The horizontal distance from the center to the point where the height meets the leg is \\(\\frac{92 - 19}{2} = \\frac{73}{2} = 36.5\\).

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the possible triangles:**\n   - Since no face is equilateral, the possible triangles must have sides of lengths 18 and 41.\n   - The only possible triangles with sides 18 and 41 are isosceles triangles with sides 18, 18, 41 and 18, 41, 41. However, the triangle inequality theorem must be satisfied:\n     - For the triangle with sides 18, 18, 41: \\(18 + 18 = 36 < 41\\), so this is not a valid triangle.\n     - For the triangle with sides 18, 41, 41: \\(18 + 41 = 59 > 41\\), so this is a valid triangle.\n   - Therefore, each face of the pyramid must be an isosceles triangle with sides 18, 41, 41.\n\n2. **Determine the number of each type of triangle:**\n   - Since the pyramid has 4 triangular faces and each edge is shared by two faces, we need to count the edges. Each edge of the base triangle \\(PQR\\) is shared by two faces, and the edges \\(SP\\), \\(SQ\\), and \\(SR\\) are each shared by two faces.\n   - Let's denote the number of edges of length 18 by \\(x\\) and the number of edges of length 41 by \\(y\\). Since there are 6 edges in total, we have:\n     \\[\n     x + y = 6\n     \\]\n   - Each edge of length 18 is shared by two faces, and each edge of length 41 is also shared by two faces. Since there are 4 faces, the total number of edges counted by face edges is \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\). However, each edge is counted twice, so:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{x + y}{2} = 4 \\implies x + y = 8\n     \\]\n   - This is a contradiction because we already have \\(x + y = 6\\). Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the distribution.

The semi-perimeter \\(s\\) is:\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{18 + 41 + 41}{2} = 45\n     \\]\n   - The area \\(A\\) is:\n     \\[\n     A = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \\sqrt{45(45-18)(45-41)(45-41)} = \\sqrt{45 \\times 27 \\times 4 \\times 4} = \\sqrt{64800} = 360\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total surface area:**\n   - There are 4 faces, each with an area of 360, so the total surface area is:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 360 = 1440\n     \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1440}\n\\]",

Since the base is a square with sides of 10 inches, and the height of the pyramid is 12 inches, the smallest cube that can contain the pyramid must have a side length of at least 12 inches (to accommodate the height) and at least 10 inches (to accommodate the base width).\n\nTherefore, the smallest cube that can contain the pyramid must have a side length of 12 inches, as 12 inches is the greater of the two dimensions.\n\nThe volume \\(V\\) of a cube with side length \\(s\\) is given by the formula:\n\\[ V = s^3 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\(s = 12\\) inches into the formula:\n\\[ V = 12^3 = 12 \\times 12 \\times 12 = 1728 \\]\n\nFinal Answer: 1728",

        "To solve the problem, we will use the properties of similar triangles and the concept of mass points.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the given parallelogram \\(ABCD\\) with point \\(F\\) on the extension of side \\(AD\\). The line \\(BF\\) intersects diagonal \\(AC\\) at \\(E\\) and side \\(DC\\) at \\(G\\). We are given that \\(EF = 32\\) and \\(GF = 24\\).\n\n### Step 1: Use Similar Triangles\nSince \\(ABCD\\) is a parallelogram, \\(AB \\parallel CD\\) and \\(AD \\parallel BC\\). This means that \\(\\triangle BGF \\sim \\triangle BEA\\) by AA similarity (both triangles share \\(\\angle B\\) and \\(\\angle BGF = \\angle BEA\\) because they are corresponding angles).\n\n### Step 2: Set Up the Ratio\nFrom the similarity of triangles, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{EF}{GF} = \\frac{BE}{EA}\n\\]\nGiven \\(EF = 32\\) and \\(GF = 24\\), we can write:\n\\[\n\\frac{32}{24} = \\frac{BE}{EA}\n\\]\nSimplifying the ratio:\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{BE}{EA}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Use Mass Points\nTo find \\(BE\\), we assign mass points to the vertices.

This means \\(F\\) will have a mass of \\(3 + 4 = 7\\).\n\nSince \\(E\\) is on \\(AC\\), and \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are vertices of the parallelogram, we need to find the mass of \\(C\\). Because \\(ABCD\\) is a parallelogram, \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are equidistant from the midpoint of \\(BD\\), and thus \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) have the same mass. Therefore, \\(C\\) also has a mass of 3.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate \\(BE\\)\nThe mass of \\(E\\) is the sum of the masses of \\(A\\) and \\(C\\), which is \\(3 + 3 = 6\\). The mass of \\(B\\) is the sum of the masses of \\(A\\) and \\(D\\), which is \\(3 + 4 = 7\\).\n\nUsing the mass point ratio, the length \\(BE\\) is:\n\\[\nBE = \\frac{3}{3 + 4} \\times BF = \\frac{3}{7} \\times BF\n\\]\n\nSince \\(BF = BE + EF\\) and \\(EF = 32\\), we need to find \\(BF\\).

Setting the given circumference equal to the formula, we have:\n\\[\n2\\pi r = 12\\pi\n\\]\nDividing both sides by \\(2\\pi\\), we find:\n\\[\nr = 6 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\nSince \\(XY\\) is a diameter of the circle, its length is twice the radius:\n\\[\nXY = 2r = 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\nNext, we consider triangle \\(TXZ\\). Since \\(XY\\) is the diameter, angle \\(TXZ\\) is an inscribed angle that subtends the diameter \\(XY\\). According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, an angle subtended by a diameter is a right angle. However, the problem states that \\(\\angle TXZ = 60^\\circ\\), which means that \\(XZ\\) is not the diameter but a chord of the circle. We can use the Law of Cosines in triangle \\(TXZ\\) to find the length of \\(XZ\\).\n\nThe Law of Cosines states:\n\\[\nXZ^2 = TX^2 + TZ^2 - 2 \\cdot TX \\cdot TZ \\cdot \\cos(\\angle TXZ)\n\\]\nSince \\(TX\\) and \\(TZ\\) are both radii of the circle, we have \\(TX = TZ = 6\\) inches, and \\(\\angle TXZ = 60^\\circ\\). Substituting these values into the Law of Cosines, we get:\n\\[\nXZ^2 = 6^2 + 6^2 - 2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot \\cos(60^\\circ)\n\\]\nWe know that \\(\\cos(60^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2}\\), so:\n\\[\nXZ^2 = 36 + 36 - 2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 36 + 36 - 36 = 36\n\\]\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find:\n\\[\nXZ = \\sqrt{36} = 6\n\\]\nTherefore, the length of segment \\(XZ\\) is \\(\\boxed{6}\\) inches.",

The formula for the length of the median in terms of the sides of the triangle and the area is:\n\\[\nAD = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{2AB^2 + 2AC^2 - BC^2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{2(18x^2 + 200) - 400} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{36x^2 + 400 - 400} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{36x^2} = 3x.\n\\]\nThis confirms our earlier expression for \\(AD\\).\n\nThe area of triangle \\(ABC\\) can be found using the formula involving the inradius \\(r\\) and the semiperimeter \\(s\\):\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = r \\cdot s.\n\\]\nThe semiperimeter \\(s\\) is:\n\\[\ns = \\frac{AB + AC + BC}{2} = \\frac{AB + AC + 20}{2}.\n\\]\nThe inradius \\(r\\) can be found using the fact that the incircle trisects the median. The length of the segment from the vertex to the point where the incircle touches the opposite side is \\(s - BC/2 = s - 10\\). The length of the segment from the midpoint of the opposite side to the point where the incircle touches the opposite side is \\(s - AB/2 = s - AC/2\\). Since the incircle trisects the median, the distance from the vertex to the point where the incircle touches the opposite side is \\(2x\\), and the distance from the midpoint to the point where the incircle touches the opposite side is \\(x\\). This gives us the relationship:\n\\[\ns - 10 = 2x \\quad \\text{and} \\quad s - \\frac{AB}{2} = x.\n\\]\nFrom \\(s - 10 = 2x\\), we get \\(s = 2x + 10\\).

This means the second cut will intersect the first cut along a line that is at a \\(45^\\circ\\) angle to the axis of the cylinder.\n\n2. **Visualizing the Intersection:**\n   - The intersection of these two planes is a line that runs along the surface of the cylinder and forms a \\(45^\\circ\\) angle with the axis.

Then, the coordinates of points \\(E\\) and \\(F\\) are \\(E = (x,1)\\) and \\(F = (1,x)\\).\n\nWhen the square is folded along the lines \\(DE\\) and \\(DF\\), sides \\(AD\\) and \\(CD\\) coincide and lie on the diagonal \\(BD\\). This means that points \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are mapped to the same point on \\(BD\\), which is the line \\(y = -x + 1\\).\n\nFirst, we find the coordinates of the image of point \\(A\\) after folding along \\(DE\\). The line \\(DE\\) has the equation:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{1-0}{x-0}(x-0) + 0 = \\frac{x}{x}x = x\n\\]\nThe reflection of point \\(A = (0,1)\\) over the line \\(DE\\) can be found using the formula for the reflection of a point \\((x_1, y_1)\\) over a line \\(y = mx + c\\).

The total area of these triangles is \\(8 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times 1 = 4\\) square feet, but since the actual area removed is only 1 square foot, it means that the triangles are not all independent but are part of a larger configuration that results in a net area of 1 square foot removed.\n\nNow, let's calculate the perimeter of the region. The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all the outer edges. Starting from the bottom left corner and moving clockwise, the perimeter is composed of:\n- 9 feet along the bottom,\n- 6 feet along the right side,\n- 8 feet along the top (since the top is composed of 8 segments of 1 foot each),\n- 5 feet along the left side (since the left side is composed of 5 segments of 1 foot each).\n\nAdding these together, the perimeter is \\(9 + 6 + 8 + 5 = 28\\) feet.\n\nThus, the number of feet in the perimeter of the region is \\(\\boxed{28}\\).",

Since the paths are parallel and the building is centered, the line of sight between them is tangent to the building.\n\n### Step 3: Geometry of the Problem\nThe line of sight between Jenny and Kenny forms a right triangle with the building. The distance between the paths is 200 feet, and the radius of the building is 50 feet. The line of sight is tangent to the building, so the distance from the point of tangency to the line of sight is 50 feet.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Distance from the Point of Tangency to the Paths\nThe distance from the point of tangency to the paths can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.

Therefore, their relative speed is:\n\\[\n1 + 3 = 4 \\text{ feet per second}\n\\]\n\nThe total distance they need to cover to see each other again is the distance from the point of tangency to the paths, which is \\( 50\\sqrt{15} \\) feet.

        "To determine for how many values of \\( k \\) the triangle with sides \\( 11, 15, \\) and \\( k \\) is obtuse, we need to use the properties of obtuse triangles. A triangle is obtuse if the square of the length of one side is greater than the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nFirst, we need to ensure that the given lengths form a valid triangle. According to the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. This gives us the following inequalities:\n\n1. \\( 11 + 15 > k \\) which simplifies to \\( k < 26 \\)\n2. \\( 11 + k > 15 \\) which simplifies to \\( k > 4 \\)\n3. \\( 15 + k > 11 \\) which simplifies to \\( k > -4 \\) (this is always true since \\( k \\) is a positive integer)\n\nCombining the valid inequalities, we get \\( 4 < k < 26 \\). Therefore, \\( k \\) can be any integer from 5 to 25 inclusive. This gives us \\( 25 - 5 + 1 = 21 \\) possible values for \\( k \\).\n\nNext, we need to determine for which of these values the triangle is obtuse. We will consider three cases based on which side is the longest:\n\n**Case 1: \\( k \\) is the longest side.**\nThe triangle is obtuse if \\( k^2 > 11^2 + 15^2 \\). Calculating the right-hand side, we get:\n\\[ 11^2 + 15^2 = 121 + 225 = 346 \\]\nSo, \\( k^2 > 346 \\) or \\( k > \\sqrt{346} \\approx 18.6 \\). Since \\( k \\) is an integer, \\( k \\geq 19 \\). The possible values for \\( k \\) in this range are 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25. This gives us 7 values.\n\n**Case 2: 15 is the longest side.**\nThe triangle is obtuse if \\( 15^2 > 11^2 + k^2 \\). Calculating the right-hand side, we get:\n\\[ 11^2 + k^2 < 225 \\]\n\\[ 121 + k^2 < 225 \\]\n\\[ k^2 < 104 \\]\n\\[ k < \\sqrt{104} \\approx 10.2 \\]\nSince \\( k \\) is an integer, \\( k \\leq 10 \\). The possible values for \\( k \\) in this range are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. This gives us 6 values.\n\n**Case 3: 11 is the longest side.**\nThis case is not possible because \\( 11 \\) cannot be the longest side if \\( k \\) is in the range \\( 5 \\leq k \\leq 25 \\).\n\nAdding the number of valid values from both cases, we get \\( 7 + 6 = 13 \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of values of \\( k \\) for which the triangle is obtuse is \\(\\boxed{13}\\).",

This is because the circle is 1 unit away from each side on both sides, so the distance between the sides of the smaller triangle is \\(6-2=4\\), \\(8-2=6\\), and \\(10-2=8\\).\n\nThe perimeter of the smaller triangle is the sum of its sides:\n\\[\n4 + 6 + 8 = 18 - 6 = 12\n\\]\nThus, the distance that the center \\(P\\) travels is the perimeter of this smaller triangle, which is 12.\n\nTherefore, the distance that \\(P\\) has traveled when it first returns to its original position is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).\n\nFinal Answer: 12",

Since triangle \\(ABD\\) has a right angle at \\(A\\) and \\(AD = 12\\), point \\(D\\) must be directly above \\(A\\) on the y-axis, so \\(D\\) is at \\((0,15)\\).\n\nNext, we need to find the coordinates of point \\(E\\). Since \\(DE\\) is parallel to \\(AC\\), the slope of \\(DE\\) is the same as the slope of \\(AC\\). The slope of \\(AC\\) is \\(\\frac{3-0}{0-0}\\) which is undefined (vertical line), so \\(DE\\) is a horizontal line. Since \\(D\\) is at \\((0,15)\\), the equation of line \\(DE\\) is \\(y = 15\\).\n\nTo find the coordinates of \\(E\\), we need to find the intersection of the line \\(y = 15\\) with the line \\(CB\\). The equation of line \\(CB\\) can be found using the points \\(C(0,0)\\) and \\(B(4,0)\\), which is simply \\(y = 0\\).

The slope of \\(CB\\) is \\(\\frac{0-0}{4-0} = 0\\), so the equation of the line is \\(y = 0\\). But since we are extending it, we consider the line through \\(B\\) and the point at infinity, which is the x-axis extended. The coordinates of \\(E\\) will be \\((x,15)\\) where \\(x\\) is the x-coordinate of the intersection of the vertical line through \\(E\\) and the line \\(CB\\).\n\nSince \\(E\\) is on the extension of \\(CB\\), the coordinates of \\(E\\) are \\((x,15)\\) where \\(x\\) is such that the line through \\(E\\) and parallel to \\(AC\\) intersects the x-axis at \\(x = 16\\). Therefore, the coordinates of \\(E\\) are \\((16,15)\\).\n\nNow, we need to find the length of \\(DE\\) and \\(DB\\). The length of \\(DE\\) is the horizontal distance between \\(D\\) and \\(E\\), which is \\(16 - 0 = 16\\).

To rationalize the denominator, we get \\(\\frac{16\\sqrt{241}}{241}\\). Since 16 and 241 are relatively prime, the ratio is in its simplest form.

However, we can also break the quadrilateral into simpler shapes to find the area more easily.\n\nFirst, observe that the quadrilateral can be divided into two triangles. We can draw a vertical line from \\((2, 1)\\) to \\((1, 1)\\) and another vertical line from \\((2006, 2007)\\) to \\((2, 1)\\). This divides the quadrilateral into two triangles: one with vertices \\((1, 3)\\), \\((1, 1)\\), and \\((2, 1)\\), and the other with vertices \\((2, 1)\\), \\((2006, 2007)\\), and \\((2006, 1)\\).\n\nLet's calculate the area of the first triangle. The vertices are \\((1, 3)\\), \\((1, 1)\\), and \\((2, 1)\\). The base of this triangle is the horizontal distance between \\((1, 1)\\) and \\((2, 1)\\), which is 1.

Since circle \\(B\\) is internally tangent to circle \\(A\\) at one vertex of \\(T\\), the distance from the center of circle \\(A\\) to the center of circle \\(B\\) is:\n\\[\n10 - 3 = 7\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the distance from the center of circle \\(A\\) to the center of each of circles \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) is:\n\\[\n10 - 2 = 8\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the radius \\(r\\) of circle \\(E\\) that is externally tangent to circles \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\). Let the centers of circles \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) be \\(O_B\\), \\(O_C\\), and \\(O_D\\) respectively, and the center of circle \\(E\\) be \\(O_E\\). The distances from \\(O_E\\) to \\(O_B\\), \\(O_C\\), and \\(O_D\\) are \\(3 + r\\), \\(2 + r\\), and \\(2 + r\\) respectively.\n\nWe place the center of circle \\(A\\) at the origin \\((0,0)\\) and the vertices of the equilateral triangle \\(T\\) at \\((10, 0)\\), \\((5, 5\\sqrt{3})\\), and \\((-5, 5\\sqrt{3})\\). Without loss of generality, assume circle \\(B\\) is tangent at \\((10, 0)\\), circle \\(C\\) at \\((5, 5\\sqrt{3})\\), and circle \\(D\\) at \\((-5, 5\\sqrt{3})\\).\n\nThe coordinates of the centers are:\n\\[\nO_B = (10, 0), \\quad O_C = (5, 5\\sqrt{3}), \\quad O_D = (-5, 5\\sqrt{3})\n\\]\n\nUsing the distance formula, we set up the following equations for the distances from \\(O_E\\) to \\(O_B\\), \\(O_C\\), and \\(O_D\\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(x - 10)^2 + y^2} = 3 + r\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(x - 5)^2 + (y - 5\\sqrt{3})^2} = 2 + r\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(x + 5)^2 + (y - 5\\sqrt{3})^2} = 2 + r\n\\]\n\nSince the triangle is equilateral, the centers \\(O_C\\) and \\(O_D\\) are symmetric about the y-axis. Therefore, the x-coordinates of \\(O_C\\) and \\(O_D\\) are symmetric, and the y-coordinates are the same. This symmetry simplifies our calculations.\n\nWe solve the system of equations. First, square all three equations:\n\\[\n(x - 10)^2 + y^2 = (3 + r)^2\n\\]\n\\[\n(x - 5)^2 + (y - 5\\sqrt{3})^2 = (2 + r)^2\n\\]\n\\[\n(x + 5)^2 + (y - 5\\sqrt{3})^2 = (2 + r)^2\n\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\\[\nx^2 - 20x + 100 + y^2 = 9 + 6r + r^2\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 - 10x + 25 + y^2 - 10y\\sqrt{3} + 75 = 4 + 4r + r^2\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 + 10x + 25 + y^2 - 10y\\sqrt{3} + 75 = 4 + 4r + r^2\n\\]\n\nSubtract the second and third equations from the first:\n\\[\n-10x + 25 - 10y\\sqrt{3} + 75 = 5 + 2r\n\\]\n\\[\n10x + 25 - 10y\\sqrt{3} + 75 = 5 + 2r\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[\n-10x - 10y\\sqrt{3} + 100 = 5 + 2r\n\\]\n\\[\n10x - 10y\\sqrt{3} + 100 = 5 + 2r\n\\]\n\nAdd these two equations:\n\\[\n200 = 10 + 4r\n\\]\n\\[\n190 = 4r\n\\]\n\\[\nr = \\frac{190}{4} = \\frac{95}{2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the radius of circle \\(E\\) is \\(\\frac{95}{2}\\), and the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{101}\n\\]",
        "To determine the possible integer values of \\(x\\) for the sides of a non-degenerate triangle with lengths \\(x\\), 13, and 37, we need to use the triangle inequality theorem.
