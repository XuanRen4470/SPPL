        "To find the value of \\( x \\) that gives the minimum value for the quadratic function \\( f(x) = x^2 - 10x + 24 \\), we can use the vertex formula for a parabola. The vertex form of a quadratic function \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) gives the \\( x \\)-coordinate of the vertex as \\( x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\).\n\nFor the given function \\( f(x) = x^2 - 10x + 24 \\), the coefficients are:\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n- \\( b = -10 \\)\n- \\( c = 24 \\)\n\nUsing the vertex formula:\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{b}{2a} = -\\frac{-10}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( x \\) that gives the minimum value for the function is \\( x = 5 \\).\n\nTo confirm, we can complete the square for the quadratic function.

Take the coefficient of \\( x \\), which is \\(-10\\), divide it by 2, and square it:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{-10}{2}\\right)^2 = 25\n\\]\n\n2.

The minimum value of \\( (x - 5)^2 \\) is 0, which occurs when \\( x = 5 \\).\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( x \\) that gives the minimum value for \\( x^2 - 10x + 24 \\) is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
        "To determine the degree of \\( g(x) \\), we start by analyzing the given polynomial \\( h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x) \\).

Since \\( f(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree 2, when we substitute \\( g(x) \\) into \\( f(x) \\), the degree of \\( f(g(x)) \\) is determined by the degree of \\( g(x) \\). Specifically, if \\( \\deg(g(x)) = d \\), then the degree of \\( f(g(x)) \\) is \\( 2d \\).\n\nNext, consider the term \\( g(x) \\). The degree of \\( g(x) \\) is simply \\( d \\).\n\nThe degree of the sum of two polynomials is the maximum of their degrees, provided that the leading coefficients do not cancel each other out. Therefore, the degree of \\( h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x) \\) is the maximum of \\( 2d \\) and \\( d \\). Since we are given that the degree of \\( h(x) \\) is 6, we have:\n\\[\n\\max(2d, d) = 6\n\\]\nThis equation tells us that \\( 2d \\) must be 6 because \\( 2d \\) is always at least as large as \\( d \\), and if \\( d \\) were 6, then \\( 2d \\) would be 12, which is too large.
