We know that he earns 20% less than at his main job, so:\n\nHourly wage at second job = Hourly wage at main job * (1 - 0.2)\n= $20 * 0.8\n= $16\n\nNow, let's find out how many hours James works at his second job:\n\nHours at second job = Hours at main job / 2\n= 30 hours / 2\n= 15 hours\n\nNext, we'll calculate how much James earns per week at each job:\n\nWeekly earnings at main job = Hourly wage at main job * Hours per week\n= $20 * 30 hours\n= $600\n\nWeekly earnings at second job = Hourly wage at second job * Hours per week\n= $16 * 15 hours\n= $240\n\nFinally, we'll find out James' total weekly earnings:\n\nTotal weekly earnings = Weekly earnings at main job + Weekly earnings at second job\n= $600 + $240\n= $840.\n\nSo, James earns a total of $840 per week.\n\nFinal Answer: 840.0",
        "Let's break down the earnings for Lee:\n\n1. For mowing one lawn, Lee earns $33.\n2. Last week, he mowed 16 lawns. So, for mowing those lawns, he earned 16 * $33 = $<<16*33=528>>528.\n3. He also received a $10 tip from each of three customers. So, he earned 3 * $10 = $<<3*10=30>>30 in tips.\n4. To find the total earnings last week, we add the earnings from mowing the lawns and the tips: $528 + $30 = $<<528+30=558>>558.\n\nSo, Lee earned $558 mowing lawns last week.\n\nFinal Answer: 558.0",
        "Let's first find out how many coins Elsa and Amalie have based on their ratio. Let x be the common unit of coins for both Elsa and Amalie.\n\nThe ratio of Elsa's coins to Amalie's coins is 10:45, which can be written as a fraction: Elsa/Amalie = 10/45.\n\nTo find the number of coins each person has, we need to find the value of Elsa's and Amalie's shares based on their ratio and the total number of coins they have (440).\n\nFirst, let's find the sum of the parts of the ratio:\n\n10 (Elsa's part) + 45 (Amalie's part) = 55\n\nNow, we'll find the value of one part of the ratio by dividing the total number of coins by the sum of the parts of the ratio:\n\nValue of one part = Total coins / Sum of parts\nValue of one part = 440 / 55 \u2248 8.00\n\nNow, we can find the number of coins Elsa and Amalie have:\n\nElsa's coins = 10 * Value of one part\nElsa's coins = 10 * 8.00 = 80\n\nAmalie's coins = 45 * Value of one part\nAmalie's coins = 45 * 8.00 = 360\n\nNow, we know that Amalie spends 3/4 of her coins on toys. So, we need to find out how many coins she spends on toys and how many coins she remains with.\n\nCoins spent on toys = Amalie's coins * 3/4\nCoins spent on toys = 360 * 3/4 = 270\n\nNow, we can find out how many coins Amalie remains with:\n\nCoins remaining = Amalie's coins - Coins spent on toys\nCoins remaining = 360 - 270 = 90\n\nSo, Amalie remains with 90 coins.\n\nFinal Answer: 90.0",
