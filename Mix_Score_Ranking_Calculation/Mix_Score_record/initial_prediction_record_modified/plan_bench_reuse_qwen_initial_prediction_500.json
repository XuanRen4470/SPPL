We can unstack it.\n   - After unstacking, the blue block will be clear, and the red block will be on the table.\n\n3. **Pick up the red block.**\n   - Since the red block is on the table and clear, we can pick it up.\n   - Now the hand is holding the red block.\n\n4. **Place the orange block on the table.**\n   - The orange block is on the table, and the blue block is clear. We can place the orange block on the table.\n   - The orange block is now on the table, and it is clear.\n\n5. **Place the yellow block on the table.**\n   - The yellow block is on the table, and the blue block is clear. We can place the yellow block on the table.\n   - The yellow block is now on the table, and it is clear.\n\n6. **Place the blue block on the table.**\n   - The blue block is on the table, and it is clear. We can place the blue block on the table.\n   - The blue block is now on the table, and it is clear.\n\nThe final state will be:\n\n- Blue block is clear.\n- Orange block is clear.\n- Yellow block is clear.\n- Hand is currently holding the red block.\n- Blue block is on the table.\n- Orange block is on the table.\n- Yellow block is on the table.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1.

The yellow block must be clear to stack it on the red block.\n\nSince the second step in the plan is not possible given the initial conditions, the plan cannot achieve the goal as stated. We need to revise the plan to make sure all steps are feasible and achieve the goal.\n\nHere is a revised plan:\n\n1. **Pick up the blue block from the orange block**\n   - This is possible because the blue block is on top of the orange block and the hand is empty.\n   - After this, the hand is holding the blue block, and the orange block is on the table.\n\n2. **Put down the blue block on the table**\n   - This is possible because the hand is holding the blue block and the blue block is clear.\n   - After this, the blue block is on the table, and the hand is empty.\n\n3. **Pick up the yellow block from the blue block**\n   - This is not possible because the blue block is not on top of the yellow block.\n\nSince the third step is not possible, we need to re-evaluate the initial conditions and the goal. The goal cannot be achieved with the given initial conditions and the constraints provided. The yellow block is on top of the blue block, and we cannot pick up the blue block while the yellow block is on top of it. \n\nThus, the goal as stated cannot be achieved with the given initial conditions and the constraints.
