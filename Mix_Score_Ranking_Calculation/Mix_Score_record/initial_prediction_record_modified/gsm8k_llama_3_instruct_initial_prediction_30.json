        "Let's break it down step by step!\n\nNatalia sold 48 clips to her friends in April.\n\nIn May, she sold half as many clips, which means she sold:\n\n48 \u00f7 2 = 24 clips\n\nTo find the total number of clips she sold in April and May, we add the number of clips she sold in each month:\n\n48 (April) + 24 (May) = 72\n\nSo, Natalia sold 72 clips altogether in April and May.",
        "Since Weng earns $12 an hour, we need to convert the 50 minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n\n50 minutes \u00f7 60 = 0.83 hours\n\nNow, we can multiply the number of hours she worked (0.83) by her hourly wage ($12):\n\n0.83 hours \u00d7 $12 = $9.96\n\nSo, Weng earned $9.96 for babysitting yesterday.",
        "Betty has half of the money she needs. That means she has 100 / 2 = 50 dollars. She gets 15 from her parents and 15 * 2 = 30 from her grandparents. So she has 50 + 15 + 30 = 95 dollars. She needs 100 - 95 = 5 dollars more. The answer is 5.",
        "Julie has 120 pages. Yesterday, she read 12 pages. Today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday, so 2 * 12 = 24 pages. So far, she has read 12 + 24 = 36 pages. That leaves 120 - 36 = 84 pages. She wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow. Half of 84 is 42. The answer is 42.",
        "James writes 2 friends each a 3-page letter twice a week. So that is 3 x 2 x 2 = 12 pages per week. There are 52 weeks in a year. So that is 12 x 52 = 624 pages per year. The answer is 624.",
        "Let's start by figuring out how many purple flowers there are. Since there are 10 yellow flowers and 80% more purple flowers, there are 10 * 1.8 = 18 purple flowers. Then, the total number of yellow and purple flowers is 10 + 18 = 28. The number of green flowers is 25% of the number of yellow and purple flowers, so it is 28 * 0.25 = 7. The total number of flowers is 10 + 18 + 7 = 35. The answer is 35.",
        "Albert bought 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas. A large pizza has 16 slices, so 2 large pizzas is 2 x 16 = 32 slices. A small pizza has 8 slices, so 2 small pizzas is 2 x 8 = 16 slices. In total, Albert has 32 + 16 = 48 slices of pizza. The answer is 48.",

        "Alexis started with 200 dollars. She spent 30 on a shirt, 46 on pants, 38 on a coat, 11 on socks, and 18 on a belt. So she spent 30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 = 143 dollars. After spending 143 dollars, she had 200 - 143 = 57 dollars left. But she only has 16 dollars left, so she must have spent 57 - 16 = 41 dollars on the shoes. The answer is 41.",
        "Tina makes $18.00 an hour.  She works 8 hours the first day.  That is 8 x $18.00 = $144.00.  She works 2 more hours the first day.  That is 2 x ($18.00 + $18.00/2) = 2 x ($18.00 + $9.00) = 2 x $27.00 = $54.00.  So she makes $144.00 + $54.00 = $198.00 the first day.\n\nShe works 8 hours the second day.  That is 8 x $18.00 = $144.00.  She works 2 more hours the second day.  That is 2 x ($18.00 + $18.00/2) = 2 x ($18.00 + $9.00) = 2 x $27.00 = $54.00.  So she makes $144.00 + $54.00 = $198.00 the second day.\n\nShe works 8 hours the third day.  That is 8 x $18.00 = $144.00.  She works 2 more hours the third day.  That is 2 x ($18.00 + $18.00/2) = 2 x ($18.00 + $9.00) = 2 x $27.00 = $54.00.  So she makes $144.00 + $54.00 = $198.00 the third day.\n\nShe works 8 hours the fourth day.

So she makes $144.00 + $54.00 = $198.00 the fourth day.\n\nShe works 8 hours the fifth day.  That is 8 x $18.00 = $144.00.  She works 2 more hours the fifth day.  That is 2 x ($18.00 + $18.00/2) = 2 x ($18.00 + $9.00) = 2 x $27.00 = $54.00.  So she makes $144.00 + $54.00 = $198.00 the fifth day.\n\nShe makes $198.00 for each of the 5 days.  So she makes 5 x $198.00 = $990.00.",
        "The monster has eaten 847 people over 3 hundred years. 3 hundred years divided by 100 is 3. So the monster has eaten 3 ships. If each ship has twice as many people as the last ship, then the first ship has half as many people as the last ship. The last ship has half as many people as the second ship. The second ship has half as many people as the first ship. Let x be the number of people on the first ship. Then the number of people on the second ship is 2x, and the number of people on the last ship is 4x. The total number of people is 847, so x + 2x + 4x = 847. This is 7x = 847. x = 847 / 7 = 121. The answer is 121.",
        "Let's start by finding out how much Tobias has in total. He gets a $5 allowance each month for 3 months, so he has 3 x 5 = 15 dollars. He also mows 4 lawns for $15 each, so that is 4 x 15 = 60 dollars. He also has some money left over after buying the shoes, which is 15 dollars. So in total he has 15 + 60 + 15 = 90 dollars.\n\nThe shoes cost 95 dollars, so he is 5 dollars short. He must have made 5 dollars from shoveling driveways. Since he charges 7 dollars for each driveway, he must have shoveled 5 / 7 = 0.71 driveways. Since you can't shovel a fraction of a driveway, he must have shoveled 0 driveways.\n\nThe correct answer is 0 driveways.",
        "Randy has 60 mango trees. He has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees. Half of 60 is 30. 5 less than 30 is 25. So he has 25 coconut trees. In total, he has 60 + 25 = 85 trees. The answer is 85.",
        "Jasper bought 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for 10 dollars. That means 1 pound of cheddar cheese costs 10 / 2 = 5 dollars. The cream cheese costs half the price of the cheddar cheese, so it costs 5 / 2 = 2.5 dollars. The pack of cold cuts costs twice the price of the cheddar cheese, so it costs 2 * 5 = 10 dollars. The total cost is 10 + 2.5 + 10 = 22.5 dollars. The answer is 22.5.",
        "Let's break this down step by step!\n\nJoy can read 8 pages in 20 minutes. To find out how many pages she can read in 1 minute, we can divide 8 pages by 20 minutes:\n\n8 pages \u00f7 20 minutes = 0.4 pages per minute\n\nNow, let's convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so:\n\n20 minutes \u00f7 60 = 0.33 hours\n\nNow, we can use the rate of 0.4 pages per minute to find out how many pages Joy can read in 0.33 hours:\n\n0.4 pages per minute \u00d7 0.33 hours = 0.132 pages per hour\n\nSince Joy reads 0.132 pages per hour, we can multiply this by the total number of pages she needs to read (120 pages) to find the total time it will take her:\n\n120 pages \u00f7 0.132 pages per hour = 909.09 minutes\n\nFinally, we can convert the total time from minutes to hours:\n\n909.09 minutes \u00f7 60 = 15.15 hours\n\nSo, it will take Joy approximately 15 hours and 9 minutes to read 120 pages.",
        "James makes the movie for 2000 dollars.  Each DVD costs 6 dollars to make.  He sells it for 2.5 times that much, which is 6 * 2.5 = 15 dollars.  So he makes 15 - 6 = 9 dollars profit per DVD.  He sells 500 DVDs a day, and 5 days a week.  So he makes 500 * 5 * 9 = 22,500 dollars per week.  After 20 weeks, he will have made 22,500 * 20 = 450,000 dollars.  However, he spent 2000 dollars to make the movie, so his total profit is 450,000 - 2000 = 448,000.",
        "Let's break this down step by step!\n\nSince the profit is shared in the ratio 2:5, we can set up an equation to represent the total amount of profit:\n\n2x + 5x = Total Profit\n\nWhere x is the amount Mike gets.\n\nSince Johnson got $2500, we can set up another equation:\n\n5x = 2500\n\nTo solve for x, we can divide both sides by 5:\n\nx = 2500 / 5\nx = 500\n\nSo Mike gets $500.\n\nNow, Mike spends $200 on a shirt, leaving him with:\n\n$500 - $200 = $300\n\nMike has $300 left after buying the shirt.",
        "There were originally 26 + 15 + 24 = 65 hard hats. Carl took 4 pink hats, leaving 65 - 4 = 61. John took 6 pink hats, and twice as many green hats. So John took 6 + 12 = 18 pink and green hats. So now there are 61 - 18 = 43 hats left. The answer is 43.",
        "Roque walks to and from work three times a week. It takes him 2 hours to walk there and 2 hours to walk back. So it takes him 2 + 2 = 4 hours each time he walks. He walks 3 times a week, so 4 * 3 = 12 hours a week.\n\nRoque rides his bike to and from work twice a week. It takes him 1 hour to ride there and 1 hour to ride back. So it takes him 1 + 1 = 2 hours each time he rides. He rides 2 times a week, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours a week.\n\n12 hours walking + 4 hours biking = 16 hours a week. The answer is 16.",
        "Let's break it down:\n\n* Tim rides to and from work for 5 days, which means he rides a total of 10 miles each day (20 miles x 2 trips). So, for the 5 workdays, he rides a total of 10 x 5 = 50 miles.\n* On the weekend, he goes for a 200-mile ride.\n\nIn total, Tim bikes for 50 miles (workdays) + 200 miles (weekend) = 250 miles.\n\nSince he bikes at 25 mph, we can calculate the total time spent biking as:\n\nTotal time = Total distance / Speed\n= 250 miles / 25 mph\n= 10 hours\n\nSo, Tim spends 10 hours biking in a week.",
        "Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps. She bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so that is 11 + 9 = 20 truck stamps. She bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so that is 20 - 13 = 7 rose stamps. So in total she bought 11 + 20 + 7 = 38 stamps. The answer is 38.",
        "Let's start with the jaguars. Each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day. So, 6 jaguars will eat 6 x 5 = 30 snakes per day.\n\nEach snake eats 3 birds per day. So, 30 snakes will eat 30 x 3 = 90 birds per day.\n\nEach bird eats 12 beetles per day. So, 90 birds will eat 90 x 12 = 1080 beetles per day.\n\nTherefore, a total of 1080 beetles are eaten each day.",
