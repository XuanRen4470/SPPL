        "To achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the orange block, the orange block on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block on the table, you can follow the plan below:\n\n1. Unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block. (1 minute)\n2. Put down the yellow block. (1 minute)\n3. Unstack the blue block from on top of the red block. (1 minute)\n4. Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block. (1 minute)\n5. Pick up the red block. (1 minute)\n6. Stack the red block on top of the orange block. (1 minute)\n\nThe total time to execute the plan is 6 minutes.\n\nExplanation:\nWe start by unstacking the yellow block from on top of the orange block and putting it down. Then, we unstack the blue block from on top of the red block and stack it on top of the yellow block. Next, we pick up the red block and stack it on top of the orange block.
