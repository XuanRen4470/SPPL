After the action sequence, the orange block is on top of the blue block, which means the blue block was unstacked from the yellow block. The blue block was then stacked on top of the orange block.\n\nThe yellow block was on the table initially, and it was picked up and stacked on top of the blue block. The red block was picked up at the end of the action sequence, so it must be clear that it is not on top of any other block.\n\nSo, the resulting state is:\n\n* The red block is clear, the hand is holding the red block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is on the table.\n\nThis is the final resulting state.",
        "I'll solve the problem step by step.\n\nInitial conditions:\n\n* The blue block is clear\n* The orange block is clear\n* The hand is empty\n* The blue block is on top of the yellow block\n* The orange block is on top of the red block\n* The red block is on the table\n* The yellow block is on the table\n\nAction sequence:\n\n* Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block\n\nAfter the action sequence, the state becomes:\n\n* The blue block is still clear\n* The orange block is still clear\n* The hand is holding the blue block\n* The blue block is no longer on top of the yellow block\n* The yellow block is now clear\n* The orange block is still on top of the red block\n* The red block is still on the table\n\nSo, the resulting state is:\n\n* The blue block is clear\n* The orange block is clear\n* The hand is holding the blue block\n* The blue block is on the table\n* The yellow block is clear\n* The orange block is on top of the red block\n* The red block is on the table",
