        "To find the value of $x$ that minimizes the quadratic function $f(x) = x^2 - 10x + 24$, we need to find the vertex of the parabola represented by the function. We can do this by finding the value of $x$ that makes the coefficient of $x^2$ positive and the coefficient of $x$ negative, since the vertex of a parabola of the form $ax^2+bx+c$ is given by the formula:\n\n$$x = \\frac{-b}{2a}$$\n\nIn this case, we have $a = 1$ and $b = -10$. So,\n\n$$x = \\frac{-(-10)}{2(1)} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5$$\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of $x^2- 10x + 24$ is obtained when $x = 5$.

Therefore, the degree of $g(x)$ must be such that:\n\ndegree of $g(x)$ = degree of $h(x)$ - degree of $f(x)$\n\nWe know that degree of $h(x)$ = 6 and degree of $f(x)$ = 2, so:\n\ndegree of $g(x)$ = 6 - 2 = 4\n\nTherefore, the degree of $g(x)$ is 4.
