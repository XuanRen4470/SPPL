We know that there are 10 yellow flowers, and there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow, so there are 18 yellow flowers (10 x 1.8).\n\nWe also know that there are 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers combined. So, the number of green flowers is 0.25 * (10 + 18) = 6.5 * 18 = 117 (rounded up since we can't have a fraction of a flower).\n\nTherefore, the total number of flowers in Mark's garden is:\n\n10 (yellow) + 18 (purple) + 117 (green) = 135 flowers.",

Sugar cookies: Let's assume there was 6.67 kg of butter left after making chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies (since 5 + 2 = 7, but we need a number that can be divided by 3). However, we made a mistake in our calculation for the amount of butter used for peanut butter cookies, it should be 10 kg * 1/6 = 1.67 kg instead. So, the correct calculation for the remaining butter after peanut butter cookies is: 10 kg - 5 kg - 1.67 kg = 3.33 kg.\n\nHowever, since we can't have a fraction of a kilogram left, we need to find out how much more butter Liza needs to buy to make up for the small difference. The difference is: 6.67 kg - 3.33 kg = 3.34 kg.\n\nTherefore, Liza needs to buy an additional 3.34 kg of butter to make all the desired cookies. The final answer is that Liza used 10 kg - 5 kg - 1.67 kg - 3.34 kg = 0.69 kg of butter for making all the cookies.

But this is an error as it cannot gain more weight than the target. We meant to say it gained a fifth of the target weight, so it gained 1000 * (1/5) = 200 pounds from eating berries.\n2. During autumn, it gained twice the amount it gained from berries from acorns. So it gained 200 * 2 = 400 pounds from acorns.\n3. Half of the remaining weight it needed to gain came from salmon. Let's find out how much weight that is: 1000 - 200 - 400 = 400 pounds. So the bear gained 400 pounds from salmon.\n4. Now we need to find out how much weight the bear gained from eating small animals. We know that it gained 200 pounds from berries, 400 pounds from acorns, and 400 pounds from salmon. So the weight it gained from eating small animals is 1000 - 200 - 400 - 400 = 0 pounds.\n\nIt seems there is an inconsistency in the problem statement, as the bear cannot gain a net weight of 0 pounds from its food sources. The problem should be checked for errors.",
        "First, let's find out how much oil is in the 10 cans that we know hold 8 liters each:\n\nOil in 10 cans = Number of cans * Oil per can\n                         = 10 * 8\n                         = 80 liters\n\nNow, we can find out how much oil is in the remaining cans by subtracting the oil in the 10 known cans from the total oil:\n\nTotal oil = Oil in known cans + Oil in unknown cans\n                 = 80 liters + (Number of unknown cans * Oil per unknown can)\n\nWe know that there are 24 cans in total and 10 of them have been identified, so there must be 14 unknown cans. We want to find the oil in each of these unknown cans, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n290 liters = 80 liters + (14 * Oil per unknown can)\n\nTo solve for Oil per unknown can, we can first subtract 80 liters from both sides of the equation:\n\n210 liters = 14 * Oil per unknown can\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 14 to find the oil per unknown can:\n\nOil per unknown can = 210 liters / 14\n                                 = 15 liters\n\nSo, each of the remaining cans is holding 15 liters of oil.",
        "To meet her minimum goal of 30 situps, Shawna would need to do 8 more situps. She has already done 12 on Monday and 19 on Tuesday, so she would need to do 8 situps on Wednesday. Therefore, her total number of situps for the week would be 12 + 19 + 8 = 39 situps. However, since the goal was specifically for 3 workouts, she should aim for 10 situps per day to reach her goal of 30 situps in total across 3 days. To make up for the missing situps, she could do an extra 10 situps each day for the rest of the week, or spread the extra situps out over the next few workouts. So, the answer depends on her preference and schedule. If she wants to complete her goal in the next day or two, she could do an extra 8 situps on Wednesday, for a total of 20 situps that day. Alternatively, she could do 2 extra situps each day for the next 4 days to reach her goal.",
        "First, let's find out how much James earns per hour at his second job. We know that he earns 20% less than at his main job, so:\n\nHourly wage at second job = Hourly wage at main job * (1 - 0.2)\n= $20 * 0.8\n= $16\n\nNow, let's find out how many hours James works at his second job:\n\nHours at second job = Hours at main job / 2\n= 30 hours / 2\n= 15 hours\n\nNext, we'll calculate how much James earns per week at each job:\n\nWeekly earnings at main job = Hourly wage at main job * Hours per week\n= $20 * 30 hours\n= $600\n\nWeekly earnings at second job = Hourly wage at second job * Hours per week\n= $16 * 15 hours\n= $240\n\nFinally, we'll find out James' total weekly earnings:\n\nTotal weekly earnings = Weekly earnings at main job + Weekly earnings at second job\n= $600 + $240\n= $840.\n\nSo, James earns a total of $840 per week.",

He also received a $10 tip from each of three customers. So, he earned 3 * $10 = $<<3*10=30>>30 in tips.\n4. To find the total earnings last week, we add the earnings from mowing the lawns and the tips: $528 + $30 = $<<528+30=558>>558.\n\nSo, Lee earned $558 mowing lawns last week.",
        "First, let's calculate the total amount Tara needs to pay for the laptop, including the down payment. The laptop costs $1000, and she wants to pay an additional $20 for the down payment. So the total amount is:\n\n$1000 (laptop cost) + $20 (down payment) = $1020\n\nNext, let's calculate how much she pays per month, including the down payment. She makes a down payment of 20% of the total cost, which is $204 (20% of $1020), and then pays $65 per month for 4 months.\n\nThe total amount she pays over 4 months is:\n\n$204 (down payment) + $65/month * 4 months = $204 + $260 = $464\n\nTo find her balance after paying for 4 months, subtract the amount she has paid from the total cost:\n\n$1020 (total cost) - $464 (amount paid) = $556\n\nSo her balance after paying for 4 months is $556.",

Let x be the common unit of coins for both Elsa and Amalie.\n\nThe ratio of Elsa's coins to Amalie's coins is 10:45, which can be written as a fraction: Elsa/Amalie = 10/45.\n\nTo find the number of coins each person has, we need to find the value of Elsa's and Amalie's shares based on their ratio and the total number of coins they have (440).\n\nFirst, let's find the sum of the parts of the ratio:\n\n10 (Elsa's part) + 45 (Amalie's part) = 55\n\nNow, we'll find the value of one part of the ratio by dividing the total number of coins by the sum of the parts of the ratio:\n\nValue of one part = Total coins / Sum of parts\nValue of one part = 440 / 55 \u2248 8.00\n\nNow, we can find the number of coins Elsa and Amalie have:\n\nElsa's coins = 10 * Value of one part\nElsa's coins = 10 * 8.00 = 80\n\nAmalie's coins = 45 * Value of one part\nAmalie's coins = 45 * 8.00 = 360\n\nNow, we know that Amalie spends 3/4 of her coins on toys. So, we need to find out how many coins she spends on toys and how many coins she remains with.\n\nCoins spent on toys = Amalie's coins * 3/4\nCoins spent on toys = 360 * 3/4 = 270\n\nNow, we can find out how many coins Amalie remains with:\n\nCoins remaining = Amalie's coins - Coins spent on toys\nCoins remaining = 360 - 270 = 90\n\nSo, Amalie remains with 90 coins.",

Half of the water is in the aquarium when it's filled halfway, so we need to find the total volume first and then find half of that.\n4. Total volume: 4 ft * 6 ft * 3 ft = 144 cubic feet\n5. Half of the water: 144 cubic ft * 0.5 = 72 cubic feet\n6. Nancy spills half of the water, so now there's only 72 cubic feet of water in the aquarium.\n7. Then she triples the amount of water in the aquarium, which means she adds 108 cubic feet more.\n8.

The second person lost 7 kilograms less than the first person, so the second person lost 27 kilograms - 7 kilograms = 20 kilograms.\n4. The weight lost by the last two people is equal.\n\nTo find out how much the last two people lost, we first need to find out how much weight the first two people lost in total:\n\n1. The first two people lost 27 kilograms (by the first person) + 20 kilograms (by the second person) = 47 kilograms.\n2. Since the last two people lost the same amount, and the total weight lost by all four people is 103 kilograms, we can find the weight lost by each of the last two people by subtracting the weight lost by the first two people from the total weight lost: 103 kilograms - 47 kilograms = 56 kilograms.\n\nSo, each of the last two people lost 56 kilograms.",

In the third round, Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam, who completed 16 skips. So Jeff completed 20 skips in the third round.\n4. In the last round, Jeff completed half the number of skips as Sam. So Jeff completed 8 skips in the last round.\n\nNow let's find the average number of skips Jeff completed per round:\n\nThe total number of skips Jeff completed in all rounds is 15 + 13 + 20 + 8 = 56 skips.\n\nThe total number of rounds is 4.\n\nSo the average number of skips Jeff completed per round is 56 / 4 = 14 skips per round.\n\nHowever, this answer is not correct based on the given information. Jeff only completed half the number of skips as Sam in the last round, but the problem states that Sam skipped 16 times in each round. This means that Jeff's skips in the last round should also be a multiple of 16. Let's adjust the calculations accordingly.\n\nLet x be the number of skips Sam completed in the last round. Then Jeff completed half that number, or x/2 skips. Since Sam completed 16 skips in each of the first three rounds, the total number of skips they completed in the competition is 16*4 + x.\n\nThe difference in the number of skips between Sam and Jeff in each round is constant, so we can set up the equation: 16 - 3 = Sam's skips in the first round > Jeff's skips in the first round, and 16 + 3 = Sam's skips in the second round < Jeff's skips in the second round. Therefore, the difference between their skips in each round is 3.\n\nNow we have the system of equations:\n16 +3 = 2*x\n16 - 3 = x\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get x = 19. This means that Sam completed 19 skips in the last round, and Jeff completed 9.5 skips in the last round, which is not possible.

        "To find out how many cups of food Herman will need in total for all three months, we first need to calculate how many cups he uses in one day, and then multiply that by the number of days in each month, and finally sum up the results for all three months.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many cups Herman uses in one day:\n\nCups per day = Cups per feeding * 2 feedings\n                     = 1/2 cup * 2\n                     = 1 cup\n\nNow, let's calculate how many cups he uses in one month. We need to know the number of days in each month, which we can assume are 31 for December, January, and February for simplicity:\n\nCups per month = Cups per day * Days per month\n                         = 1 cup * 31\n                         = 31 cups\n\nFinally, we can find out how many cups Herman will need in total for all three months by summing up the cups per month for each month:\n\nTotal cups = Cups per month (December) + Cups per month (January) + Cups per month (February)\n                 = 31 cups + 31 cups + 31 cups\n                 = 93 cups\n\nSo, Herman will need 93 cups of food for all three months.",

We know that he writes 20 pages a day, so:\n\nDays to write one book = Total pages for one book / Pages written per day\n\nDays to write one book = 400 pages / 20 pages per day\nDays to write one book = 20 days\n\nNow that we know it takes John 20 days to write one book, we can find out how long it takes him to write three books:\n\nTotal days to write three books = Number of books * Days to write one book\n\nTotal days to write three books = 3 books * 20 days per book\nTotal days to write three books = 60 days\n\nSo, it will take John 60 days to write three books, each with 400 pages.",
        "Let's first find out how many nickels Alice received in exchange for her 20 quarters. One quarter is worth 25 cents, so Alice had 20 quarters * 25 cents = $5. Therefore, she should have received 5 dollars worth of nickels.\n\nHowever, we know that 20% of those nickels are worth $3 each. So we need to find out how many of those nickels there are:\n\n$3 is the value of one iron nickel, and 20% of the total nickels are iron nickels, so:\n\nnumber of iron nickels = total number of nickels * 0.2\n\nWe know that the total number of nickels is 5 dollars worth, so:\n\ntotal number of nickels = $5 / 5 cents per nickel = 100 nickels\n\nnumber of iron nickels = 100 nickels * 0.2 = <<100*0.2=20>>20 nickels\n\nSo Alice now has 88 regular nickels (100 total nickels - 20 iron nickels) and their value is:\n\nvalue of regular nickels = number of regular nickels * value per nickel\n                                       = 88 nickels * 5 cents per nickel\n                                       = $0.44\n\nFinally, the total value of Alice's money is the sum of the value of her regular nickels and the value of her iron nickels:\n\ntotal value = value of regular nickels + value of iron nickels\n                 = $0.44 + $3 * number of iron nickels\n                 = $0.44 + $3 * 20\n                 = $0.44 + $60\n                 = $<<0.44+60=60.44>>60.44\n\nHowever, since Alice cannot have a fraction of a dollar, we can assume that she rounded down the value of her regular nickels to $0.40, and rounded up the total value to $61. So the final answer is:\n\ntotal value = $<<0.40+60=60.40>>60.40 (approximately)\n\nBut in reality, Alice should go back to the bank and exchange her iron nickels for quarters or paper money.",

He gave twice as many as he gave to Todd to Alisha, so he gave x - 4 + 2(x - 4) = x - 4 + 2x - 8 = 3x - 12 gumballs to Alisha.\n3. He gave 5 less than four times as many to Bobby as he gave to Alisha, so he gave 4x - 5 gumballs to Bobby.\n4. Hector had 6 gumballs left, so x - 4 + 3x - 12 + 4x - 5 = x + 6.\n5. Solving the equation x +6 = 4x +1 we can find x = -3 or x = 3/2. Since the number of gumballs cannot be negative or a fraction, x = 3/2 is not a valid solution.\n6. Therefore, x = 6 is the solution.

        "To determine how many more fish Gail has in the first tank than the second tank, we first need to find out how many inches of water are in each tank and then convert that to the number of fish for each tank.\n\nThe first tank is twice the size of the second tank, so let's call the number of gallons in the second tank x. Then, the first tank has 2x gallons of water. We know that the first tank has 48 gallons of water, so we can set up the equation:\n\n2x = 48\nx = 24\n\nSo, the second tank has 24 gallons of water.\n\nNow, we can find out how many inches of water are in each tank and then convert that to the number of fish for each tank using the given rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish.\n\nFor the second tank:\nNumber of inches = Gallons of water / Gallons per inch\nNumber of inches = 24 / 1\nNumber of inches = 24\n\nSince Gail keeps two-inch fish in the second tank, the number of fish in the second tank is equal to the number of inches of water:\n\nNumber of fish (second tank) = 24\n\nFor the first tank:\nNumber of inches = Gallons of water / Gallons per inch\nNumber of inches = 2x / 1\nNumber of inches = 2 * 24\nNumber of inches = 48\n\nSince Gail keeps three-inch fish in the first tank, the number of fish in the first tank is less than the number of inches of water due to each fish taking up more space. We can calculate the number of fish in the first tank by dividing the total inches of water by the inches per fish and then subtracting one fish due to one fish eating another:\n\nNumber of inches per fish = 3\nNumber of fish = Total inches of water / Inches per fish - 1\nNumber of fish = 48 / 3 - 1\nNumber of fish = 15.33 (approximately)\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a fish, we'll round down to the nearest whole number:\n\nNumber of fish (first tank) = 15\n\nSo, Gail has 15 more fish in the first tank than the second tank.",

Keely and Kendall each ate twice as many as Alyssa.\n\nLet's represent the number of chicken nuggets Alyssa ate as \"x\". According to the problem, Keely and Kendall each ate twice as many as Alyssa, so they each ate 2x.\n\nThe total number of chicken nuggets they all ate is 100. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\nx (for Alyssa) + 2x (for Keely) + 2x (for Kendall) = 100\n\nNow, we can simplify this equation by combining the terms with \"x\":\n\n3x = 100\n\nTo find the value of \"x\", we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\nx = 100 / 3\nx \u2248 33.33\n\nSince Alyssa can't eat a fraction of a chicken nugget, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Alyssa ate approximately 33 chicken nuggets.\n\nHowever, since Keely and Kendall each ate twice as many as Alyssa, the actual number of chicken nuggets they ate is more than what our calculation suggests. To maintain the total order of 100 chicken nuggets, we need to adjust the number of chicken nuggets Alyssa ate.\n\nLet's assume Alyssa ate 32 chicken nuggets instead of 33. Then, Keely and Kendall each ate 2 * 32 = 64 chicken nuggets. The total number of chicken nuggets they all ate is now:\n\n32 (for Alyssa) + 64 (for Keely) + 64 (for Kendall) = 152\n\nSince they only ordered 100 chicken nuggets, this means that there is a discrepancy in our calculation. It's possible that our initial assumption that Keely and Kendall each ate exactly twice as many as Alyssa was incorrect, and they may have eaten slightly fewer or more chicken nuggets to account for the difference.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given information, it's not possible to determine the exact number of chicken nuggets Alyssa ate while maintaining the total order of 100 chicken nuggets. Our initial calculation suggests that Alyssa ate around 33 chicken nuggets, but this would result in an excess of 52 chicken nuggets being consumed. Adjusting Alyssa's portion to 32 chicken nuggets brings the total down to 152 chicken nuggets, which is still more than the ordered amount.

The total number of photos they took during the two-day trip is X + X/2.\n\nThe problem states that they took half as many photos on the second day as they did on the first day, so X/2 = 0.5 * X. Solving for X, we get X = 2 * X/2 = 2 * 0.5 * X = X. So, X = 2X/2 = 2 * 2 = 4 times the number of photos they took on the second day.\n\nTherefore, they took 4 * (X/2) = 4 * (0.5 * X) = 2 * 0.5 * X * 4 = 2 * 0.5 * X * 2 = X * 2 photos on the first day.\n\nWe know that they have 400 photos in the family gallery and they added X + X/2 = 2X/2 = X * 2 photos to it.

        "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Let x be the number of clownfish and blowfish in each tank. Since there is an equal number of each type of fish in each tank, x represents the number of both clownfish and blowfish in each tank.\n2. We know that there are 26 blowfish in their own tank, so the number of clownfish in their tank is also x.\n3. The total number of fish in the aquarium is 100, so 2x represents the total number of fish in both tanks.\n4. We know that x + 26 is the total number of blowfish in the aquarium, and x is the number of clownfish in the clownfish tank.\n5. When the remaining blowfish and an equal number of clownfish join the display tank, the number of fish in that tank is 2x + x = 3x.\n6. We also know that a third of these clownfish swim back into their own tank, so the number of clownfish in the display tank is 3x - (x/3).\n7. Since the total number of fish in the display tank is given as 100 - 26 - x (the number of clownfish and blowfish in their own tanks), we can set up the equation: 100 - 26 - x = 3x - (x/3).\n8. Solving for x, we get x = 22.\n9. Therefore, there are 22 clownfish in the display tank.",

We also know that the third ball is three times as large as the first ball, so its size is 3x/2.\n\nWe're given that Joy used 27 feet of yarn for the third ball. We can find the amount of yarn used for the first ball by dividing its size by 3 (since it's one third the size of the third ball):\n\nSize of first ball = x/2\nAmount of yarn for first ball = Size of first ball * 3\n                                            = (x/2) * 3\n\nSince the first ball uses one half the amount of yarn as the second ball, we can find the amount of yarn for the second ball by multiplying the amount of yarn for the first ball by 2:\n\nAmount of yarn for second ball = Amount of yarn for first ball * 2\n                                             = ((x/2) * 3) * 2\n                                             = (3x/2) * 2\n                                             = 3x\n\nNow we have the amount of yarn for the second ball in terms of x. We need to find the value of x such that the amount of yarn used for the second ball is also 27 feet. We can set up an equation and solve for x:\n\n3x = 27\nx = 9\n\nSo the second ball is 9 feet in size. To find the amount of yarn used for the second ball, we can use the relationship between the size and the amount of yarn:\n\nAmount of yarn for second ball = 3x = 3 * 9 = 27 feet.\n\nTherefore, Joy used 27 feet of yarn for the second ball as well. However, this answer seems inconsistent with the information given about the sizes of the balls. It's possible that there's an error in the problem statement or that Joy used the same length of yarn for all three balls, which is not specified in the problem.",

Find out how many inches she has grown until now: Growth = 3 inches/year * Number of years\n2. Set up the equation and solve for the number of years: 20 inches = 3 inches/year * Number of years\n\nSolving for the number of years:\nNumber of years = 20 inches / 3 inches/year\nNumber of years = 6.67 years (approximately)\n\nSince Haley cannot be 0.67 years old, we need to round up to the next full year. So, she is currently in her 7th year.\n\nNow, let's calculate her height after 10 years:\n\nHeight after 10 years = Current height + (Growth per year * Number of years)\nHeight after 10 years = 20 inches + (3 inches/year * 10 years)\nHeight after 10 years = 20 inches + (30 inches)\nHeight after 10 years = 50 inches\n\nSo, Haley will be 50 inches tall after 10 years.",

The total time James spent watching TV is the sum of the time spent on each show: 0.67 hours (Jeopardy) + 1.33 hours (Wheel of Fortune) = 2 hours.\n\nSo, James watched TV for a total of 2 hours.",
        "Let's first find out how long it takes Cory and Blake to clean their rooms. We know that:\n\n1. Richard takes 22 minutes to clean his room.\n2. Cory takes 3 minutes more than Richard.\n3. Blake takes 4 minutes less than Cory.\n\nLet's find the time it takes for Cory to clean her room:\n\nCory's cleaning time = Richard's cleaning time + 3 minutes\nCory's cleaning time = 22 minutes + 3 minutes\nCory's cleaning time = 25 minutes\n\nNow, let's find the time it takes for Blake to clean his room:\n\nBlake's cleaning time = Cory's cleaning time - 4 minutes\nBlake's cleaning time = 25 minutes - 4 minutes\nBlake's cleaning time = 21 minutes\n\nSince they all have to clean their rooms twice a week, we can calculate the total time they spend cleaning their rooms each week:\n\nTotal time for Richard = 22 minutes * 2 (cleaning sessions) = 44 minutes\nTotal time for Cory = 25 minutes * 2 = 50 minutes\nTotal time for Blake = 21 minutes * 2 = 42 minutes\n\nSo, all three spend a combined total of 44 + 50 + 42 = 136 minutes cleaning their rooms each week.",

We also know that she delivers a total of 27 meals and packages combined, so x + y = 27.\n\nWe can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Here, we'll use substitution. We'll first find the value of y in terms of x, and then find the value of x.\n\nFrom the equation y = 8x, we have:\n\ny = 8x\n\nNow, we'll substitute y = 8x into the equation x + y = 27:\n\nx + 8x = 27\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n9x = 27\n\nDividing both sides by 9, we find the value of x:\n\nx = 3\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the value of y by substituting x back into the equation y = 8x:\n\ny = 8(3) = 24\n\nSo, Angela delivers 3 meals and 24 packages. However, the problem states that she delivers 8 times as many packages as meals, which would imply that she delivers 27 meals and 216 packages (8 * 27). This contradicts the given information that she delivers a total of 27 meals and packages combined. Therefore, there seems to be an inconsistency in the problem.",

We're given that Daniella has $400 in her son's savings account.\n\nNext, we know that Ariella has $200 more than Daniella, so we can find Ariella's account balance by adding $200 to Daniella's balance:\n\nAriella's balance = Daniella's balance + $200\nAriella's balance = $400 + $200\nAriella's balance = $600\n\nSince Ariella's account earns simple interest at the rate of 10% per annum, we can calculate the amount of interest earned after two years by using the formula:\n\nInterest = Principal * Rate * Time\n\nHowever, we don't have the principal amount (initial balance) for Ariella's account. To find the principal amount, we can set up an equation using the information given:\n\nAriella's balance = Daniella's balance + $200\n$600 = $400 + $200Principal (Ariella) = $600 - $400 = $200\n\nNow that we have the principal amount, we can calculate the interest earned after two years:\n\nInterest = Principal * Rate * Time\nInterest = $200 * 0.1 * 2\nInterest = $400\n\nSo, Ariella will have $1,000 ($600 initial balance + $400 interest) in her son's savings account after two years.",

So, the weekend price would be 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 times the normal price.\n\nWe know that $18 is the price Mario paid on Monday (a weekday), so the normal price would be $18 / 1.5 = $12.67 (approximately).\n\nTo find the price he would have paid the day before (on Sunday), we need to calculate the weekend price: $12.67 * 1.5 = $18.965 (approximately). However, since the price must be a whole number, we can assume that the difference between the weekday and weekend prices is rounded up to the nearest dollar. In this case, we can assume that the weekend price is $19.\n\nTherefore, if Mario paid $18 for his haircut on Monday, he would have paid $1 less for the same haircut on Sunday.

We can denote the monthly payment as P. Since Gary is paying off the loan in 2 years instead of 5, the total number of monthly payments is reduced from 60 (5 years * 12 months) to 24 (2 years * 12 months).\n\nWe can use the formula for calculating loan payments:\n\nMonthly Payment = P = [I * r] / [1 - (1 + r)^-n]\n\nwhere:\n- I = Loan amount\n- r = Monthly interest rate\n- n = Number of monthly payments\n\nSince Gary's dad lent him the money, there is no interest involved in this scenario. So, we can simplify the formula to:\n\nMonthly Payment = P = I / n\n\nNow, we can calculate the monthly payment if Gary had paid the loan back over 5 years:\n\nMonthly Payment (5 years) = P (5-years) = $6,000 / (5 * 12) = $100\n\nSince Gary is now paying off the loan in 2 years, the total number of monthly payments is 24. We can calculate the monthly payment for this scenario:\n\nMonthly Payment (2 years) = P (2-years) = $6,000 / (2 * 12) = $208.33 (approximately)\n\nNow, we can find the difference in monthly payments:\n\nDifference in Monthly Payments = $208.33 - $100 = $108.33 (approximately)\n\nSo, Gary is spending an additional $108.33 per month to pay off the loan in 2 years instead of 5.",

Next year, he'll have 16 cars + 50% of 16 = 16 + (0.5 * 16) = 16 + 8 = 24 cars.\n3. The year after that, he'll have 24 cars + 50% of 24 = 24 + (0.5 * 24) = 24 + 12 = 36 cars.\n\nSo, Bobby will have 36 toy cars in three years.",
        "To calculate the difference in expenses between last year and this year for Jessica, we need to find the new monthly costs for rent, food, and car insurance, and then compare that to her expenses last year.\n\nLast year's monthly expenses:\nRent: $1000\nFood: $200\nCar insurance: $100\n\nTotal monthly expenses last year: $1200\n\nNow let's calculate the new monthly expenses for this year:\n\nNew rent: $1000 + 30% of $1000 = $1300\nNew food: $200 + 50% of $200 = $300\nNew car insurance: $100 * 3 = $300\n\nTotal monthly expenses this year: $1600\n\nThe difference in expenses between last year and this year is:\n\n$1600 (this year) - $1200 (last year) = $400\n\nTherefore, Jessica pays an additional $400 in expenses per month this year compared to last year. To find her total additional expenses over the whole year, we can multiply this monthly difference by 12 months:\n\n$400 (monthly difference) * 12 (months) = $4800\n\nSo Jessica pays an extra $4800 in expenses over the whole year compared to last year.",
        "To calculate how many hours Randy needs to practice each day to become a piano expert by the age of 20, we first need to find out how many hours of practice he would have had by that age if he practiced every day, Monday through Friday, for the entire period.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many weeks there are between turning 12 and 20.\n\n1. Subtract the number of weeks in Randy's age at the start (12) from the number of weeks in his age at the end (20): 20 - 12 = 8 years\n2. Multiply the number of years by the number of weeks in a year (52): 8 * 52 = 416 weeks\n\nNow, let's calculate how many hours of practice Randy needs in total to become an expert:\n\n1. The 10,000-hour rule states that it takes 10,000 hours of deliberate practice to become an expert.\n2. So, Randy needs to practice for a total of 10,000 hours.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many hours of practice Randy needs to have each day:\n\n1. Divide the total number of hours required by the number of weeks in the time period: 10,000 hours / 416 weeks = 24.1 hours per week\n2. Since Randy cannot practice for more than 24 hours in a week, we need to find out how many hours he can practice each day while staying below this weekly limit.\n3. Divide the weekly hours by the number of days he practices each week (5): 24.1 hours per week / 5 days = 4.82 hours per day\n\nHowever, since Randy cannot practice for a fraction of an hour, he would need to round up to the nearest whole hour, meaning he would need to practice for at least 5 hours per day to meet the 10,000-hour requirement before turning 20.\n\nIt's important to note that the 10,000-hour rule is a rough guideline and doesn't account for individual differences, such as natural ability, the quality of practice, or other factors. Additionally, taking two weeks off for vacation each year would mean practicing for fewer than 5 hours per day on those weeks, so the actual total hours practiced might be slightly less than 10,000 hours.",

Since 8 beakers have copper ions and a total of 45 drops were used, the average number of drops per beaker with copper ions is:\n\nAverage drops for beakers with copper ions = Total drops / Number of beakers with copper ions\nAverage drops for beakers with copper ions = 45 drops / 8 beakers\nAverage drops for beakers with copper ions = 5.625 drops\n\nSince only whole drops can be added, we will assume that 6 drops are needed on average to identify a beaker with copper ions.\n\nNow, let's find out how many beakers without copper ions were tested. Since 14 beakers were not identified as having copper ions yet (since 8 were identified), and 6 drops were used for each beaker with copper ions, the number of drops used for beakers without copper ions is:\n\nTotal drops for beakers without copper ions = Total drops - Drops for beakers with copper ions\nTotal drops for beakers without copper ions = 45 drops - (8 beakers * 6 drops)\nTotal drops for beakers without copper ions = 45 drops - 48 drops\nTotal drops for beakers without copper ions = -3 drops\n\nThis result is not possible, as we cannot have a negative number of drops.

We know that 1 hour equals 60 minutes, so:\n\n1 hour = 60 minutes\n\nNext, we need to find out how many minutes a week Ayla spends on the phone with her customers. Since she talks to 50 customers a week, and each call lasts 1 hour, the total number of minutes she spends on the phone in a week is:\n\n50 customers * 60 minutes/customer = 3000 minutes/week\n\nNow, we need to find out how much the phone bill is for these minutes. We know that each minute costs five cents, so:\n\nPhone bill = 3000 minutes * $0.05/minute = $150/week\n\nFinally, we need to find out how much the phone bill is at the end of the month if Ayla manages to talk to 50 customers a week every week in a month, which has 4 weeks. So, the total phone bill at the end of the month would be:\n\n$150/week * 4 weeks = $600/month.",

Since the commercial is currently 30 seconds long, we can calculate how long it will be after the desired changes by finding 30% of 30 and then subtracting that amount.\n\nFirst, let's find 30% of 30:\n\n30% of 30 = (30 * 0.3) = 9. So, Ursula needs to remove 9 seconds from the commercial.\n\nNow, let's find out how long the commercial will be after making the changes:\n\n30 seconds (current length) - 9 seconds (to be removed) = 21 seconds\n\nSo, the commercial will be 21 seconds long after Ursula makes the desired changes.",
        "Let's first find out how many marbles Katrina has. Since Amanda has x marbles and needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many as Katrina, we can write this equation: x = 2K, where K is the number of marbles Katrina has.\n\nSubstituting the given information about Amanda having 12 fewer marbles than twice the number of marbles Katrina has, we get: x = 2K, x = 2(K+12). Solving this system of equations, we find that K = 6.\n\nNow that we know Katrina has 6 marbles, we can find out how many marbles Amanda and Mabel have. Amanda has 12 fewer marbles than twice the number of marbles Katrina has, so Amanda has x = 2 * 6 - 12 = 6 * 2 - 12 = 10 marbles.\n\nMabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina, so Mabel has x = 5 * 6 = 30 marbles.\n\nTo find out how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda, we subtract the number of marbles Amanda has from the number of marbles Mabel has: 30 - 10 = 20 marbles.\n\nSo, Mabel has 20 more marbles than Amanda.",

        "To find out how much money the winner will receive, we first need to determine how much Lily spends on each ticket and how much she makes from selling each ticket.\n\nSince she sells the first ticket for $1 and keeps a $4 profit, she spends $1 on the first ticket and makes $4 profit. So, the cost for the second ticket must be $1 + $1 = $2, and she makes $4 + $1 = $5 profit on it.\n\nWe can find the cost and profit for each ticket using this pattern:\n\nTicket Cost Profit\n1 $1 $4\n2 $2 $5\n3 $3 $6\n4 $4 $7\n5 Seller keeps the difference\n\nTo find the cost of the fifth ticket, we can use the formula:\n\nCost of fifth ticket = Cost of fourth ticket + $1\nCost of fifth ticket = $4 + $1 = $5\n\nSince Lily keeps the difference between the cost and her profit, the profit for the fifth ticket is:\n\nProfit of fifth ticket = Selling price - Cost of fifth ticket\nProfit of fifth ticket = $ (selling price) - $5\n\nNow, we know that Lily wants to give the remaining money as the prize. Since she keeps a $4 profit, the total amount of money she makes from selling all five tickets is:\n\nTotal profit = Profit of first ticket + Profit of second ticket + Profit of third ticket + Profit of fourth ticket + Profit of fifth ticket\nTotal profit = $4 + $5 + $6 + $7 + (selling price - $5)\n\nSince we want to find the selling price for the fifth ticket that results in a specific prize amount, let's set up an equation:\n\nTotal profit = Prize amount\n$4 + $5+ $6+ $7+ (selling price - $5) = Prize amount\n\nTo solve for the selling price, we can first simplify the equation:\n\n$12 + (selling price - $5) = Prize amount\n\nNow, we can subtract $12 from both sides of the equation to find the selling price:\n\nselling price - $5 = Prize amount - $12\nselling price = Prize amount - $12 + $5\n\nSo, the winner of the lottery will receive a prize amount that is $7 less than the selling price of the fifth ticket. For example, if Lily sells the fifth ticket for $20, the winner will receive a prize of $13 ($20 - $7).",

So, Jack took S/2 candies.\n2. Then, Paul took 4 candies more than half of the candies, which means he took (S/2 + 4) candies.\n3. The total number of candies Paul took is the number of candies Jack left, which is (S - Jack's candies). So, Paul took (S - S/2 - 4) candies.\n4. Since the number of candies Paul took is equal to the total number of candies minus the number of candies Jack took, we can write the equation: S = (S - S/2 - 4) + (S/2).\n5. Solving for S, we get: S = 2S/2 + 4.\n6. Simplifying the equation, we have: S = 2S + 8.\n7. Solving for S, we get: S = -8.

So, she buys a total of 3 chocolates every Saturday.\n\nSince we don't have the exact number of Saturdays in a month, let's assume there are 4 weeks in a month, which makes 4 Saturdays. So, Kantana buys 3 chocolates each Saturday for 4 weeks, which equals 12 chocolates per month for herself and her sister.\n\nAdditionally, she bought 10 chocolates as a birthday gift for Charlie.\n\nSo, Kantana ended up buying 12 chocolates for herself and her sister, plus 10 chocolates as a gift, making a total of 22 chocolates for the month.",
        "To find out how much it costs Martha to make 1 quart of each ice cream, we first need to calculate how many cups of each type of berries and how many cups of heavy cream she needs for each quart.\n\nFor 1 quart of strawberry ice cream, she needs:\n- 4 cups strawberries\n- 2 cups heavy cream\n\nFor 1 quart of raspberry ice cream, she needs:\n- 4 cups raspberries\n- 2 cups heavy cream\n\nLet's calculate the cost of the strawberry ice cream first.\n\nThe cost of strawberries for 1 quart:\n- She needs 4 cups of strawberries, so she needs to buy 2 packages of 2 cups each.\n- Each package costs $3.00, so the total cost for strawberries is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00\n\nThe cost of heavy cream for 1 quart:\n- She needs 2 cups of heavy cream, which is half of a 4 cup container.\n- Each 4 cup container costs $4.00, so the cost for the amount of heavy cream she needs is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00\n\nSo, the total cost for making 1 quart of strawberry ice cream is $6.00 + $2.00 = $8.00\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of raspberry ice cream.\n\nThe cost of raspberries for 1 quart:\n- She needs 4 cups of raspberries, so she needs to buy 2 packages of 2 cups each.\n- Each package costs $5.00, so the total cost for raspberries is 2 * $5.00 = $10.00\n\nThe cost of heavy cream for 1 quart:\n- She already calculated that the cost for 2 cups of heavy cream is $2.00\n\nSo, the total cost for making 1 quart of raspberry ice cream is $10.00 + $2.00 = $12.00\n\nTherefore, it will cost Martha a total of $20.00 to make 1 quart of each ice cream.",
        "First, let's calculate the cost of each item before the sale:\n\n1. Hand mitts (3 pieces): $14.00 each * 3 = $42.00\n2. Apron: $16.00\n3. Set of 3 cooking utensils: $10.00\n4. Small knife: $10.00 * 2 = $20.00\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost before the sale:\n\nTotal cost before sale = $42.00 (mitts) + $16.00 (apron) + $10.00 (utensils) + $20.00 (knife) = $88.00\n\nNext, we need to apply the 25% discount:\n\nDiscount = 0.25 * $88.00 = $22.00\n\nSubtract the discount from the total cost before the sale to find the final cost:\n\nFinal cost = $88.00 - $22.00 = $66.00\n\nSo, Eve will spend $66.00 on the cooking gear gifts for her nieces.",

        "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:\n\n1. After sweeping, 9/10 of the dust particles were removed, so the number of remaining dust particles before sweeping was 10/9 of the initial amount.\n2. Let's call the initial number of dust particles x. After sweeping, there were 331 - 9/10 * x particles.\n3. When Samuel walked across the porch, 223 new dust particles were generated. So, the total number of dust particles after he walked was 331 + 223 = 554.\n4. We can set up an equation to represent the situation: x = 10/9 * (x + 223)\n5. Solving for x, we can use the quadratic formula: x = (9 * (223) + 10 * (x)) / (19)\n6. Since x represents the initial number of dust particles, it must be a positive number. We can use trial and error to find a value that makes the right side of the equation a positive number.\n7. For example, if we try x = 1000, the right side of the equation is 1011.11, which is not a positive number. We can keep increasing the value of x until we find a positive number.\n8. When x = 3000, the right side of the equation is 3210.11, which is a positive number.\n9. Since x is the initial number of dust particles, and we know that 9/10 of that amount was removed, the initial number of dust particles was approximately 3333.33 (rounded to the nearest whole number, 3334).\n\nSo, before Samuel swept, there were approximately 3334 dust particles on the porch.",

        "To find out how many kilometers the ship was blown in a westward direction by the storm, we first need to determine how far the Skipper had traveled east before the storm.\n\nWe know that the Skipper traveled at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour for 20 hours. So, the distance he covered before turning off the engines is:\n\nDistance before storm = Speed * Time\n                                 = 30 km/h * 20 hours\n                                 = 600 kilometers\n\nSince the Skipper was only one-third of the way to his destination after the storm, we can calculate the total distance to the destination by finding out how far he would have traveled if he had continued at the same speed for the entire journey.\n\nLet's call the total distance to the destination \"d\" kilometers. Then, we know that:\n\nOne-third of the total distance = 600 kilometers\n\nTo find the total distance, we can set up the following equation:\n\nd = 3 * 600\nd = 1800 kilometers\n\nNow, since the Skipper had traveled 600 kilometers before the storm, and the storm blew him back by an amount that left him one-third of the way to his destination, the distance blown by the storm is:\n\nDistance blown by storm = Total distance - Distance before storm\n                                       = 1800 kilometers - 600 kilometers\n                                       = 1200 kilometers\n\nSo, the ship was blown in a westward direction by the storm for a distance of 1200 kilometers.",
        "Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step:\n\n1. Karen's tote bag weighs 8 pounds when it's empty.\n2. When Karen's tote is full, it weighs the same as an empty briefcase.\n3. An empty briefcase weighs less than Karen's tote (half the weight).\n4. When Kevin's briefcase is full, it weighs twice as much as Karen's tote.\n5. The contents of Kevin's full briefcase can be divided into two parts: his laptop and his work papers.\n6. The weight of Kevin's work papers is a sixth of the weight of the full briefcase.\n\nLet x be the weight of Kevin's laptop. The weight of Kevin's work papers is x/6.\n\nAccording to the problem, an empty briefcase weighs half as much as Karen's tote, so the weight of a full briefcase (Kevin's laptop and work papers) is twice the weight of Karen's tote.\n\nWe can set up the equation: 8 (Karen's tote) + x (Kevin's laptop) + (x/6) (Kevin's work papers) = 2 * 8 (twice Karen's tote)\n\nSimplifying the equation: 8 + x + (x/6) = 16\n\nTo solve for x, we first need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 6:\n\n6 * (8 + x + (x/6)) = 6 * 16\n\nNow, we can distribute the 6 on the left side:\n\n48 + 6x + x = 96\n\nNext, we combine like terms:\n\n7x = 48\n\nFinally, we divide both sides by 7 to find the weight of Kevin's laptop:\n\nx = 48 / 7 \u2248 6.86 pounds\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a pound, we can round up to the nearest whole number:\n\nx = 7 pounds\n\nNow, to find the difference in weight between Karen's tote and Kevin's laptop:\n\n7 (Kevin's laptop) - 8 (Karen's tote) = 1 pound\n\nSo, Kevin's laptop weighs 1 pound more than Karen's tote.",
        "Let's first find out how much Tony and Arnold paid for the apples and bananas separately.\n\nFor Tony:\nPrice for 2 dozen apples = $7\nPrice for 1 bunch of bananas = Unknown\n\nWe know that 1 dozen = 12, so 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24. Therefore, the price for 24 apples is $7. To find the price for one dozen apples, we divide the price by the number of apples in one dozen: Price for 1 dozen apples = $7 / 24 = $0.2917 (approximately). Since the price for 1 bunch of bananas is not given, we cannot find its exact cost based on the given information about Tony's purchase.\n\nFor Arnold:\nPrice for 1 dozen apples = $5\nPrice for 1 bunch of bananas = $5 (since the price for apples and bananas is given as a single amount)\n\nSo, we know that Arnold paid $5 for both 1 dozen apples and 1 bunch of bananas. To find the cost for just the bunch of bananas, we subtract the price for the apples: $5 (total) - $0.2917 (price for 1 dozen apples) = $4.7083 (approximately).\n\nTherefore, a bunch of bananas costs approximately $4.71 (rounded up).",

Keaton climbed 30 feet ladder twenty times, so the total length he climbed is:\n\n30 ft * 20 = 600 ft\n\nReece climbed a ladder 4 feet shorter than Keaton's ladder, so his ladder is 26 feet long (30 ft - 4 ft). He climbed this ladder 15 times, so the total length he climbed is:\n\n26 ft * 15 = 390 ft\n\nNow, to find the total length they both climbed in inches, we need to convert their total feet climbed to inches and then add them up:\n\n1 foot = 12 inches\n\nTotal length Keaton climbed = 600 ft * 12 in/ft = 7200 in\nTotal length Reece climbed = 390 ft * 12 in/ft = 4680 in\n\nTotal length they both climbed = 7200 in + 4680 in = 11,880 in",

        "To find the average time per kilometer, we first need to find the total distance ran by TJ and the total time taken. Since the race was a 10K (10,000 meters), we can calculate the time taken for each half and then find the average time per kilometer.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time taken for each half:\n1. The first half was run in 20 minutes.\n2. The second half was run in 30 minutes.\n\nNow, let's convert the time taken in minutes to hours and minutes:\n1. 20 minutes = 0.3333 hours (20 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes)\n2. 30 minutes = 0.5 hours (30 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes)\n\nSo, the total time taken by TJ to complete the 10K race was:\nTotal time = 0.3333 hours (first half) + 0.5 hours (second half) = 0.8333 hours\n\nTo find the average time per kilometer, we can use the following formula:\nAverage time per kilometer = Total distance \u00f7 Total time\n\nAverage time per kilometer = 10,000 meters \u00f7 0.8333 hours \u2248 12,038.6 meters/hour\n\nTo convert the average time per hour to average time per kilometer, we divide the total distance by the total time:\n\nAverage time per kilometer = 10,000 meters \u00f7 0.8333 hours \u2248 12,038.6 meters/hour\n\nTo get the average time per kilometer, we need to convert this value to meters per kilometer:\n\nAverage time per kilometer = 12,038.6 meters/hour \u00f7 1,000 meters/kilometer \u2248 12.04 minutes/kilometer\n\nSo, TJ's average time per kilometer was approximately 12.04 minutes.",

We also know that Caleb picked 5 apples less than Kayla, so Kayla picked 5 apples more than Caleb.\n3. Therefore, the difference in the number of apples picked between Suraya and Kayla is the sum of the differences between Suraya and Caleb, and between Caleb and Kayla: Suraya - Kayla = (Suraya - Caleb) + (Caleb - Kayla)\n4. We know that Suraya picked 12 apples more than Caleb, and Caleb picked 5 apples less than Kayla (who picked 20 apples), so we can substitute these values into the equation: Suraya - Kayla = (Suraya - Caleb) + (Caleb - 20)\n5. To find the values of Suraya and Caleb, we can use the fact that the difference between Suraya and Caleb is 12, and the difference between Caleb and Kayla is 5: Suraya = Caleb + 12, and Caleb = Kayla - 5\n6. Substituting these expressions into the equation, we get: Suraya - Kayla = (Suraya - Caleb) + (Caleb - 20) = ((Caleb + 12) - Kayla) + (Kayla - 5)\n7.

So, the difference in the number of elephants represents the net change during this time period.\n\nNet change = Final number of elephants - Initial number of elephants\n          = 28,980 - 30,000\n          = -1,020\n\nSince the net change is negative, it means that there was a decrease in the number of elephants, which is not what we are looking for. We need to find the rate at which new elephants entered during the 7-hour period.\n\nLet x be the number of new elephants that entered per hour. The total number of elephants in the park during the 11-hour period (4 hours of exodus and 7 hours of new entry) can be represented by the equation:\n\n30,000 - (2,880 * 4) + (x * 7) = 28,980\n\nSolving for x:\n\n30,000 - 11,520 + 7x = 28,980\n12,480 + 7x = 28,980\n7x = 16,492\nx \u2248 2,356 elephants/hour\n\nSo, the new elephants entered the park at a rate of approximately 2,356 elephants/hour.",

Arlette is 3/4 times as old as Kimiko, so Arlette's age is 3/4 * 28 = 21.29 years old (However, since we cannot have a fractional age, we'll assume Arlette is 21 years old and round up or down for other calculations if necessary).\n\nNow let's calculate the average age of the three:\n\nAverage age = (Total age of the three) / (Number of people)\n\nTotal age of the three = 28 (Kimiko) + 56 (Omi) + 21 (Arlette) = 105\n\nNumber of people = 3\n\nSo, the average age of the three is 105 / 3 = 35.\n\nTherefore, the average age of Omi, Kimiko, and Arlette is 35 years old.",
        "To find out how many bales of hay the farmer will have left by the end of December, we first need to calculate how many bales he produces from the new 7-acre plot and how many bales are consumed by the horses.\n\nFirst, let's determine how many bales the farmer produces from 7 acres:\n1. Last year, he produced 560 bales from 5 acres.\n2. So, the yield per acre is 560 bales / 5 acres = 112 bales/acre.\n3. This year, he has 7 acres, so he produces 112 bales/acre * 7 acres = 784 bales.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many bales are consumed by the horses:\n1. Each horse consumes 3 bales/day.\n2. There are 9 horses, so they consume 3 bales/horse/day * 9 horses = 27 bales/day.\n3. There are 30 days in a month (on average), so they consume 27 bales/day * 30 days = 810 bales/month.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many bales will be left by the end of December:\n1. From September to December, there are 4 months with 30 days each, so there are 4 * 30 = 120 days.\n2. During this period, the horses consume 810 bales/month * 4 months = 3240 bales.\n3. The farmer produces 784 bales/month from the new plot, so he has a total of 784 bales/month + 560 bales/month (from the old plot) = 1344 bales/month.\n4. To find out how many bales will be left by the end of December, we subtract the bales consumed by the horses from the bales produced: 1344 bales/month * 12 months - 3240 bales = 11,520 bales - 3240 bales = 8280 bales.\n\nSo, the farmer would have 8280 bales of hay left by the end of December.",

However, if we want to include the riverbank in the calculation, we would need to subtract the width of the riverbank from the river width before making the calculation, resulting in 7 boats being able to race.\n\nTherefore, at most, 8 boats can race in a river that is 42 feet across with a minimum 2-foot distance between them, but only 7 boats can race if we include the riverbank in the calculation.",
        "Let's break down the time spent on cooking and watching the movies:\n\n1. Cooking: They spent 10 minutes making popcorn and twice as long making fries. So, the time spent on cooking is: 10 minutes (popcorn) + 2 * 10 minutes (fries) = 20 minutes.\n2. Movies: The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long, which is equal to 1 hour and 180 minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). The second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first, so it is 1 hour and 180 minutes + 30 minutes = 1 hour and 210 minutes (or 2 hours and 1 minute).\n\nTo find the total time spent on cooking and watching the movies, add the time spent on cooking and the time spent on watching the movies: 20 minutes (cooking) + (1 hour and 180 minutes + 2 hours and 1 minute) = 3 hours and 181 minutes.\n\nSince we want the answer in hours, we can convert minutes to hours by dividing the number of minutes by 60: 3 hours and 181 minutes = 3 hours + (181 minutes / 60 minutes) = 3 hours + 3 hours and 1 minute (approximately).\n\nSo, the final answer is approximately 6 hours and 1 minute.",
        "Let's denote Milford's current age as X. We know that Eustace is X + (X/2) because he is X years older than Milford and X/2 is the difference in their ages. In three years, Eustace will be 39, so we can set up the equation:\n\nX + (X/2) = 39 (in three years)\n\nTo solve for X, we first need to get rid of the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n2X + X = 78\n\nNext, we can combine like terms:\n\n3X = 78\n\nNow, we can solve for X by dividing both sides by 3:\n\nX = 26\n\nSo, Milford is currently 26 years old. In three years, he will be 26 + 3 = 29 years old.\n\nHowever, there seems to be a mistake in the problem statement as Eustace's age in three years (39) is not consistent with the given information that Eustace is twice as old as Milford. According to the provided information, Milford should be 13.5 years old (half of Eustace's age), and in three years, Eustace would be 39 and Milford would be 13.5 + 3 = 16.5.

We can convert grams to milligrams (mg) since caffeine is typically measured in mg. There are 1000 mg in 1 g, so 250 g is equal to 250,000 mg. Since the drink is 12 ounces, we can find the caffeine per ounce by dividing the total caffeine by the volume: 250,000 mg / 12 oz * 29.57 L/gal * 1,000,000 mg/L = 20,711 mg/oz.\n\n2. The second energy drink is 2 oz (59 mL) and is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce than the first drink. So, it contains 2 oz * 20,711 mg/oz = 41,422 mg.\n\n3. The total caffeine from the two energy drinks is 250,000 mg + 41,422 mg = 291,422 mg.\n\n4.

To find out how much that is, we can calculate: 10 kg * (9/10) = 9 kg\n3. After cooking in the morning, she had 1 kg of rice left.\n4. In the evening, she cooked 1/4 of the remaining rice. To find out how much that is, we can calculate: 1 kg * (1/4) = 0.25 kg\n5. To find out how much rice was left after cooking in the evening, we subtract the weight of the rice cooked in the evening from the weight of the rice left after cooking in the morning: 1 kg - 0.25 kg = 0.75 kg\n6. Since we need to find the answer in grams, we can convert the remaining weight to grams: 0.75 kg * 1000 g/kg = 750 g\n\nSo, Rose had 750 grams of rice left.",

        "Let's find out how many pieces of fruit Tanya originally had and then determine how many plums she bought based on the number of pieces that remained in the bag.\n\n1. Tanya bought 6 pears, 4 Granny Smith apples, 2 pineapples, and an unknown number of plums.\n2. The total number of pieces of fruit that fell out of the bag is half of the initial amount, so we need to find the total number of pieces of fruit first.\n3. Each pear and each apple is one piece of fruit, so Tanya bought 6 pears + 4 apples = 10 pieces of pears and apples.\n4. Each pineapple consists of several sections, but for simplicity, let's assume that a pineapple is also one piece of fruit (even though it's technically not true). So, Tanya bought 2 pineapples, which is also 2 pieces of fruit.\n5. In total, Tanya bought 10 pieces of pears and apples + 2 pieces of pineapples = 12 pieces of fruit.\n6. Half of the fruit fell out of the bag, so 12 pieces of fruit became 12 \u00f7 2 = 6 pieces of fruit.\n7. However, we know that there were 9 pieces of fruit left in the bag. This means that 1 piece of fruit didn't fall out of the bag.\n8. Since plums were in a small basket, they might not have fallen out as easily as other fruits when the bag tore. So, it's possible that one of the plums remained in the bag.\n9. Therefore, Tanya bought 1 plum less than the number of pieces of fruit that remained in the bag after the incident.\n10. So, Tanya bought 9 pieces of fruit - 1 = 8 pieces of fruit + 1 plum = 9 plums.\n\nTherefore, Tanya bought 9 plums.",

        "To find out how many books Tina sold, we first need to determine her total cost and then subtract it from her total revenue.\n\nLet's denote the number of books sold as x. Since each customer buys 2 books at a time, the number of customers is equal to the number of books sold divided by 2.\n\nWe know that Tina makes a profit of $120 on her sales. Her revenue comes from selling each book for $20. So, her total revenue is:\n\nTotal revenue = x * $20 (per book)\n\nHer total cost is the cost to make each book ($5) multiplied by the number of books she sold (x). Therefore, her total cost is:\n\nTotal cost = x * ($5 per book)\n\nTo find her profit, we subtract her total cost from her total revenue:\n\nProfit = Total revenue - Total cost\nProfit = x * $20 - x * $5\n\nWe want to find the value of x that makes her profit equal to $120. So, we set up the equation:\n\nx * $20 - x * $5 = $120\n\nNow, we can solve for x by factoring out x:\n\nx * ($20 - $5) = $120\nx * $15 = $120\n\nNext, we divide both sides by $15 to find the value of x:\n\nx = $120 / $15\nx = 8\n\nSince each customer buys 2 books at a time, the number of customers is equal to the number of books sold divided by 2. So, the number of customers is:\n\nNumber of customers = x / 2\nNumber of customers = 8 / 2\nNumber of customers = 4\n\nTherefore, Tina has sold books to 4 customers, and each customer has bought 2 books. So, she has sold a total of 8 books.",

Let x be the number of pens Catherine had initially.\n\nx = 60 (pens she had) + 8 (pens she gave away per friend) * 7 (number of friends)\nx = 60 + 56\nx = 116\n\nNow, we know that Catherine had an equal number of pencils as pens, so she had 116 pencils initially.\n\nTherefore, Catherine had 116 pens and 116 pencils initially, and after giving some to her friends, she had:\n\nPens left = 60 (initial number of pens) - 8 (pens given per friend) * 7 (number of friends) = 60 - 56 = 4\n\nPencils left = 116 (initial number of pencils) - 6 (pencils given per friend) * 7 (number of friends) = 116 - 42 = 74\n\nSo, Catherine had 4 pens and 74 pencils left.",

Since each chicken needs 2 pounds of feed, we can calculate the number of chickens sold based on the amount of feed used.\n\nWe know that the cost of a bag of feed is $2 and it weighs 20 pounds. To find the cost per pound of feed, we can divide the cost by the weight:\n\nCost per pound = Cost of a bag / Weight of a bag\nCost per pound = $2 / 20 pounds\nCost per pound = $0.10\n\nNow that we know the cost per pound of feed, we can calculate the profit per chicken by subtracting the cost of the feed from the selling price:\n\nProfit per chicken = Selling price - Cost of feed\nProfit per chicken = $1.50 - ($0.10 * 2)\nProfit per chicken = $1.50 - $0.20\nProfit per chicken = $1.30\n\nSince Lao made a profit of $65 from selling chickens, we can calculate the number of chickens sold by dividing the total profit by the profit per chicken:\n\nNumber of chickens = Total profit / Profit per chicken\nNumber of chickens = $65 / $1.30\nNumber of chickens \u2248 49.23\n\nSince we cannot sell a fraction of a chicken, Lao sold approximately 49 chickens.",

The total cost for t-shirts and bags is $16 + $20 = $<<16+20=36>>36.\n\nTimothy has $50 to spend, but he already spent $36 on t-shirts and bags. He has $50 - $36 = $<<50-36=14>>14 left.\n\nKey chains sell 3 pieces for $2, so the cost for 1 piece is $2 / 3 = $<<2/3=0.67>>0.67.

Let's represent Cori's age in 5 years as X.\n4. In 5 years, her age will be one-third of her aunt's age, so we can write the equation: X = (1/3) * Aunt's Age\n5. We know that in 5 years, Cori will be 8 years old, so we can set up the equation: 8 = (1/3) * Aunt's Age\n6. To find the value of the aunt's age, we can cross-multiply and solve for Aunt's Age: 8 * 3 = 1 * Aunt's Age\n7. Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: 24 = Aunt's Age\n\nTherefore, Cori's aunt is currently 24 years old.",

Percentage difference = (Difference / Building height) * 100% = (28 ft / 200 ft) * 100% = 14%\n\nCrane 2: Difference = 120 ft (crane height) - 100 ft (building height) = 20 ft. Percentage difference = (Difference / Building height) * 100% = (20 ft / 100 ft) * 100% = 20%\n\nCrane 3: Difference = 147 ft (crane height) - 140 ft (building height) = 7 ft. Percentage difference = (Difference / Building height) * 100% = (7 ft / 140 ft) * 100% = 5%\n\nNow, let's find the average percentage difference:\n\nAverage percentage difference = (Percentage difference for Crane 1 + Percentage difference for Crane 2 + Percentage difference for Crane 3) / Number of cranes\n\nAverage percentage difference = (14% + 20%+ 5%) / 3 = 11.67% (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSo, on average, the cranes are about 11.67% taller than the buildings they are constructing.",

We know that half the number of spiders is x/2, so the total number of spiders is x + x/2 = 2x/2 + x/2 = 3x/2.\n5. Setting up the equation, we have 8 * (3x/2) = 8x + 10.\n6. Solving for x, we get x = (10 + 8 * (3/8) * x) / 8, which simplifies to x = 20/3 \u2248 6.67. Since we cannot have a fractional number of spiders, we need to round up or down. Rounding down would result in fewer legs than in the group, so we round up and get x = 8 spiders.\n7. With 8 spiders, the total number of legs is 8 * 8 = 64 legs.\n\nHowever, we made an error in our initial assumption about the number of spiders in the group being \"half as many\" as the number of spiders in the single spider group. In reality, the number of spiders in the group is 3x/2 = 12 spiders.\n\nSo, the actual total number of spider legs in this group of spiders is 8 * 12 = 96 legs.",

Let x be the number of marbles Emily received from Megan. Then, Emily now has 6 + x marbles.\n3. Emily gives Megan back half of her new total plus 1 marble. So, Megan receives x/2 + 1 marble from Emily.\n\nWe know that the total number of marbles Emily and Megan have after this exchange is the initial number Emily had plus the number she received, and then the number Megan gave back:\n\nInitial marbles (Emily) + Marbles received (Emily) + Marbles given (Emily) + Marbles received (Megan) = Total marbles\n6 + x + x/2 - 1 = Total marbles\n\nTo find the value of Total marbles, we need to find a common denominator for x and 2, which is 2:\n\n6 + x + x/2 - 1 = Total marbles\n6 + x + (x/2) - 1 = Total marbles\n6 + (x+x/2 - 1) = Total marbles\n6 + (x+x/2) = Total marbles\n6 + (x*(1+1/2)) = Total marbles\n6 + (x*(3/2)) = Total marbles\n\nSince we don't have a specific value for the number of marbles Megan gave Emily, we cannot determine the exact number of marbles Emily has now. However, we have found the relationship between the initial number of marbles Emily had, the number of marbles she received, and the total number of marbles after the exchange.",

        "To find the current number of people on the dance team, we need to determine the net change in the number of team members.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many people left the team: 8 people quit.\n\nNext, let's find out how many new people joined the team: 13 new people got in.\n\nNow, we can calculate the net change in the number of team members:\n\nNet change = People who quit - People who joined\nNet change = 8 - 13\nNet change = -5\n\nSince the net change is negative, it means that the current number of team members is less than the initial total of 25. To find the current number of team members, we need to subtract the net change from the initial total:\n\nCurrent number of team members = Initial total - Net change\nCurrent number of team members = 25 - 5\nCurrent number of team members = 20\n\nSo, there are currently 20 people on the dance team.",
        "First, let's calculate how many hours Lance works each day:\n\nHours worked per day = Total hours worked per week / Number of workdays per week\n\nHours worked per day = 35 hours / 5 workdays\n\nHours worked per day = 7 hours\n\nNow, let's calculate how much Lance earns per day:\n\nDaily earnings = Hours worked per day * Hourly wage\n\nDaily earnings = 7 hours * $9/hour\n\nDaily earnings = $63\n\nSo, Lance makes $63 per day while working as a merchandiser during the holidays.",
        "To find the daily average rainfall for the week, we first need to find the total rainfall for each day and then find the total rainfall for the entire week. Here's the calculation:\n\n1. Monday: 2 inches in the morning + 1 inch in the evening = 3 inches\n2. Tuesday: It rained twice as much as Monday, so 3 inches * 2 = 6 inches\n3. Wednesday: No rain\n4. Thursday: 1 inch\n5. Friday: The total rainfall on Friday was equal to the total rainfall from Monday to Thursday, so we need to find that amount first:\n   - Monday to Thursday: 3 inches (Monday) + 6 inches (Tuesday) + 0 inches (Wednesday) + 1 inch (Thursday) = 10 inches\n   - Friday: 10 inches (Monday-Thursday total)\n\nNow that we know the total rainfall for each day, we can find the daily average:\n\nTotal rainfall for the week = 3 inches (Monday) + 6 inches (Tuesday) + 0 inches (Wednesday) + 1 inch (Thursday) + 10 inches (Friday) = 10 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 10 = 24 inches\n\nDaily average rainfall = Total rainfall for the week / Number of days in the week\n\nNumber of days in the week = 7\n\nDaily average rainfall = 24 inches / 7 days = 3.43 inches (approximately)\n\nSo, the daily average rainfall for the week was approximately 3.43 inches.",
        "Let's break down the costs and revenues for Jonah step by step:\n\n1. Jonah bought 6 pineapples for $3 each, so the total cost was 6 * $3 = $18.\n2. Each pineapple could be cut into 12 pineapple rings, so Jonah had a total of 6 * 12 = 72 pineapple rings.\n3. He sold 4 pineapple rings for $5 each, so the total revenue from selling these rings was 4 * $5 = $20.\n4. To find the profit, we need to subtract the cost from the revenue: $20 (revenue) - $18 (cost) = $2.\n\nTherefore, Jonah made a profit of $2 from selling the 4 pineapple rings.",
        "Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. Mrs. Smith initially wanted to spend $500 on clothes.\n2. She picked out items she liked and realized she needed $500 + 2/5 * $500 = $600.\n3. The shop owner gave her a discount of 15% on the total amount, which is $600 * 0.15 = $90.\n4. To find out how much more money she needs after the discount, subtract the discounted amount from the original amount she needed: $600 - $90 = $510.\n\nTherefore, Mrs. Smith will still need $10 more than her initial budget of $500 to buy all the items she wants with the given discount. The final answer is $510.",
