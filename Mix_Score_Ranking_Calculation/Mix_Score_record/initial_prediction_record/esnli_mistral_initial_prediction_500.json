The context describes a woman balancing on the edge of a fountain while dipping her toe in, which is consistent with the statement \"A woman stands on a fountain and dips her toes in.\" However, the context provides additional details that are not explicitly stated in the statement, so the truth of the statement is not definitively determined or irrelevant to the context.\n\nFinal Answer: Neutral.",
        "Inference: The statement \"A woman sits on the grassy ground\" is neutral given the context. The woman in the context is balancing on the edge of a fountain and sticking her toe in the water, which is not described as being on the grassy ground.

        "The statement \"An old woman stands on a fountain and sticks her toes in\" is neutral given the context. The context describes a woman balancing on the edge of a fountain while sticking her toe in the water.
