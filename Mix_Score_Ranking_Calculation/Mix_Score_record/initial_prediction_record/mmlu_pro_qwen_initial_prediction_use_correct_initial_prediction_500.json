        "To determine which option is correct, let's analyze each one in the context of how asteroids are detected in sky surveys.\n\n(A) \"They reflect enough of the sun's light to make them brighter than most background stars\" - Asteroids do reflect sunlight, but they are generally much dimmer than stars. This is a contributing factor but not the primary reason they stand out.\n\n(B) \"Asteroids rotate at a high speed, making them stand out\" - While asteroids do rotate, their rotation speed is not a primary factor in their detection. It's more about their motion over time.\n\n(C) \"Asteroids are larger than most celestial bodies, hence easier to spot\" - This is not accurate. Asteroids are relatively small and would be challenging to spot compared to larger celestial bodies like planets.\n\n(D) \"Asteroids have substantial motion relative to the background stars\" - This is the correct answer. Asteroids move relative to the background stars, which is a key factor in their detection. This motion can be tracked over time, making them stand out in sky surveys.\n\n(E) \"Asteroids have a distinct color that makes them stand out\" - While asteroids can have distinct colors, this is not a primary reason they are detected.\n\n(F) \"Asteroids emit a lot of their own radiation\" - Asteroids do not emit significant radiation that would make them stand out.\n\n(G) \"They emit a high amount of heat, making them detectable\" - Asteroids do not emit a high amount of heat that would make them detectable.\n\n(H) \"They emit a unique sound frequency that can be detected\" - Asteroids do not emit sound frequencies.\n\n(I) \"Asteroids emit pulsed radiation\" - Asteroids do not emit pulsed radiation.\n\nFinal Answer: D",

        "### Inference:\n\n1. **Conservation of Linear Momentum**: \n   - In a frictionless environment and for an isolated system (no external forces), linear momentum is always conserved. The net force on the system is zero, so the total linear momentum before the collision must equal the total linear momentum after the collision.\n   - The collision itself does not change this fact, as internal forces during the collision (like the forces between the skaters) do not affect the total momentum of the system.\n\n2. **Conservation of Kinetic Energy**:\n   - The collision is inelastic because the skaters stick together after the collision. In an inelastic collision, kinetic energy is not conserved; some of it is converted into other forms of energy, such as heat and sound.\n   - An elastic collision, on the other hand, would conserve kinetic energy, but since the skaters stick together, this is not the case here.\n\n3. **Net Force During the Collision**:\n   - Even though the net force on the system (the two skaters) is zero, the forces between the skaters during the collision are internal and do not affect the conservation of linear momentum. The net force on the system remains zero, so linear momentum is conserved.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Linear momentum is conserved because the net force on the system is zero.\n- Kinetic energy is not conserved because the collision is inelastic.\n\n### Final Answer:\n(B)",

The force due to gravity is \\(mg\\), and since \\(g\\) is the same for both, the force is the same, but the key is the ratio of force to mass.\n\n(D): \"gravitational constant is the same for both rocks.\" - The gravitational constant is a universal constant and is the same for all objects, but it doesn't directly explain the acceleration.\n\n(E): \"force due to gravity is zero in free fall.\" - This is incorrect. The force due to gravity is not zero in free fall.\n\n(F): \"ratio of force to mass is the same.\" - This is correct. The acceleration \\(a = \\frac{F}{m} = \\frac{mg}{m} = g\\) is the same for both rocks because the ratio of the force due to gravity to the mass is the same for both.\n\n(G): \"inertia of both rocks is the same.\" - The inertia of the rocks is related to their mass, but it doesn't directly explain why the acceleration is the same.\n\n(H): \"weight of both rocks is the same.\" - The weight of the rocks is \\(mg\\), and since the weight is not the same for a heavy and a light rock, this is incorrect.\n\n(I): \"density of both rocks is the same.\" - The density of the rocks is not relevant to their acceleration in free fall.\n\n(J): \"mass of both rocks is the same.\" - The mass of the rocks is not the same, so this is incorrect.\n\nThe correct option is (F).\n\nFinal Answer: (F)",
        "To solve this, let's consider the process of alpha decay. An alpha particle is equivalent to a helium-4 nucleus, which consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. When a nucleus of uranium-238 emits an alpha particle, it loses 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n\nUranium-238 has 92 protons. After emitting an alpha particle, the new nucleus will have 90 protons (92 - 2) and 236 - 4 = 234 nucleons (238 - 4).\n\nThe element with 90 protons is Thorium (Th), and the mass number is 234. Therefore, the resulting nucleus is Thorium-234.\n\nFinal Answer: (H)",
        "Let's infer first. The red glow in a neon tube of an advertising sign is a result of the electrons in the neon gas being excited to higher energy levels by an electric current.

        "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between specific heat capacity and the cooling rate of materials.\n\n1. **Specific Heat Capacity**: This is the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of a unit mass of a substance by one degree Celsius. Materials with a higher specific heat capacity require more energy to change their temperature, meaning they cool down more slowly.\n\n2. **Cooling Rate**: The rate at which an object cools depends on its specific heat capacity. Materials with a lower specific heat capacity will cool down faster than those with a higher specific heat capacity, given the same conditions.\n\nGiven that hot sand cools off faster at night than does vegetation, we can infer that sand has a lower specific heat capacity compared to vegetation. This is because sand cools down more quickly, which indicates it requires less energy to change its temperature, implying a lower specific heat capacity.\n\n**Final Answer: C**",
        "Coulomb's Law states that the force between two charged particles is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Mathematically, it is expressed as:\n\n\\[ F = k \\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( F \\) is the force between the charges, \\( q_1 \\) and \\( q_2 \\) are the magnitudes of the charges, \\( r \\) is the distance between the charges, and \\( k \\) is Coulomb's constant.\n\nIf the distance \\( r \\) is halved, the new distance is \\( \\frac{r}{2} \\). Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ F' = k \\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{\\left(\\frac{r}{2}\\right)^2} = k \\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{\\frac{r^2}{4}} = 4 \\left( k \\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2} \\right) = 4F \\]\n\nThis means the force becomes four times as strong when the distance between the charged particles is halved.\n\nSince the question states that the particles are placed twice as close to each other, this means the distance is halved. Therefore, the force will be four times as strong.\n\nFinal Answer: (A)",
        "To solve this problem, let's first understand the concept of charging by friction, which is what happens when you brush your hair. When you brush your hair, electrons are transferred from your hair to the brush. This transfer of electrons results in your hair becoming positively charged because it has lost electrons, and the brush becomes negatively charged because it has gained electrons.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n(A) \"The charge depends on the type of brush used\" - This is not correct because the type of brush does not affect the overall charge transfer; it only affects how the charge is distributed.\n\n(B) \"The charge varies depending on the type of hair\" - This is also not correct because the type of hair does not change the fact that electrons are transferred, only the amount or the efficiency might vary slightly.\n\n(C) \"Neutral\" - This is incorrect because the hair has lost electrons, so it cannot be neutral.\n\n(D) \"Neither of these\" - This is incorrect because we know the correct answer is either positive or negative.\n\n(E) \"Negative\" - This is incorrect because the hair loses electrons, so it becomes positively charged, not negatively charged.\n\n(F) \"Positive\" - This is correct because the hair loses electrons, resulting in a positive charge.\n\n(G) \"The charge becomes zero\" - This is incorrect because the hair is not neutralized by the brushing; it gains a positive charge.\n\n(H) \"The charge is alternately positive and negative\" - This is incorrect because the hair consistently loses electrons, resulting in a positive charge.\n\n(I) \"Both of these\" - This is incorrect because the hair cannot be both positively and negatively charged simultaneously.\n\n(J) \"The charge can't be determined by brushing\" - This is incorrect because the charge can be determined based on the transfer of electrons.\n\nFinal Answer: (F)",

        "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the properties of rotational motion for a solid disk.\n\n1. **Period of Rotation**: The period of rotation is the time it takes for one complete revolution. For a solid disk rotating about a fixed axis, the period is the same for all points on the disk. This is because all points on the disk are moving with the same angular velocity and thus complete one revolution in the same amount of time. Therefore, options (C) and (D) are incorrect.\n\n2. **Angular Velocity**: The angular velocity (\\(\\omega\\)) is the rate of change of the angular displacement and is the same for all points on the disk. However, the linear velocity (\\(v\\)) at different points on the disk varies because it depends on the distance from the axis of rotation. The linear velocity is given by \\(v = r\\omega\\), where \\(r\\) is the distance from the axis. Therefore, the part further from the axis has a higher linear velocity, and the part closer to the axis has a lower linear velocity. This rules out options (G) and (I).\n\n3. **Period and Distance from Axis**: Since the period is the same for all points on the disk, the part further from the axis does not have a shorter or longer period compared to the part closer to the axis.

Therefore, we need:\n\n\\[\nD_{\\text{crown}} \\cdot A_{\\text{crown}} = D_{\\text{flint}} \\cdot A_{\\text{flint}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n0.018 \\cdot 15 = 0.049 \\cdot A_f\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(A_f\\):\n\n\\[\nA_f = \\frac{0.018 \\cdot 15}{0.049} = \\frac{0.27}{0.049} \\approx 5.51\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the apex angle of the flint prism is approximately 5.5 degrees.\n\nFinal Answer: (C)",

There are 12 inches in a foot, so:\n\n\\[ 25 \\text{ feet} = 25 \\times 12 = 300 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nNow, we use the magnification formula to find the focal length of the eyepiece:\n\n\\[ 300 = \\frac{300 \\text{ inches}}{\\text{focal length of the eyepiece}} \\]\n\nLet's denote the focal length of the eyepiece as \\( f_e \\):\n\n\\[ 300 = \\frac{300}{f_e} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( f_e \\):\n\n\\[ f_e = \\frac{300}{300} = 1 \\text{ inch} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct focal length of the eyepiece is 1 inch.\n\nFinal Answer: (H)",
        "To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of light when it interacts with a plane mirror in contact with a converging lens and compare it to the behavior of light when it interacts with a concave spherical mirror.\n\n1. **Converging Lens**: A converging lens (convex lens) has a focal length \\( f \\). When light rays parallel to the principal axis pass through a converging lens, they converge at the focal point \\( f \\) on the other side of the lens.\n\n2. **Plane Mirror**: A plane mirror reflects light rays such that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. If a ray is parallel to the principal axis and hits the plane mirror, it will reflect back parallel to the principal axis.\n\n3. **Combining the Two**: When a plane mirror is placed in contact with a converging lens, the light rays that pass through the lens and then reflect off the plane mirror will behave as if they came from a concave mirror with a specific radius of curvature.\n\n4. **Radius of Curvature**: The key is to determine the effective radius of curvature of the mirror. When a plane mirror is in contact with a converging lens, the light rays that pass through the lens and then reflect off the plane mirror behave as if they were coming from a concave mirror with a radius of curvature equal to the focal length \\( f \\) of the lens.\n\nThe radius of curvature \\( R \\) of a concave mirror is related to its focal length \\( f \\) by the equation \\( R = 2f \\). However, in this specific case, the effective radius of curvature is \\( f \\), not \\( 2f \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n**Final Answer: I**",

        "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) The core is the only part of the planet that can withstand the high pressure needed to contain metals.\n- This statement is not entirely accurate. While the core does experience high pressure, it is not the only part of the planet that can contain metals. Metals can exist in the mantle as well, though in different forms.\n\n(B) Metals were drawn to the core by the planet's magnetic field.\n- The magnetic field is not strong enough to draw metals to the core. The magnetic field is a result of the motion of metallic fluids in the core, not the cause of their movement.\n\n(C) Metals sank to the center during a time when the interiors were molten throughout.\n- This is a plausible explanation. When the planet was still molten, denser materials (like metals) would have sunk towards the center due to gravity, forming the core.\n\n(D) Metals are more resistant to heat and pressure, so they survived at the core while other materials melted away.\n- While metals are indeed more resistant to heat and pressure, this explanation is incomplete. It doesn't fully account for the process of differentiation that led to the formation of the core.\n\n(E) The entire planets are made mostly of metal.\n- This is incorrect. Terrestrial planets are not primarily composed of metal; they are primarily composed of silicate rocks and metals.\n\n(F) Radioactivity created metals in the core from the decay of uranium.\n- While radioactivity does play a role in the planet's thermal evolution, it does not explain the initial formation of the core.\n\n(G) Metals condensed first in the solar nebula and the rocks then accreted around them.\n- This is a possible explanation, but it doesn't directly address the process of core formation within the planet.\n\n(H) Asteroids and comets delivered metals to the core during the early stages of the planet's formation.\n- While this could have contributed to the core, it is not the primary mechanism for core formation.\n\n(C) is the most accurate explanation for why terrestrial planet cores contain mostly metal.

        "To determine the correct answer, let's first understand the implications of the Moon's orbital plane being exactly the same as the ecliptic plane.\n\n1. **Current Situation:**\n   - The Moon's orbital plane (called the lunar orbital plane) is inclined at about 5.145\u00b0 relative to the ecliptic plane. This inclination means that the Moon's position relative to the Sun changes throughout its orbit, leading to variations in the types and durations of eclipses.\n\n2. **Scenario with the Moon's Orbital Plane Exactly the Same as the Ecliptic Plane:**\n   - If the Moon's orbital plane were exactly the same as the ecliptic plane, the Moon would always be in the same plane as the Earth and the Sun. This would mean that the Moon would always be in a position to potentially block the Sun or the Earth from the Sun, leading to different eclipse phenomena.\n\n3. **Effect on Lunar Eclipses:**\n   - With the Moon and Earth in the same plane, the Moon would always be in a position to cast a shadow on the Earth during a full moon, leading to total lunar eclipses. However, the duration of these eclipses would not change because the geometry of the Earth and Moon relative to the Sun would remain the same. Therefore, option (A) and (B) are incorrect.\n\n4. **Effect on Solar Eclipses:**\n   - Solar eclipses occur when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, casting its shadow on the Earth. If the Moon's orbital plane were exactly the same as the ecliptic plane, the Moon would be in the correct position to create a solar eclipse more frequently. The frequency and duration of solar eclipses would be more consistent, and solar eclipses would be much more frequent.\n\n5. **Effect on Eclipses in General:**\n   - Since the Moon would always be in a position to create both types of eclipses, the occurrence of both lunar and solar eclipses would be more predictable and frequent.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the most significant effect would be that solar eclipses would be much more frequent.\n\nFinal Answer: (H)",

This principle is fundamental in understanding wave propagation and is most commonly applied to light, which behaves as a wave.\n\nGiven the options, the correct description for Huygens' principle in the context of light would be related to the nature of light as a wave.\n\nFinal Answer: (E) waves",
        "When the temperature of a strip of iron is increased, the length of the strip generally increases due to thermal expansion. This phenomenon occurs because the atoms in the metal vibrate more with increased temperature, causing the material to expand. This expansion is consistent and proportional to the temperature change, leading to a linear increase in length.\n\nGiven this understanding, the correct option is:\n\nFinal Answer: (G) \"also increases.\"",
        "To solve this, let's first consider the fact that the Moon always shows the same face to Earth. This phenomenon is known as tidal locking. Tidal locking occurs when a gravitational interaction between two bodies results in one body completing one rotation per orbit around the other. \n\nThe Moon takes about 27.3 days to complete one orbit around the Earth (its sidereal period). Due to tidal locking, the Moon also takes about 27.3 days to complete one rotation on its axis. Therefore, the Moon rotates about its axis once per sidereal month.\n\nNow, let's match this with the given options:\n\n(A): \"day\" - This is incorrect because the Moon's rotation period is much longer than a day.\n(B): \"decade\" - This is incorrect because a decade is 10 years, which is much longer than the Moon's rotation period.\n(C): \"it does not rotate, it revolves around the Earth.\" - This is incorrect because the Moon does rotate, but it is tidally locked.\n(D): \"it rotates twice in a month\" - This is incorrect because the Moon rotates once per month, not twice.\n(E): \"it rotates once every two months\" - This is incorrect because the Moon rotates once per month, not every two months.\n(F): \"year\" - This is incorrect because a year is much longer than the Moon's rotation period.\n(G): \"century\" - This is incorrect because a century is 100 years, which is much longer than the Moon's rotation period.\n(H): \"week\" - This is incorrect because a week is much shorter than the Moon's rotation period.\n(I): \"None of these for the moon does not rotate about an axis\" - This is incorrect because the Moon does rotate, but it is tidally locked.\n(J): \"month\" - This is correct because the Moon takes about 27.3 days to complete one rotation, which is roughly a month.\n\nFinal Answer: (J)",

        "To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of conservation of energy and the relationship between mass and energy (E=mc\u00b2).\n\n1. **Conservation of Energy**: The total energy released in the decay is equal to the kinetic energy of the proton and electron. Let's denote the total energy released as \\(E\\).\n\n2. **Mass Relationship**: The mass of a proton is 1836 times the mass of an electron. Let \\(m_e\\) be the mass of an electron, and \\(m_p = 1836m_e\\) be the mass of a proton.\n\n3. **Kinetic Energy**: The kinetic energy of a particle is given by \\(KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\). However, in the context of this problem, we are dealing with relativistic energies, so we use the relativistic kinetic energy formula. The total energy of a particle is \\(E = mc^2\\), where \\(c\\) is the speed of light. The kinetic energy is then \\(KE = E - mc^2\\).\n\n4. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy released \\(E\\) is split between the proton and the electron. Let \\(E_p\\) be the energy of the proton and \\(E_e\\) be the energy of the electron. Since the total energy released is \\(E\\), we have \\(E_p + E_e = E\\).\n\n5. **Relativistic Kinetic Energy**: The relativistic kinetic energy of the proton and electron can be expressed as:\n   - For the proton: \\(E_p = m_p c^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_p v_p^2\\)\n   - For the electron: \\(E_e = m_e c^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_e v_e^2\\)\n\nHowever, in the limit where the velocities are non-relativistic (which is a good approximation for the electron, but not necessarily for the proton), the kinetic energy can be approximated by the non-relativistic formula. But since the proton is much heavier, its kinetic energy will be much smaller compared to the electron's, and we can use the mass ratio to find the fraction of the total energy that goes into the proton's kinetic energy.\n\nGiven that the mass of the proton is 1836 times the mass of the electron, the electron will have a much higher kinetic energy compared to the proton. The fraction of the total energy that goes into the proton's kinetic energy can be approximated by the inverse of the mass ratio, i.e., \\(\\frac{1}{1836}\\).\n\nSo, the fraction of the total energy released that goes into the kinetic energy of the proton is \\(\\frac{1}{1836} \\approx 0.000544\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (D).\n\nFinal Answer: (D)",

The object will continue to fall at this speed without increasing or decreasing its speed.\n\n4. **Initial Behavior**: Initially, the object is falling under the influence of gravity alone. The drag force is small because the speed is low. As the speed increases, the drag force increases, reducing the net acceleration.\n\n5. **Acceleration**: The object starts with a high acceleration due to gravity, but as the speed increases, the drag force increases, causing the net acceleration to decrease. This continues until the object reaches terminal speed, at which point the acceleration is zero.\n\n6. **Speed**: The speed of the object increases from zero as it falls, but as it approaches terminal speed, the speed increases more slowly because the drag force is becoming a significant portion of the gravitational force.\n\nGiven these points, the correct description of the motion is:\n\n- The object will fall with increasing speed.\n- The acceleration will decrease as the object approaches terminal speed.\n\nThis matches option (E): \"It will fall with increasing speed and decreasing acceleration.\"\n\nFinal Answer: E",

        "To determine which change would decrease the period of the pendulum, we need to consider the formula for the period of a simple pendulum, which is given by:\n\n\\[ T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{g}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( T \\) is the period,\n- \\( L \\) is the length of the pendulum,\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nFrom this formula, we can see that the period \\( T \\) is directly proportional to the square root of the length \\( L \\) and inversely proportional to the square root of the acceleration due to gravity \\( g \\).\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n(A) \"Releasing the string from a higher point\" - This does not change the length of the pendulum, so it will not affect the period.\n\n(B) \"Increasing the angle of the string from the horizontal when released\" - This will not change the period because the period is primarily determined by the length and gravity, not the initial angle (for small angles, the period is independent of the initial angle).\n\n(C) \"Decreasing the angle of the string from the horizontal when released\" - Similar to option B, the period is not significantly affected by the initial angle for small angles.\n\n(D) \"Decreasing the mass of the ball\" - The period is independent of the mass of the ball, so this will not change the period.\n\n(E) \"Increasing the length of the string\" - This will increase the period, as the period is directly proportional to the square root of the length.\n\n(F) \"Releasing the ball from a lower point\" - This does not change the length of the pendulum, so it will not affect the period.\n\n(G) \"Decreasing the length of the string\" - This will decrease the period, as the period is directly proportional to the square root of the length.\n\n(H) \"Increasing the mass of the ball\" - The period is independent of the mass of the ball, so this will not change the period.\n\n(I) \"Decreasing the gravity acting on the ball\" - This will decrease the period, as the period is inversely proportional to the square root of the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nFinal Answer: G/I",
        "To determine the correct option, let's analyze the behavior of the image formed by a concave mirror as the object is moved from far away to near the focal point.\n\n1. **Far away from the mirror (object distance \\(d_o \\to \\infty\\)):**\n   - The image is formed at the focal point \\(F\\) and is very small (magnification \\(m \\to 0\\)).\n   - The image is real, inverted, and highly diminished.\n\n2. **Moving towards the focal point:**\n   - As the object moves closer to the focal point, the image distance \\(d_i\\) increases.\n   - The magnification \\(m = -\\frac{d_i}{d_o}\\) increases in magnitude, meaning the image gets larger.\n   - The image remains real and inverted.\n\n3. **At the focal point:**\n   - The image is at infinity and the magnification is theoretically infinite, but in practical terms, the image is not formed because the object and image coincide.\n\n4. **Closer than the focal point (object distance \\(d_o < f\\)):**\n   - The image is formed between the focal point and the mirror.\n   - The image is real, inverted, and larger than the object.\n   - The magnification is still negative and its magnitude increases as the object moves closer to the focal point.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that as the object moves from far away to near the focal point, the image moves away from the mirror and gets taller.\n\n**Final Answer: B**",

        "To determine the correct answer, let's consider the relationship between temperature and the energy states of a substance.\n\nTemperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. This includes both translational and rotational kinetic energy, but in many cases, especially at high temperatures, the vibrational kinetic energy also contributes significantly. However, the term \"average translational kinetic energy\" is the most general and widely used to describe the relationship between temperature and the energy of particles.\n\nGiven this, the most accurate option is:\n\nFinal Answer: (G) \"average translational kinetic energy.\"",
        "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of resultant velocity. The airspeed of the airplane and the crosswind are perpendicular to each other, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the groundspeed.\n\nThe airspeed is 40 km/h and the crosswind is 30 km/h. The groundspeed \\( V_g \\) can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ V_g = \\sqrt{(airspeed)^2 + (crosswind)^2} \\]\n\\[ V_g = \\sqrt{40^2 + 30^2} \\]\n\\[ V_g = \\sqrt{1600 + 900} \\]\n\\[ V_g = \\sqrt{2500} \\]\n\\[ V_g = 50 \\text{ km/h} \\]\n\nTherefore, the groundspeed of the airplane is 50 km/h.\n\nFinal Answer: (C)",
        "To solve this problem, let's consider the properties of a parallel circuit. In a parallel circuit, the voltage across each component is the same, and the current splits between the components based on their resistances.\n\nGiven that the lamps are in parallel, the voltage across each lamp is the same. If the current in one lamp is 2 A, we need to determine the current in the other lamp. The key point here is that in a parallel circuit, the current can split in such a way that it is not necessarily the same in both branches unless the resistances are equal.\n\nHowever, without additional information about the resistances of the lamps, we cannot definitively say what the current in the other lamp will be. The current in the other lamp could be different from 2 A, and it could be higher, lower, or equal to 2 A depending on the resistance of that lamp.\n\nGiven the options, the most accurate answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: (H) Not enough information to say",
        "Let's analyze the options based on the behavior of atoms when they emit alpha or beta particles.\n\n1. **Alpha Particle Emission:**\n   - An alpha particle is equivalent to a helium-4 nucleus, consisting of 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n   - Emission of an alpha particle decreases the atomic number by 2 and the mass number by 4.\n   - Therefore, the atom changes to an atom of a different element (since the atomic number changes).\n\n2. **Beta Particle Emission:**\n   - Beta particles can be either electrons or positrons.\n   - Beta decay changes the number of neutrons to protons or vice versa, changing the atomic number by 1 while the mass number remains the same.\n   - Therefore, the atom changes to an atom of a different element (since the atomic number changes).\n\nGiven this information, we can see that both alpha and beta particle emissions result in the atom becoming an atom of a different element.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A): \"changes its atomic number but remains the same element.\" - Incorrect, as the atomic number changes.\n(B): \"becomes an atom of a different element always.\" - Correct, as both alpha and beta emissions change the element.\n(C): \"remains the same element and isotope.\" - Incorrect, as the element changes.\n(D): \"becomes a different element with the same atomic mass.\" - Correct for beta emission, but incorrect for alpha emission.\n(E): \"becomes an atom of a different element sometimes.\" - Correct, as it is true but less precise than option B.\n(F): \"decreases its mass.\" - Incorrect, as the mass number decreases in alpha emission but remains the same in beta emission.\n(G): \"becomes an ion of the same element.\" - Incorrect, as the element changes.\n(H): \"may become an atom of a different element.\" - Correct, but less precise than option B.\n(I): \"becomes a different isotope of the same element.\" - Incorrect, as the element changes.\n(J): \"increases its mass.\" - Incorrect, as the mass number decreases in alpha emission and remains the same in beta emission.\n\nThe most precise and accurate option is (B).\n\nFinal Answer: B"
