        "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Ken starts with an empty box and adds enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds. So, the weight of the jelly beans is 2 pounds.\n2. Then, he adds enough brownies to triple the weight. Since the weight of the jelly beans is 2 pounds, the weight of the brownies is 2 x 3 = 6 pounds. The total weight is now 2 + 6 = 8 pounds.\n3. Next, he adds another 2 pounds of jelly beans. The total weight is now 8 + 2 = 10 pounds.\n4. Finally, he adds enough gummy worms to double the weight once again. Since the weight is 10 pounds, the weight of the gummy worms is 10 x 2 = 20 pounds. The final weight is 10 + 20 = 30 pounds.\n\nFinal Answer: 30",

To find out how much she spent on the shoes, we can subtract the amount she has left from the amount she had available:\n\n$57 - $16 = $41\n\nFinal Answer: $41",
        "Let's break this down step by step!\n\nFor the first 8 hours of each day, Tina makes her regular hourly wage of $18.00. So, for 5 days, she makes:\n\n8 hours/day x 5 days x $18.00/hour = $720.00\n\nFor the remaining 2 hours of each day (since she works 10 hours), Tina is eligible for overtime. Overtime pay is her regular hourly wage plus half of her regular hourly wage. So, her overtime pay is:\n\n$18.00 (regular wage) + $9.00 (half of regular wage) = $27.00/hour\n\nFor 5 days, she works 2 hours/day x 5 days = 10 hours of overtime. Her overtime pay is:\n\n10 hours x $27.00/hour = $270.00\n\nNow, let's add her regular pay and overtime pay to find her total earnings:\n\n$720.00 (regular pay) + $270.00 (overtime pay) = $990.00\n\nFinal Answer: $990.00",
        "Let's start by using the information that the monster has consumed 847 people over 300 years. This means that the monster has eaten 847/300 = 2.845 people per year on average.\n\nSince the monster eats a ship every 100 years, we can find the number of people on the first ship it ate by dividing the total number of people consumed by the number of years it takes to eat a ship. This gives us:\n\n847 people / 100 years = 8.47 people per year\n\nSince the ship is eaten every 100 years, we can multiply the number of people per year by 100 to get the total number of people on the first ship:\n\n8.47 people/year * 100 years = 847 people\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer because we are told that each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. This means that the number of people on the first ship is half the number of people on the second ship, and one-quarter the number of people on the third ship.\n\nSince the total number of people consumed is 847, we can find the number of people on the second ship by dividing 847 by 2 (since it has twice as many people as the first ship):\n\n847 people / 2 = 423.5 people\n\nThe number of people on the third ship is then:\n\n423.5 people / 2 = 211.75 people\n\nThe number of people on the first ship is then:\n\n211.75 people / 4 = 53.44 people\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 53.",
        "Let's break this problem down step by step.\n\nTobias has been saving up his money for 3 months. He gets a $5 allowance each month, so he has saved $5 x 3 = $15 from his allowance.\n\nHe also mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel a driveway. He mows 4 lawns, so he has earned $15 x 4 = $60 from mowing lawns.\n\nAfter buying the shoes, Tobias has $15 in change. The shoes cost $95, so he must have had $95 + $15 = $110 before buying the shoes.\n\nHe has saved $15 from his allowance and earned $60 from mowing lawns, so he had $15 + $60 = $75 before mowing lawns. This means he earned $110 - $75 = $35 from shoveling driveways.\n\nHe charges $7 per driveway, so he must have shoveled $35 \u00f7 $7 = 5 driveways.\n\nFinal Answer: 5",

To find half as many coconut trees as mango trees, we can divide 60 by 2:\n\n60 \u00f7 2 = 30\n\nSo, he has 30 coconut trees. But it says \"5 less than half as many\", so we need to subtract 5 from 30:\n\n30 - 5 = 25\n\nRandy has 25 coconut trees.\n\nTo find the total number of trees, we add the number of mango trees and coconut trees:\n\n60 (mango trees) + 25 (coconut trees) = 85\n\nFinal Answer: 85",

He sells 500 movies a day for 5 days a week, which is a total of 2500 DVDs per week.\n5. He sells DVDs for 20 weeks.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the weekly profit:\n\nWeekly profit = Total revenue - Total cost\nTotal revenue = Number of DVDs sold per week x Price per DVD\nTotal cost = Number of DVDs sold per week x Cost per DVD\nWeekly profit = 2500 x $15 - 2500 x $6\nWeekly profit = $37,500 - $15,000\nWeekly profit = $22,500\n\nSince James sells DVDs for 20 weeks, the total profit is:\n\nTotal profit = Weekly profit x Number of weeks\nTotal profit = $22,500 x 20\nTotal profit = $450,000\n\nFinal Answer: $450,000",
        "Let's start by identifying the total amount of profit. Since Johnson got $2500, we can set up an equation based on the ratio:\n\n5/7 \u00d7 Total Profit = 2500\n\nTo find the total profit, we can multiply both sides by 7/5:\n\nTotal Profit = 2500 \u00d7 (7/5) = 3500\n\nNow that we know the total profit is $3500, we can find Mike's share:\n\n2/7 \u00d7 3500 = 1000\n\nSo Mike's initial share is $1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will be left with:\n\n1000 - 200 = 800\n\nFinal Answer: 800",

To find the number of balls he hit, multiply 100 by 2/5:\n\n100 x (2/5) = 100 x 0.4 = 40\n\nSo, Ralph hit 40 out of the first 100 balls.\n\nThat means he didn't hit 100 - 40 = 60 balls out of the first 100.\n\nNow, let's move on to the next 75 balls. He manages to hit 1/3 of them. To find the number of balls he hit, multiply 75 by 1/3:\n\n75 x (1/3) = 75 x 0.33 = 25\n\nSo, Ralph hit 25 out of the next 75 balls.\n\nThat means he didn't hit 75 - 25 = 50 balls out of the next 75.\n\nTo find the total number of balls Ralph didn't hit, add the number of balls he didn't hit in the first 100 and the next 75:\n\n60 + 50 = 110\n\nSo, Ralph didn't hit 110 out of the total 175 tennis balls.\n\nFinal Answer: 110",

But, 3/5 of them were irrelevant. To find 3/5 of 400, you can multiply 400 by 0.6 (since 3/5 is the same as 0.6):\n\n400 x 0.6 = 240\n\nSo, he deleted 240 files from the new batch, leaving him with:\n\n400 - 240 = 160\n\nfiles.\n\nNow, let's combine the remaining files from both batches:\n\n240 (remaining files from initial batch) + 160 (remaining files from new batch) = 400\n\nfiles.\n\nFinal Answer: 400",
