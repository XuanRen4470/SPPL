Next, we need to move the orange block to the side. We can do this by unstacking it from the blue block and putting it down.

        "Let's analyze the situation.\n\nIn the initial condition, the orange block is clear, which means it's not on top of any other block.

The yellow block is also on top of the blue block, which means the blue block is on the bottom.\n\nTo achieve the goal, we need to have the red block on top of the orange block and the blue block on top of the red block.
