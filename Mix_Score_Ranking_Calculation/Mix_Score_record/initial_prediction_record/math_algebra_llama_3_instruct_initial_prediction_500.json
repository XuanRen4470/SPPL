        "Let's break this problem down step by step!\n\nLet the total number of people in the room be x.\n\nSince two-thirds of the people are seated, the number of seated people is (2/3)x.\n\nSince three-fourths of the chairs are occupied, the number of occupied chairs is (3/4)y, where y is the total number of chairs.\n\nWe know that the number of seated people is equal to the number of occupied chairs, so we can set up the equation:\n\n(2/3)x = (3/4)y\n\nTo solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by 12, which is the least common multiple of 3 and 4:\n\n4x = 9y\n\nSince there are 6 empty chairs, the total number of chairs is y = 6 + (1/4)y (since (1/4)y is the number of empty chairs).\n\nSubstituting this expression for y into the equation above, we get:\n\n4x = 9(6 + (1/4)y)\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n4x = 54 + 9/4y\n\nSubtracting 54 from both sides, we get:\n\n4x - 54 = 9/4y\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4, we get:\n\n16x - 216 = 9y\n\nSince x is the number of people and y is the number of chairs, we know that x is an integer. Therefore, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9:\n\n16x/9 - 216/9 = y\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n16x/9 - 24 = y\n\nNow we can substitute y = 6 + (1/4)y into this equation:\n\n16x/9 - 24 = 6 + (1/4)y\n\nSubtracting 6 from both sides, we get:\n\n16x/9 - 30 = (1/4)y\n\nMultiplying both sides by 9, we get:\n\n16x - 270 = 9y\n\nSubstituting y = 6 + (1/4)y, we get:\n\n16x - 270 = 9(6 + (1/4)y)\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n16x - 270 = 54 + 9/4y\n\nSubtracting 54 from both sides, we get:\n\n16x - 324 = 9/4y\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4, we get:\n\n64x - 1296 = 9y\n\nSince x is the number of people and y is the number of chairs, we know that x is an integer.

Therefore, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9:\n\n256x/9 - 625 = y\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n256x/9 - 625 = 6 + (1/4)y\n\nSubtracting 6 from both sides, we get:\n\n256x/9 - 631 = (1/4)y\n\nMultiplying both sides by 9, we get:\n\n256x - 5688 = 9y\n\nSubstituting y = 6 + (1/4)y, we get:\n\n256x - 5688 = 9(6 + (1/4)y)\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n256x - 5688 = 54 + 9/4y\n\nSubtracting 54 from both sides, we get:\n\n256x - 5742 = 9/4y\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4, we get:\n\n1024x - 22968 = 9y\n\nSince x is the number of people and y is the number of chairs, we know that x is an integer.

The formula for a perfect square trinomial is $x^2 + 2xy + y^2$, where $2xy$ is the middle term. In this case, we need $2xy = -16$, so $xy = -8$. Since $x^2$ and $y^2$ are squares, they are both positive, so $x$ and $y$ must have the same sign. Therefore, $x$ and $y$ are both positive or both negative.\n\nNow, we can solve for $x$ and $y$: $$x^2 - 16x + k = x^2 - 16x + 64 - 64 + k = (x - 8)^2 - 64 + k.$$To make this a perfect square trinomial, we need $-64 + k = y^2$.

Therefore, $m$ and $n$ must both be roots of the quadratic, so they are equidistant from the axis of symmetry, meaning $m+n=2$.  Since $m>n$, we know that $n<2$, and since the parabola opens upward, we know that $m>2$.  Since the parabola passes through $(4,12)$, we have $12=a(4)^2+b(4)+c$, so $12=16a+4b+c$.

This can be simplified to $abx+a^2+b=x$.  Since this is true for all $x$, we can set each side equal to each other and solve for $a$ and $b$.  Doing so, we get $a^2-ab+1=0$.
