        "The Navarrese took advantage of John II's captivity in England starting from around 1363. They saw an opportunity to seize power while the French crown was weak due to John's captivity and the young age of the Dauphin. Edward III supported their moves, hoping to gain control over northern and western provinces. The peace negotiations were deliberately slowed by Edward, and the Battle of Cocherel, a crushing defeat for the Navarrese, took place in 1364.\n\nFinal Answer: The Navarrese used John II's captivity for approximately one year, from around 1363 to 1364.",
        "Inference: John II's replacement, Charles V, was also held captive in England after his father's death. However, unlike John II, Charles V did not feel honor-bound to remain in captivity.

Therefore, we can infer that there were fewer inhabitants of Paris held as hostages than the number of John II's sons.\n\nFinal Answer: The passage mentions that there were four inhabitants of Paris held as hostages, while there were at least two of John II's sons who were also hostages. Therefore, there were fewer inhabitants of Paris held as hostages than the number of John II's sons.",
        "The passage mentions that two citizens from each of the nineteen principal towns of France were to be held as hostages. So, the total number of citizens who could be held as hostages in lieu of John II would be:\n\n2 citizens/town * 19 towns = 38 citizens\n\nFinal Answer: 38 citizens",
        "The French dispute with Navarre began in 1354. The Navarrese saw an opportunity to seize power while John II was in captivity in England, which started in the late 1360s (specifically, John's son Louis of Anjou escaped captivity in 1362). Edward III supported the Navarrese moves, deliberately slowing peace negotiations. John II died in captivity in London in 1364.\n\nSo, the time between the French dispute with Navarre and the leverage of John II's captivity is approximately ten years.\n\nFinal Answer: Ten years.",
        "Based on the information provided in the passage, John II returned to captivity in England after his son Louis of Anjou escaped in 1362. The passage does not explicitly state the year John II died, but it does mention that he died in London in 1364.

        "John II's son Louis of Anjou escaped from English-held Calais in 1362. John II died in London in 1364. Therefore, John II died two years after his son's escape from English captivity.\n\nFinal Answer: John II died two years after his son's escape from English-held Calais.",
        "The Navarrese attempted to seize power in France while John II was in captivity in London. The specific year when this attempt occurred is not mentioned in the passage, but it can be inferred that it happened before John II's death in 1364. Therefore, the timeframe for the Navarrese power grab is approximately three years or less before John II's death.\n\nFinal Answer: The Navarrese attempted to seize power in France approximately three years or less before John II's death in London.",
        "Based on the information provided in the passage, there were several princes and nobles, four inhabitants of Paris, two citizens from each of the nineteen principal towns of France, and one son of the French king, Louis of Anjou, who were held hostage in lieu of John II. Therefore, there were a total of (2 citizens x 19 towns) + (princes, nobles, inhabitants of Paris, and one son) = (38 citizens) + (number of princes, nobles, and inhabitants of Paris) groups held hostage. However, the number of princes, nobles, and inhabitants of Paris is not explicitly stated in the passage, so it cannot be determined with certainty.\n\nFinal Answer: We cannot determine the exact number of groups held hostage as the number of princes, nobles, and inhabitants of Paris is not explicitly stated in the passage.",

        "Based on the information provided in the passage, John II was the king of France before Charles V. John II was captured in England and held as a prisoner while trying to raise funds to pay his ransom. During this time, the Navarrese tried to seize power in France, with Edward III of England supporting their moves. John II died in London in 1364 while still in captivity. After his death, Charles V succeeded him as the king of France.\n\nFinal Answer: John II was the king of France before Charles V.",
        "The Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny was signed before the Battle of Cocherel took place. The reasons for this inference are as follows:\n\n1. The passage states that the Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny was signed in 1360 and set John II's ransom at 3 million crowns, allowing for hostages to be held in lieu of him.\n2. The passage also mentions that John II's son Louis of Anjou, a hostage in English-held Calais, escaped captivity in 1362, and John felt honor-bound to return to captivity in England as a result.\n3. The Battle of Cocherel occurred on May 16, 1364.\n4. Therefore, since the Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny was in place before John II's son escaped captivity, and the battle occurred after John's death in 1364, it must have been the Treaty that came before the Battle of Cocherel.\n\nFinal Answer: The Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny occurred before the Battle of Cocherel.",
        "The passage mentions several groups of people who were held hostage in place of John II. These include:\n\n1. Two of his sons\n2. Several princes and nobles\n3. Four inhabitants of Paris\n4. Two citizens from each of the nineteen principal towns of France\n\nHowever, the passage does not provide an exact number for each of these groups. To find an estimate, we can assume that the number of princes and nobles is likely to be less than ten, since they are mentioned in the same sentence as the inhabitants of Paris and the citizens from the nineteen towns. Similarly, since there are two citizens from each of the nineteen towns, that would be a total of 38 citizens. Adding this to the two sons, several princes and nobles, and the four inhabitants of Paris, we get a minimum estimate of around 20 people being held hostage in place of John II.\n\nFinal Answer: At least 20 people were held hostage in place of John II.",
        "John II returned to captivity in England in 1362. He died in London in 1364. So, John II lived for two years after returning to captivity in England.\n\nFinal Answer: John II lived for two years after returning to captivity in England in 1362.",

        "Based on the information provided in the passage, the percentage of people who were not from two or more races was 88.09%. This is because the passage states that 1.91% of the population were from one or more of the specific races listed (Race, Race, Race, Race, Race, Asian, and Native American), and the total percentage of the population accounted for by all the listed races was 98.99% (86.77% + 9.27% + 0.23% + 1.52% + 0.06% + 0.69% + 1.47%). Therefore, the remaining percentage must be the percentage of people who were not from any of the listed races, which is 100% - 98.99% = 1.01%, or approximately 1% when rounded to the nearest whole number. Since we are asked for the percentage that is not 1.5 or more races, we can subtract the percentage of people who identified as being from 1.5 or more races (1.91%) from the total percentage of the population (100%), to find that 98.09% of the population identified as being from one race only. Since we are looking for the percentage of people who were not from 2 or more races, we can subtract the percentage of people who identified as being from 2 or more races (1.47%) from the percentage of people who identified as being from one race only (98.09%), to find that 96.62% of the population identified as being from one race only or not from 2 or more races. However, since the percentage of people who identified as being from one race only is approximately 1% less than 100%, it is reasonable to round up to 100% and then subtract the percentage of people who identified as being from 2 or more races to find the percentage of people who were not from 2 or more races.

However, the passage states that the first pass was 3 yards long and the second pass was 12 yards long, which means the second pass was 9 yards longer than the first one. So, the answer is correct even though it was stated incorrectly in the passage. (The passage states that the second pass was 3 yards shorter than the first one, but that is a mistake.)",
        "Inference: Philip Rivers' second touchdown pass was 1 yard longer than Matt Hasselbeck's touchdown pass.\n\nExplanation: The passage states that Philip Rivers completed a touchdown pass to TE Antonio Gates for a distance of 12 yards, while Matt Hasselbeck completed a touchdown pass to TE John Carlson for a distance of 9 yards. Therefore, the difference in yards between the two touchdown passes is 3 yards (12 yards for Rivers' pass - 9 yards for Hasselbeck's pass). However, the question asks for the difference in yards between the two touchdown passes in terms of how much longer Rivers' pass was compared to Hasselbeck's pass, which means we need to find the difference in a positive sense. Thus, the answer is that Rivers' pass was 3 yards longer than Hasselbeck's pass, but since we are asked to find the difference in terms of how much more yards Rivers' pass had, we need to add 3 yards to the difference to get the answer. Therefore, the difference in yards is 3 yards + 3 yards = 6 yards. However, the passage states that the difference is 1 yard, not 6 yards. This discrepancy suggests that there might be an error in the passage or that there is some missing information that could change the answer. Therefore, it is important to note that the answer provided is based on the given information and might not be accurate if there are errors or missing information in the passage.\n\nFinal Answer: The passage contains an error or missing information, and it is impossible to determine with certainty how many yards longer Philip Rivers' second touchdown pass was compared to Matt Hasselbeck's touchdown pass based on the given information alone.",

In the fourth quarter, they scored a touchdown on a 6-yard pass to Delanie Walker and a field goal from 37 yards out.\n\nFinal Answer: The San Francisco 49ers gained a total of 105 yards offensively during this game (1-yard rushing TD, 55-yard field goal, and 37-yard field goal), as well as 2 points from the safety. They also gained an additional 1 yard on a penalty against Detroit. So the total yards gained by the San Francisco 49ters was 108 yards.",
        "Based on the information provided in the passage, there were a total of three field goals attempted between 30 and 40 yards. The first one was made by Jason Hanson of the Lions from 25 yards, which is slightly under 30 yards. However, the other two field goals were made by David Akers of the 49ers, one from 55 yards and the other from 31 yards. Both of these field goals fall within the range of 30 to 40 yards.\n\nFinal Answer: There were two field goals made between 30 and 40 yards, both by David Akers of the San Francisco 49ers.",
        "Based on the information provided in the passage, there were a total of three field goals attempted between 20 and 30 yards. The first one was made by Jason Hanson from 25 yards out for the Lions in the first quarter. The second one was made by David Akers from 55 yards out for the 49ers just before halftime. Although the yardage of the third field goal is not explicitly stated in the passage, it can be inferred that it was between 20 and 30 yards based on the description that it was a \"field goal\" and no other specific yardage is mentioned for the Lions' field goal in the fourth quarter.\n\nFinal Answer: There were a total of three field goals made between 20 and 30 yards.",
        "The Lions scored one field goal in the second half, while the 49ers scored two field goals in the second half. However, the passage mentions that the Lions scored a field goal after halftime but does not specify the yardage. To determine if it was indeed a field goal and not a touchdown, we need to look for other information in the passage.\n\nThe passage states that \"Detroit scored on a 24-yard field goal\" in the fourth quarter. Since the passage uses the term \"field goal\" specifically and consistently throughout the text, we can infer that the Lions scored exactly one field goal in the second half.\n\nTherefore, the 49ers scored two more field goals than the Lions in the second half.\n\nFinal Answer: The 49ers scored two more field goals than the Lions in the second half.",
        "Inference: The second shortest field goal was scored by David Akers of the San Francisco 49ers, and its length was 31 yards.\n\nFinal Answer: 31 yards.",

Therefore, it is unclear from the information given which kicker is being referred to in the specific instance mentioned in the question.\n\nFinal Answer: It is not clear from the information given which kicker, Jeff Wilkins or Lawrence Tynes, made the 41-yard field goal mentioned in the question.",
        "Based on the context of the passage, it mentions that the Rams were looking to rebound from a road loss in Week 8. Therefore, the team that the Rams lost to in Week 8 must be the Chargers.\n\nFinal Answer: The Rams lost to the Chargers in Week 8.",
        "Based on the information provided in the passage, the Rams had one loss in week 8 against the Chargers. The passage describes their game against the Chiefs in week 9, and mentions their previous loss to the Chargers as a context. Therefore, the Rams had a total of 5 games up to this point, with 4 wins and 2 losses.\n\nFinal Answer: The Rams had 2 losses in total up to week 9, with one of those losses occurring in week 8 against the Chargers.",

        "Based on the information provided in the passage, the two field goals mentioned are those of Lawrence Tynes for the Chiefs with a length of 42 yards and Jeff Wilkins for the Rams also with a length of 41 yards. Therefore, neither team scored a field goal with a length greater than the one mentioned here. However, the question asks for the \"second-longest\" field goal kick of the game, which implies that there was another longer field goal. Since the passage does not provide information about any other field goals, it is likely that the question contains an error and the answer is not provided in the passage.\n\nFinal Answer: The passage does not provide the answer to the question as it does not mention any field goal longer than the ones kicked by Tynes and Wilkins.",
        "The longest field goal of the game was kicked by Lawrence Tynes for the Chiefs, and it was for 42 yards.

        "Based on the information provided in the passage, we can infer that there were a total of 10 touchdowns scored during the game (5 by the Chiefs and 5 by the Rams). Each touchdown is the result of a play, and we know that the Chiefs' first touchdown was a 1-yard run, so that's one play under 5 yards. The Rams' first touchdown was a 2-yard run, so that's another play under 5 yards.\n\nIn the second quarter, the Chiefs scored a 3-yard touchdown pass, and the Rams scored a 2-yard touchdown pass and a 2-yard touchdown run. In the third quarter, the Rams scored a 2-yard touchdown pass. In the fourth quarter, the Chiefs scored an 11-yard touchdown pass.\n\nSo, based on this information, we can infer that there were a total of 7 plays under 5 yards during the game (the Chiefs' first touchdown, the Rams' first touchdown, and 5 other plays).\n\nFinal Answer: There were 7 plays under 5 yards during the game.",

        "Based on the information provided in the passage, it is not clear how many plays were shorter than 5 yards in each half of the game, as the passage focuses primarily on the touchdowns and field goals scored by both teams. However, we can see that in the first half, there were two touchdowns and two field goals, while in the second half, there was one touchdown and one field goal. It's also worth noting that in the first half, the Rams' longest touchdown was 2 yards, while in the second half, their longest touchdown was 25 yards. It's possible that there were more plays shorter than 5 yards in the first half, but without more specific information, it's impossible to say for certain.\n\nFinal Answer: The passage does not provide enough information to determine whether there were more plays shorter than 5 yards in the first half or the second half of the game.",

        "Based on the information provided in the passage, it appears that Tony Gonzalez caught two touchdown passes in the first half, while Kevin Curtis and Kris Wilson each caught one touchdown pass. However, since the question asks for the most touchdown catches by an individual player in the first half, the answer would be Tony Gonzalez, with a total of two touchdown receptions.\n\nFinal Answer: Tony Gonzalez caught the most touchdown passes in the first half, with a total of two touchdown receptions.",
        "Based on the information provided in the passage, Tony Gonzalez's first touchdown was for a distance of 3 yards, and his second touchdown was for a distance of 25 yards. Therefore, the difference in yardage between the two touchdowns is 22 yards (25 yards for the second touchdown minus 3 yards for the first touchdown).\n\nFinal Answer: Tony Gonzalez's second touchdown was 22 yards longer than his first touchdown.",

Additionally, the passage describes several instances of the Patriots scoring touchdowns and taking the lead in the game, while there is no mention of the Packers scoring any touchdowns in the fourth quarter, which further supports the inference that the Patriots were the winning team.\n\nFinal Answer: The Patriots won the game against the Packers.",
        "The initial registration of 10 million men in the United States for the military draft in 1917 was deemed inadequate by the administration to meet their target of raising military manpower for the war.\n\nFinal Answer: The initial registration of 10 million men for the military draft in 1917 was considered inadequate.",
        "The draft was universal because the United States government decided to make it a requirement for all eligible men to register and potentially be inducted into the military during World War I. This was necessary due to the low number of volunteers and the need to raise a large military force quickly.

A number of radicals and anarchists argued that the draft was a violation of the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude.\n\nThe Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision on January 7, 1918, upheld the constitutionality of the draft act. The Court reasoned that the Thirteenth Amendment did not apply to the draft because the drafted individuals were not being compelled to labor against their will, but rather were being conscripted into the military to defend their country.\n\nFinal Answer: The Selective Draft Law Cases held that the draft was constitutional because the Thirteenth Amendment did not apply, as the drafted individuals were not being compelled to labor against their will but rather being conscripted into the military to defend their country.",

It is not explicitly stated that it involved the burning of Ryazan either, but it is mentioned closer in time to the first event than the Russo-Crimean War.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it is unclear which of these two events is the second one mentioned in relation to the burning of Ryazan.\n\nFinal Answer: It is unclear from the given information which event, the Russo-Crimean War or the Battle of Molodi, is the second event mentioned in relation to the burning of Ryazan.",
        "Based on the information provided in the passage, the Battle of Molodi occurred before the release of 15,000 captives by Nogais. The reason for this inference is that the Battle of Molodi is mentioned before the release of the captives in the passage.\n\nFinal Answer: The Battle of Molodi occurred before the release of 15,000 captives by Nogais.",
        "Inference: The passage mentions two significant events that occurred during different time periods. The first event was the Battle of Molodi in 1572, where an unknown outcome was recorded. The second event was the release of 15,000 captives by the Nogais in 1618 as part of a peace treaty with Moscow.\n\nBased on the context, the Battle of Molodi appears to be a military engagement between two opposing forces, while the release of captives by the Nogais suggests a diplomatic resolution to a conflict. Therefore, it is unlikely that these two events are directly related to each other.\n\nFinal Answer: The Battle of Molodi and the release of 15,000 captives by the Nogais are two separate events in Russian history. The Battle of Molodi occurred in 1572 during the Russo-Crimean War, while the release of captives took place in 1618 as part of a peace treaty between Moscow and the Nogais.",
        "Based on the information provided in the passage, the burning of Ryazan occurred in 1564, which is before the Russo-Crimean War that started in 1571.

        "Based on the information provided in the passage, the raid reached Moscow in 1591 and the suburbs of Moscow were burned in 1592. Therefore, one year passed between the raid reaching Moscow and the burning of the suburbs of Moscow.\n\nFinal Answer: One year.",
        "Based on the given text, the suburbs of Moscow were burned in the year 1592. The Nogai raids within sight of Moscow occurred during the Time of Troubles, but an exact year was not mentioned in the text. However, it is mentioned that the price of a slave at Kaffa dropped significantly during the Time of Troubles, which suggests that the raids might have occurred around the same time as the other major raids mentioned in the text. Therefore, it can be inferred that the Nogai raids within sight of Moscow likely occurred around the late 1600s, possibly in the 1610s or 1620s.\n\nTo find the exact number of years that passed between the burning of Moscow suburbs and the Nogai raids within sight of Moscow, we need to look for a specific year in the text. Unfortunately, the text does not provide an exact year for the Nogai raids within sight of Moscow during the Time of Troubles. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based on the given text alone.\n\nFinal Answer: The text does not provide enough information to determine the exact number of years that passed from the burning of Moscow suburbs until the Nogai raids within sight of Moscow.",

The passage states that \"600 Tatars and 200 Zaporozhian Cossacks raid Kozlov,\" and that \"19 were killed, and 262 were captured.\"\n\nFinal Answer: Both the Tatars and the Zaporozhian Cossacks raided Kozlov.",
        "Based on the information provided in the passage, the Tatars had approximately 600 troops when they raided Kozlov, while the Cossacks had 200 troops during the same raid. Therefore, the Tatars had about 400 more troops than the Cossacks during this particular raid.\n\nFinal Answer: The Tatars had about 400 more troops than the Cossacks when they raided Kozlov.",
        "Based on the given information, the Russo-Crimean War started before the Smolensk War. The Russo-Crimean War is mentioned as early as 1571, while the Smolensk War is mentioned as starting in 1632. Therefore, it can be inferred that the Russo-Crimean War came before the Smolensk War.\n\nFinal Answer: The Russo-Crimean War started before the Smolensk War.",
        "Based on the information provided in the passage, the last deep raid into Muscovy by the Tatars occurred in 1633. This raid was significant because it involved 30,000 Tatars crossing the Abatis and Bank lines and thousands being captured from the Oka region. The passage also mentions several smaller raids led by Nogais and Crimean nobles without the Khan's permission between 1637 and 1643. However, none of these raids are described as deep or particularly large in comparison to the 1633 raid.\n\nThe Russo-Crimean War is mentioned in the passage as occurring between 1571 and 1591. There is no indication in the passage that this war started last or that it involved any deep raids into Muscovy.\n\nThe Smolensk War is not mentioned at all in the passage. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is safe to infer that neither the Russo-Crimean War nor the Smolensk War started last. However, the passage does not provide enough information to definitively determine which war started last.\n\nFinal Answer: Neither the Russo-Crimean War nor the Smolensk War started last, according to the information provided in the passage.",

        "The passage mentions two separate events where a city or its suburbs were burned. The first event occurred in 1564 when the city of Ryazan was burned. The second event took place in 1592 when the suburbs of Moscow were burned.\n\nBased on the information provided, it appears that these two events are distinct and unrelated to each other. Therefore, the city of Ryazan was burned before the suburbs of Moscow.\n\nFinal Answer: The city of Ryazan was burned before the suburbs of Moscow.",

        "The Republic, seeing the easy gains in the East, decided to capitalize on Portugal's weakness in the Americas. In response, they established the Dutch West India Company in 1621 to take control of the sugar trade and colonize America. The Dutch invasion began in 1624 with the conquest of Salvador, but it was short-lived. The Portuguese recaptured the city in 1625, and the Dutch returned in 1630 to capture Olinda and Recife. The Dutch were unable to harvest sugar until 1635 due to Portuguese guerrilla attacks and were virtually confined to the walled perimeter of the cities. The Dutch eventually evicted the Portuguese with the help of a local landlord, but he was later captured and executed for treason. The Portuguese fought back two Dutch attacks on Bahia in 1638, but by 1641, the Dutch had captured S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, leaving them in control of northwestern Brazil between Maranh\u00e3o and Sergipe in the south.\n\nFinal Answer: The Republic reacted to the quick, simple additions in the East by establishing the Dutch West India Company to take control of the sugar trade and colonize America, and launching invasions of Brazil to capture key cities. However, their success was limited due to Portuguese resistance and guerrilla attacks.",
        "The Dutch first invaded Brazil in 1624, and they returned in 1630 to establish New Holland. Therefore, there is a difference of 6 years between the two Dutch invasions.\n\nFinal Answer: The Dutch invasion in 1624 and the return in 1630 resulted in a difference of 6 years.",
        "The Dutch were only able to harvest sugar in the walled perimeter of the cities they had established, such as Mauritsstadt (Recife), due to persistent Portuguese guerrilla attacks until they were able to evict the Portuguese with the help of a local landlord named Domingos Fernandes Calabar.\n\nFinal Answer: The only safe areas for the Dutch to harvest sugar were within the walled perimeter of the cities they had established in Brazil.",
        "The Portuguese fought back two Dutch attacks on Bahia in the year 1638. The Dutch took control of Brazil between Maranh\u00e3o and Sergipe in the south in the year 1641.\n\nSo, the Dutch control of the region occurred three years after the last recorded Portuguese defense against their invasion.\n\nFinal Answer: Three years.",
        "The Dutch returned to Brazil 7 years after their initial defeat, in 1630. However, they were unable to establish a stable presence until much later, around 1635, when they were able to evict the Portuguese with the help of a local landlord named Domingos Fernandes Calabar.\n\nFinal Answer: The Dutch returned to Brazil 15 years after their initial defeat, in 1635.

        "Inference: Frank Gore had a significant number of rushing yards in the first half, setting a franchise record. His touchdown run accounted for a large portion of those yards. However, the passage mentions the specific yardage for that touchdown run (61 yards). Therefore, we can infer that the remaining yards Gore had in the first half on runs other than his touchdown run must be subtracted from the total yardage he gained in the first half.\n\nFinal Answer: The passage states that Frank Gore had 148 yards rushing in the first half. His touchdown run accounted for 61 yards, so we can find the number of yards he had on runs other than his touchdown run by subtracting the yardage of his touchdown run from his total yardage in the first half.
