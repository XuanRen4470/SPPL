        "The center of the circle that is externally tangent to $w_2$ and internally tangent to $w_1$ is $(5,12)$.  Thus, the line $y=ax$ must have slope $a=\\frac{12}{5}$.

Since the base is a $6\\times 8$ rectangle, the area of the base is $B=48$. The height of the pyramid is the length of the altitude from the apex to the center of the base, which we can find using the Pythagorean Theorem. Let $h$ be the height of the pyramid, and let $x$ be the length of the edge of the square face of the pyramid. Then we have that $x^2+h^2=13^2$, so $x^2+h^2=169$.

        "Let the common difference be d. The sum of the measures of the angles of the polygon is (18-2) * 180 = 2880. This can be written as 18/2 * (a1 + an), where a1 is the smallest angle and an is the largest angle. This simplifies to 9 * (a1 + a1 + 17d). This is equal to 2880, so we can solve for a1. We can start by dividing both sides by 9, which gives us a1 + a1 + 17d = 320. Then we can subtract a1 from both sides, which gives us a1 + 17d = 320 - a1. This is equal to 2a1 + 17d = 320. Subtracting 2a1 from both sides gives us 17d = 320 - 2a1. We can divide both sides by 17, which gives us d = 320/17 - a1/17. We know that d is the difference between consecutive terms, so we can write the terms of the sequence as a1, a1+d, a1+2d,..., a1+16d, a1+17d. We know that a1 is the smallest angle, so we know that a1+d is the second smallest angle. The sum of the measures of these two angles is a1 + (a1+d) = 180, so we can write a1 + a1+d = 180. This is equal to 2a1 + d = 180. We can substitute our expression for d into this equation, which gives us 2a1 + (320/17 - a1/17) = 180. We can multiply both sides by 17, which gives us 34a1 + 320 - a1 = 3060. We can subtract 320 from both sides, which gives us 34a1 - a1 = 2740. This is equal to 33a1 = 2740.

        "Let's break it down step by step!\n\nThe original container holds 2 gallons. When all its dimensions are tripled, the volume of the container becomes 3^3 = 27 times larger.\n\nSince the volume of the original container is 2 gallons, the volume of the new container is:\n\n2 gallons \u00d7 27 = 54 gallons\n\nFinal Answer: 54"
