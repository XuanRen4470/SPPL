This property allows us to combine the exponents by adding them together.\n\nFirst, we add the exponents:\n\\[0.5 + 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.1 + 0.9.\\]\n\nLet's add these step by step:\n\\[0.5 + 0.3 = 0.8,\\]\n\\[0.8 + 0.2 = 1.0,\\]\n\\[1.0 + 0.1 = 1.1,\\]\n\\[1.1 + 0.9 = 2.0.\\]\n\nSo, the sum of the exponents is 2. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n\\[10^{2}.\\]\n\nWe know that \\(10^2 = 100\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\\boxed{100}.\\]",

        "To determine the values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) for the quadratic function \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\), we need to analyze the given graph. The graph shows a parabola that opens upwards, indicating that \\(a > 0\\). The vertex form of the quadratic function can help us identify the vertex and the axis of symmetry.\n\nFrom the graph, we can see that the vertex of the parabola is at \\((-1, -2)\\). The vertex form of a quadratic function is given by:\n\\[ y = a(x - h)^2 + k \\]\nwhere \\((h, k)\\) is the vertex. Substituting the vertex \\((-1, -2)\\) into the vertex form, we get:\n\\[ y = a(x + 1)^2 - 2 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the value of \\(a\\). We can use another point on the graph to determine \\(a\\). The graph passes through the point \\((0, -1)\\). Substituting \\(x = 0\\) and \\(y = -1\\) into the vertex form equation, we get:\n\\[ -1 = a(0 + 1)^2 - 2 \\]\n\\[ -1 = a - 2 \\]\n\\[ a = 1 \\]\n\nNow that we have \\(a = 1\\), the equation of the parabola is:\n\\[ y = (x + 1)^2 - 2 \\]\n\nWe can expand this equation to the standard form \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\):\n\\[ y = (x + 1)^2 - 2 \\]\n\\[ y = x^2 + 2x + 1 - 2 \\]\n\\[ y = x^2 + 2x - 1 \\]\n\nFrom this, we can identify the coefficients:\n\\[ a = 1, \\quad b = 2, \\quad c = -1 \\]\n\nWe need to find \\(a - b + c\\):\n\\[ a - b + c = 1 - 2 - 1 = -2 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-2}\n\\]",
        "To calculate Karen's average speed, we first need to determine the total time she spent driving. \n\nKaren started driving at 9:40 a.m. and finished at 1:20 p.m. \n\nLet's break down the time:\n- From 9:40 a.m. to 12:40 p.m. is 3 hours.\n- From 12:40 p.m. to 1:20 p.m. is 40 minutes.\n\nSo, the total time is 3 hours and 40 minutes. \n\nNext, we convert 40 minutes into hours:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{40}{60} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total driving time in hours is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hours} + \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ hours} = 3 + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{9}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{11}{3} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we use the formula for average speed:\n\\[ \\text{Average speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Total time}} \\]\n\nGiven the total distance is 165 miles and the total time is \\(\\frac{11}{3}\\) hours, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Average speed} = \\frac{165 \\text{ miles}}{\\frac{11}{3} \\text{ hours}} = 165 \\times \\frac{3}{11} \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nSimplify the multiplication:\n\\[ 165 \\times \\frac{3}{11} = 15 \\times 3 = 45 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nFinal Answer: 45",

Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{-(-5) \\pm \\sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot (-4)}}{2 \\cdot 2} \\]\n\nSimplifying inside the square root and the rest of the expression, we have:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 + 32}}{4} \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{57}}{4} \\]\n\nThe roots of the equation are in the form \\(x = \\frac{m \\pm \\sqrt{n}}{p}\\), where \\(m = 5\\), \\(n = 57\\), and \\(p = 4\\). The greatest common divisor of 5, 57, and 4 is 1, so the values are in the simplest form. Therefore, the value of \\(n\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{57} \\]",
