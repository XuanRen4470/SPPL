Corn is also relatively heavy for its volume.\n\n2. **Structure of a Silo**: A silo is a vertical cylindrical structure designed to store large quantities of grain. It typically has a smooth, vertical surface, which helps the grain pack tightly.\n\n3. **Mechanism of Entrapment**: When a person enters a pile of corn, the grain can shift and collapse, burying the person. This is due to the granular nature of the corn and the weight of the corn above the person.\n\nGiven these factors, a person can indeed sink or be buried in a corn silo due to the weight and granular properties of the corn. The likelihood of sinking increases as more corn is added above the person.\n\nFinal Answer: True",

        "To infer whether a money order is the same as a postal order, let's compare the definitions and characteristics of both:\n\n1. **Postal Order**: It is a financial instrument purchased at a post office and payable at another post office to the named recipient. It involves a small fee called poundage paid by the purchaser. It is not legal tender but a type of promissory note similar to a cheque.\n\n2. **Money Order**: Generally, a money order is a payment order issued by a financial institution or a post office, allowing the holder to receive a specified amount of money. It is also used to send money through the mail and often involves a small fee. It is typically not legal tender but a form of secured payment.\n\nFrom the definitions, we can see that both involve purchasing a financial instrument to send money through the mail, and both typically involve a small fee and are not legal tender. However, the key difference lies in the place of issuance: postal orders are specifically issued by post offices, while money orders can be issued by financial institutions as well.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that while there are similarities, they are not exactly the same.\n\nFinal Answer: False",

The context states that Puerto Rico has independent tax-levying authority by provisions of 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 734 of the United States code.\n2. This implies that Puerto Rico can set its own tax laws and systems.\n3. However, it does not explicitly state that Puerto Rico citizens do not pay federal taxes.\n\nAdditional context:\n- U.S. citizens and resident aliens, regardless of where they live, are generally required to pay federal income taxes on their worldwide income.\n- Puerto Rico residents are U.S. citizens and thus subject to federal tax laws.\n\nGiven this, Puerto Rico residents are required to pay federal taxes on their income, even though they may also be subject to local taxes set by Puerto Rico.\n\nFinal Answer: True",

This cycle suggests that the cow is not continuously pregnant.\n\n2. **Drying Off Period**: The cow is \"dried off\" for about 60 days before calving again. This period is a time when the cow is not producing milk and is preparing for the next calving.\n\n3. **Milk Production Timing**: The peak milk production occurs around 40 to 60 days after calving, and production declines steadily afterwards until milking is stopped. This indicates that milk production is linked to the lactation period following calving, not to the pregnancy itself.\n\n4. **Non-Continuous Pregnancy**: The information does not suggest that cows need to be continuously pregnant to produce milk. Instead, they produce milk during the lactation period following calving.\n\nBased on these points, cows do not need to stay pregnant to produce milk. They produce milk primarily during the lactation period following calving.\n\nFinal Answer: False",

The context mentions that bay leaves are not sold for culinary use due to the belief that they are poisonous, although this belief is false.\n2. It states that bay leaves may be eaten without toxic effect.\n3. However, the text notes that bay leaves remain stiff even after thorough cooking and can pose a risk of harming the digestive tract or causing choking if swallowed whole or in large pieces.\n4. There have been cases of intestinal perforations caused by swallowing bay leaves.\n5. Therefore, unless the leaves have been ground, they should be removed from the food before serving to avoid the risk of a surgical emergency.\n\nFrom these points, it is clear that while bay leaves are not poisonous and can be eaten, they should be removed from food after cooking to avoid potential harm due to their stiffness and the risk of choking or intestinal perforation.\n\nFinal Answer: False",

The context lists Delaware as one of the states that allow the sale and use of non-aerial and non-explosive fireworks, also known as \"safe and sane\" fireworks, which include novelties, fountains, and sparklers.\n\nSince Delaware is included in this list, it implies that the use of these types of fireworks is legal within the state. However, the context does not explicitly mention the legality of shooting all types of fireworks, including potentially more powerful or aerial fireworks.\n\nTo provide a final answer, we need to consider that the context only confirms the legality of non-aerial and non-explosive fireworks. Without additional information, we cannot assume that all types of fireworks are legal to shoot in Delaware.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "Inference: Based on the given context, it was announced that ABC had ordered a 10-episode spin-off of an existing show, tentatively titled \"The Conners,\" and it was set to premiere on October 16, 2018. This spin-off would involve most of the original cast members, with some new additions.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "Inference: Universal life insurance policies have a cash value because under the terms of the policy, the excess of premium payments above the current cost of insurance is credited to the cash value of the policy. The policy also accrues interest and may be debited for various charges, all of which contribute to the cash value.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "Based on the information provided, the key points are:\n\n1. **8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1403** retroactively conferred citizenship on individuals born in the Panama Canal Zone on or after February 26, 1904, and on individuals born in the Republic of Panama on or after that date who had at least one U.S. citizen parent employed by the U.S. government or the Panama Railway Company.\n2. **8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401** is another section that deals with natural-born citizenship.\n3. Judge William Alsup stated that it is \"highly probable\" that McCain is a natural-born citizen from birth by virtue of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401, although he acknowledged the possibility of retroactive citizenship through 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1403.\n\nThe inference here is that being born on a military base, which is part of a U.S. territory or military installation, can potentially confer U.S. citizenship, either from birth or retroactively, depending on the specific circumstances and laws in place.\n\n**Final Answer: True**",
        "To checkmate with two bishops and a king, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. **Control of the Board**: Bishops are long-range pieces that can control the entire board. However, they are restricted to squares of the same color. For checkmate, the bishops must coordinate to control key squares, often focusing on the opponent's king.\n\n2. **King's Position**: The king must be confined to a small area, typically a 2x3 or 3x3 square, where it can be checked repeatedly until it is forced into a position where it cannot escape.\n\n3. **Bishops' Coordination**: The bishops need to work together to block all escape routes for the opponent's king, often by controlling the central squares and forcing the king into a corner.\n\nGiven these principles, it is indeed possible to checkmate with two bishops and a king. The bishops can work together to control the board and confine the opponent's king, eventually forcing it into a checkmate position.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "Inference: Based on the given context, a person who is 18 years old can get a tattoo in most states because the statutory laws in all 50 states and the District of Columbia require the recipient to be 18 years of age or older. This means that an 18-year-old is generally considered old enough to receive a tattoo without additional parental permission.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "Based on the context provided, there are indeed two versions of Ren & Stimpy. The original version aired on Nickelodeon and was aimed at children, while the \"Adult Party Cartoon\" version, which is noted for its more mature and vulgar content, was created for a different audience and aired on a different network.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "Inference: The octet rule primarily applies to main-group elements, particularly those in the second and third periods, such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and the halogens. It is less applicable to transition metals and other elements that do not typically achieve a full outer shell of eight electrons through typical chemical bonding. \n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "To determine if you have to pay to be on Judge Judy, let's analyze the information provided:\n\n1. **Appearance Fee:** The text mentions that litigants receive an appearance fee, which varies between $100, $250, and $500. This suggests that there is a payment involved, but it is not a fixed amount and can vary.\n\n2. **Daily Payment:** Litigants are paid $35 a day by the show, and their stay lasts for two or three days. This is an additional form of compensation.\n\n3. **Expenses Covered:** The show covers airfare, hotel expenses, and other travel costs, treating the experience as an all-expense-paid vacation.\n\n4. **Court Case Duration:** The actual court case, excluding deleted footage, lasts from twelve to forty-five minutes, and Sheindlin sees a half-page complaint and defense response before taping.\n\nGiven these points, the litigants do receive some form of compensation (appearance fee and daily payment) for participating in the show. However, the question of whether you have to pay to be on Judge Judy is more about the initial cost of applying or being selected for the show rather than the compensation received once selected.\n\nBased on the provided information, it does not explicitly state that there is an initial fee for applying or being selected to appear on the show. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the cost of being on Judge Judy is covered by the show once selected.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "In the context provided, when the ball is dead, no runners may advance beyond the bases they are entitled to. Therefore, a runner cannot advance on a dead ball.\n\nFinal Answer: False",

        "Based on the context provided, the film \"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald\" is explicitly mentioned as the sequel to \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" (2016). Therefore, there is indeed a sequel to \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.\"\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "Based on the context provided, it is possible to remove venom glands from a snake through a surgical procedure. The context mentions that such procedures have been used to make venomous snakes safer for pet ownership or public demonstrations. However, it also notes that these procedures can be considered illegal and unethical, and that the effectiveness of such procedures can be uncertain due to potential regrowth of the duct or gland.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "Inference: Based on the provided context, Fairmont Hotels & Resorts is described as a chain of luxury hotels. It is owned by AccorHotels and operates 75 properties in 24 countries. This information strongly suggests that Fairmont Hotels & Resorts is indeed part of a hotel chain.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "Based on the context provided, it mentions that the soundtrack for \"A Star Is Born\" was performed by Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga. This implies that Bradley Cooper did sing in the film's soundtrack.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "Inference: According to the given context, a triangle's angles must sum to 180\u00b0. An obtuse angle is defined as an angle greater than 90\u00b0. If a triangle were to have more than one obtuse angle, the sum of just those two angles would exceed 180\u00b0, which is impossible for a triangle. Therefore, a triangle cannot have more than one obtuse angle.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "To determine if One World Trade Center is taller than the Empire State Building, we need to compare their heights.\n\n- One World Trade Center rises to 1,776 feet (541 m).\n- The Empire State Building, without its antenna, rises to 1,250 feet (381 m). With its antenna, it reaches 1,454 feet (443 m).\n\nComparing these heights, 1,776 feet is greater than 1,454 feet.\n\nFinal Answer: True",

They were absent from the finals after 1950 until 1990 but have been a regular participant in the World Cup since then, except for the 2018 competition where they failed to qualify.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "In running, there is a phase where both feet are above the ground simultaneously, which is known as the aerial phase. This is a characteristic feature that distinguishes running from walking, where at least one foot is always in contact with the ground.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "To infer whether Charlie from \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" is still alive, we need to consider the information provided and make reasonable assumptions based on it.\n\n1. **Peter Gardner Ostrum's Age**: Peter Gardner Ostrum was born on November 1, 1957. This means he is currently 65 years old (as of 2023).\n\n2. **Charlie Bucket's Age in the Film**: In the 1971 film \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory,\" Charlie Bucket was a young boy, likely around 12 years old. This means that in the timeline of the film, Charlie would be older than 65 years now.\n\n3. **Assumption of Real-World Events**: Given that Peter Gardner Ostrum is the actor who played Charlie Bucket and the film is based on a character from a book series, it is reasonable to assume that the character Charlie Bucket is a real person who lived through the events of the book and the film.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since Peter Gardner Ostrum is alive and the character is based on a real person, it is reasonable to infer that Charlie Bucket, the character, is also still alive.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "Based on the given context, the Australian Constitution does not have a complete separation of powers. Instead, there is a system of checks and balances, and the Westminster system, which requires ministers (executive) to sit in Parliament (legislative), is in place to adhere to the concept of Responsible Government.\n\nFinal Answer: False"
