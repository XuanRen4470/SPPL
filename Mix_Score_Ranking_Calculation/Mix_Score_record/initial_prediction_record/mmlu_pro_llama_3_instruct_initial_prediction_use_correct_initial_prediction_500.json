        "Let's analyze the options.\n\nA meteor shower occurs when small particles from space enter the Earth's atmosphere and burn up, producing a bright streak of light in the sky. The particles must be small enough to be completely vaporized by the friction with the atmosphere, otherwise they would survive their passage through the atmosphere and land on the Earth's surface.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the particles causing meteor showers must be small and originate from a source outside the Earth's atmosphere. The correct option should describe a scenario where these particles are produced and then enter the Earth's atmosphere, causing the meteor shower.\n\nNow, let's examine the options:\n\n* Options A, H, and J describe the disintegration of large meteorites, asteroids, or comet nuclei, which is a possible source of small particles.\n* Options B and J describe the gradual disintegration of asteroids or comet nuclei, which could produce small particles along their orbital paths.\n* Options C and F describe the ejection of particles from the surface of the moon or a comet, respectively, which could also produce small particles that enter the Earth's atmosphere.\n* Options D, G, and I are unlikely to be correct, as they describe the disintegration of planets, stars, or satellites, which would not produce small particles that enter the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nBased on our analysis, the correct option is:\n\nFinal Answer: J",
        "Let's break down the greenhouse effect:\n\nThe greenhouse effect occurs when certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide and methane, trap heat from the Sun. This heat is initially absorbed by the Earth's surface and atmosphere, causing them to warm up. The trapped heat is then re-emitted by the atmosphere in the form of infrared radiation. However, the greenhouse gases absorb this infrared radiation, preventing it from escaping into space and keeping the Earth warm.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n* Options (A), (E), and (H) mention the absorption of infrared light from the Sun, which is incorrect. The Sun emits visible and ultraviolet light, not infrared light.\n* Options (B), (F), and (I) mention the absorption of ultraviolet or visible light, which is also incorrect. The greenhouse effect is caused by the absorption of infrared radiation, not ultraviolet or visible light.\n* Options (C), (G), and (J) mention the transmission of visible light, which is correct. Visible light is absorbed by the Earth's surface and atmosphere, causing them to warm up.\n* Options (D) and (F) mention the absorption of infrared radiation, which is correct. The greenhouse gases absorb the infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface and atmosphere, trapping the heat near the surface.\n\nBased on our analysis, the correct option is:\n\nFinal Answer: F",

        "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. The string of freight cars weighs 200 tons. We need to convert this to a more meaningful unit. There are 2000 pounds in a ton, so the total weight is:\n\n200 tons x 2000 pounds/ton = 400,000 pounds\n\n2. The coefficient of rolling friction is 0.005. This means that for every 100 pounds of force applied to the cars, 0.5 pounds will be lost due to friction. We can write this as:\n\nForce lost due to friction = 0.005 x 400,000 pounds = 2,000 pounds\n\n3. The freight engine has a power output of 400 horsepower. We need to convert this to a more meaningful unit. There are 746 watts in a horsepower, so the total power output is:\n\n400 horsepower x 746 watts/horsepower = 298,400 watts\n\n4. Since the engine is pulling the cars, we need to convert the power output to a force. We can do this by dividing the power output by the speed at which the cars are moving. Let's call this speed \"v\" for now.\n\nForce = Power / Speed\n= 298,400 watts / v\n\n5. We know that the force applied to the cars is equal to the weight of the cars minus the force lost due to friction.

Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nv = 0 + (5 m/s^2) \u00d7 t\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nv = 5t m/s\n\nNow we can find the time (t) it takes to cover a distance of 200 m. We can use the equation:\n\nd = ut + (1/2)at^2\n\nwhere d is the distance, u is the initial velocity, t is the time, and a is the acceleration. Since the car starts from rest, the initial velocity (u) is 0 m/s.

        "Let's break it down!\n\nThe statement says that hot sand cools off faster at night than does vegetation. This suggests that sand has a lower specific heat capacity than vegetation.\n\nSpecific heat capacity is the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of a substance by 1 degree Celsius. Substances with a lower specific heat capacity require less heat energy to change their temperature, which means they cool off faster.\n\nVegetation, being a living organism, has a relatively high specific heat capacity due to its high water content and complex biological structure. Sand, on the other hand, is a dry and simple substance with a low specific heat capacity.\n\nTherefore, it is reasonable to conclude that sand's specific heat capacity is lower compared to vegetation.\n\nFinal Answer: (C) \"lower\"",

We can use these values to set up a proportion:\n\n(P_Hyperion / P_Titan)^2 = (r_Hyperion / r_Titan)^3\n\nWe can plug in the given values:\n\n(P_Hyperion / 15.95)^2 = (1.48x10^9 / 1.22x10^9)^3\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nP_Hyperion = \u221a((1.48x10^9 / 1.22x10^9)^3 * 15.95^2)\n\nP_Hyperion \u2248 21.3 days\n\nFinal Answer: (B)",

This means that the tape is calibrated for a length of 50.000 m at a temperature of 20\u00b0C.\n2. When the tape is used at a temperature of 35\u00b0C, it expands due to thermal expansion. The tape's length increases by an amount equal to the expansion caused by the temperature change.\n3. The surveyor reads a value of 35.794 m on the tape. This is the length of the tape as measured at a temperature of 35\u00b0C.\n\nTo find the actual distance, we need to account for the thermal expansion. Since the tape is made of steel, its thermal expansion coefficient is approximately 11.7 x 10^-6 per degree Celsius.\n\nLet's calculate the expansion caused by the temperature change:\n\n\u0394T = 35\u00b0C - 20\u00b0C = 15\u00b0C\nExpansion = \u0394T x thermal expansion coefficient = 15\u00b0C x 11.7 x 10^-6 = 0.001755 m\n\nThe actual distance is the measured length plus the expansion:\n\nActual distance = 35.794 m + 0.001755 m = 35.795 m\n\nComparing this value to the options, we can see that the closest match is:\n\nFinal Answer: (E) 35.8",

        "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The shade is falling from the ceiling light, which is 9 ft above the floor. This means the shade has a initial velocity of 0 (since it's not moving initially) and an initial height of 9 ft.\n2. The elevator is descending with an acceleration of 5 ft/s^2. This means the elevator is gaining speed at a rate of 5 ft/s^2. However, this acceleration doesn't affect the shade's motion until it hits the floor.\n3. Since the shade is under the sole influence of gravity (since the elevator's acceleration doesn't affect it until it hits the floor), its acceleration is 9.8 ft/s^2 (approximately).\n4. The passenger sees the shade at the instant it starts falling, which means the shade has been falling for 0 seconds at that point.\n5. The passenger wants to know how long he has to get his foot out of the way. This means we need to find the time it takes for the shade to travel the distance from the floor to the passenger's foot (which is 9 ft).\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the equation of motion:\n\nv^2 = v0^2 + 2as\n\nwhere v is the final velocity (0, since the shade will eventually come to rest), v0 is the initial velocity (0), a is the acceleration (9.8 ft/s^2), and s is the distance (9 ft).\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for time, we get:\n\nt = sqrt(2s/a)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nt = sqrt(2*9/9.8) \u2248 0.82 s\n\nFinal Answer: I",

The magnification of the planetary object is 300 diameters. This means that the angular diameter of the object as seen through the eyepiece is 1/300th of its angular diameter as seen through the telescope.\n3. The angular diameter of the object as seen through the telescope is equal to the angular diameter of the object divided by the magnification (1/300). Since the focal length of the telescope is 300 inches, the angular diameter of the object as seen through the telescope is:\n\nAngular diameter = 1 / (300 \u00d7 300) radians\n\n4. The angular diameter of the object as seen through the eyepiece is 1/300th of this value. To find the angular diameter of the object as seen through the eyepiece, we multiply the angular diameter as seen through the telescope by 1/300:\n\nAngular diameter (eyepiece) = (1 / (300 \u00d7 300)) \u00d7 1/300 radians\n\n5. The focal length of the eyepiece can be found using the formula:\n\nFocal length (eyepiece) = Focal length (telescope) / Magnification\n\nFocal length (eyepiece) = 300 inches / 300\n\nFocal length (eyepiece) = 1 inch\n\nFinal Answer: (H)",

We know that the cores of terrestrial planets are made up of iron and nickel, which are metals. This suggests that the correct answer is related to the formation and composition of the planets.\n\nOption (C) seems plausible, as it suggests that metals sank to the center of the planet during a time when the interiors were molten throughout. This is consistent with the idea that the Earth's core is made up of iron and nickel, which are dense and would have sunk to the center of the planet as it cooled.\n\nOption (D) also seems possible, as it suggests that metals are more resistant to heat and pressure, which would allow them to survive at the core while other materials melted away. This is consistent with the idea that the core of the Earth is extremely hot and pressurized, and that metals are able to withstand these conditions.\n\nHowever, option (C) is a more straightforward and intuitive explanation, and it is also supported by scientific evidence. For example, scientists have found that the Earth's core is composed of iron and nickel, and that these metals are present in the form of molten droplets.\n\nFinal Answer: C",

The surface temperature of the Sun is directly related to its energy output, which is measured by its luminosity.\n\nThe luminosity of the Sun is about 3.8 x 10^26 watts. This is a very high energy output, which means that the surface temperature of the Sun must be very high to produce this amount of energy.\n\nThe surface temperature of the Sun is also directly related to its color. The surface temperature of the Sun is so high that it emits most of its energy in the form of ultraviolet and X-rays, which are not visible to the human eye. However, the temperature of the Sun's surface is also high enough to emit a significant amount of visible light, which is why we can see it.\n\nBased on these facts, we can infer that the surface temperature of the Sun is likely to be very high, but not as high as the highest option (D) 14000 K.

We need to find the energy of the photon.\n\nThe energy of a photon (E) is related to its frequency (f) by the formula:\n\nE = hf\n\nwhere h is Planck's constant, approximately equal to 6.63 \u00d7 10^-34 J s (joule-seconds).\n\nWe can plug in the given frequency into the formula:\n\nE = hf\n= (6.63 \u00d7 10^-34 J s) \u00d7 (6 \u00d7 10^14 vps)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the product:\n\n(6.63 \u00d7 10^-34 J s) \u00d7 (6 \u00d7 10^14 vps) = 3.98 \u00d7 10^-19 J\n\nSo, the energy of the photon is approximately 3.98 \u00d7 10^-19 joules.\n\nFinal Answer: E",
        "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nWe know that the speed of longitudinal and transverse waves along a wire is given by:\n\nv_long = sqrt(T/\u03c1)\n\nv_trans = sqrt(T/\u03bc)\n\nwhere T is the tension, \u03c1 is the density, and \u03bc is the shear modulus.\n\nSince we want the speed of longitudinal and transverse waves to be the same, we can set v_long = v_trans and solve for T.\n\nv_long = v_trans\n\n\u221a(T/\u03c1) = \u221a(T/\u03bc)\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\nT/\u03c1 = T/\u03bc\n\n\u03c1 = \u03bc\n\nThis means that the density of the wire is equal to the shear modulus. However, this is not possible, as density and shear modulus are two different physical properties that cannot be equal.\n\nTherefore, the situation is physically unrealizable.\n\nFinal Answer: (I)",

Mach Number is a ratio of an object's speed to the speed of sound.

        "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The man jumps from a height of 5 m, which means he has an initial potential energy. When he hits the water, this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.\n2. The man's velocity is reduced to zero by the water in 0.4 seconds. This means the water is exerting a force on the man to slow him down.\n3. Since the man's velocity is reduced to zero, the force exerted by the water must be equal to the man's initial momentum divided by the time it takes to reduce the velocity to zero.\n\nLet's calculate the man's initial momentum:\n\nInitial velocity = \u221a(2gh) = \u221a(2 \u00d7 9.8 m/s\u00b2 \u00d7 5 m) = approximately 14.14 m/s\n\nInitial momentum = mass \u00d7 initial velocity = 100 kg \u00d7 14.14 m/s \u2248 1414 kg m/s\n\n4. Now, we can calculate the force exerted by the water:\n\nForce = initial momentum / time = 1414 kg m/s / 0.4 s \u2248 3535 N\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the average force, not the maximum force. Since the force is decreasing as the man's velocity decreases, we need to find the average force over the 0.4-second period.\n\nAverage force = total force / time = 3535 N / 0.4 s \u2248 8841.25 N\n\nSince the force is acting in the opposite direction of the man's motion, we need to take the negative sign:\n\nAverage force = -8841.25 N\n\nNow, let's compare this value with the options:\n\nFinal Answer: (E) - 3480 N",
        "Let's analyze the situation and the options.\n\nThe period of the pendulum is 0.4 s, which means it takes 0.4 s for the ball to complete one oscillation. We want to know which change would decrease the period.\n\nThe period of a pendulum is directly proportional to the square root of its length. This means that if we decrease the length of the string, the period would decrease.\n\nThe options that suggest decreasing the length of the string are:\n\n* (G): \"Decreasing the length of the string\"\n* (E): \"Increasing the length of the string\" (which is incorrect, since increasing the length would increase the period)\n\nThe other options don't directly affect the period of the pendulum. For example, releasing the string from a higher or lower point would change the initial angle of the pendulum, but not its period. Changing the angle of the string or the mass of the ball would also not directly affect the period.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: (G)",

Since they are perpendicular, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the resultant groundspeed.\n\nGroundspeed = \u221a(airspeed^2 + crosswind^2)\n= \u221a(40^2 + 30^2)\n= \u221a(1600 + 900)\n= \u221a2500\n\u2248 50 km/h\n\nFinal Answer: C",
        "Let's analyze the situation. We have a circuit with two lamps in parallel, and we know the current in one lamp is 2 A. Since the lamps are in parallel, they have the same voltage across them. The total current drawn from the circuit is the sum of the currents in each lamp.\n\nLet's say the current in the second lamp is x A. Since the total current is the sum of the currents, we can set up the equation:\n\n2 A + x A = Total Current\n\nSince the total current is the same as the voltage divided by the total resistance (which is the same as the sum of the resistances of the two lamps), we can also write:\n\n2 A + x A = V / (R1 + R2)\n\nwhere V is the voltage and R1 and R2 are the resistances of the two lamps.\n\nWe are not given any information about the resistances or the voltage, so we cannot determine the exact value of x.
