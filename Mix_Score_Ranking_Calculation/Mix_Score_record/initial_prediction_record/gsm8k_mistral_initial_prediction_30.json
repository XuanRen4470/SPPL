        "Natalia sold 48 clips in April. In May, she sold half as many, which is 48 / 2 = 24 clips.\n\nSo, Natalia sold a total of 48 (April) + 24 (May) = 72 clips in April and May.\n\nFinal Answer: 72 clips",
        "First, we need to convert the 50 minutes of babysitting into hours. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n\n50 minutes = 50 / 60 = 0.8333 hours\n\nNext, we can calculate how much Weng earned by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours worked:\n\nEarnings = Hourly rate * Hours worked\nFinal Answer: $12/hour * 0.8333 hours = $10.00\n\nSo, Weng earned $10.00 for babysitting for 50 minutes.",
        "Betty's parents gave her $15, and her grandparents gave her twice that amount. So, her grandparents gave her $15 * 2 = $30.\n\nBetty has received a total of $15 (from her parents) + $30 (from her grandparents) = $45.\n\nThe wallet costs $100, so Betty still needs $100 - $45 = $55 to buy the wallet.\n\nFinal Answer: $55",

        "Let's denote the number of purple flowers as x. Then, according to the problem, there are 10 yellow flowers and 80% more of them in purple, so there are 10 * 1.8 = 18 purple flowers. We know that there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow ones, so there are x = 18 * 1.5 = 27 purple flowers.\n\nThe problem states that there are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers combined. Let's find the number of yellow and purple flowers together:\n\nYellow flowers = 10\nPurple flowers = 27\n\nTogether they make 10 + 27 = 37 flowers. The number of green flowers is 25% of this number, so there are 37 * 0.25 = 9.25. Since we cannot have a fraction of a flower, we'll round up to the next whole number: 10 green flowers.\n\nFinal Answer: 37 (yellow and purple) + 27 (purple) + 10 (green) = 74 flowers in Mark's garden.",

So the weight of jelly beans and brownies together is 2 pounds * 3 = 6 pounds.\n\nNext, Ken added another 2 pounds of jelly beans, so the total weight is 6 pounds + 2 pounds = 8 pounds.\n\nFinally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again. So the final weight of the box of goodies is 8 pounds * 2 = 16 pounds.\n\nFinal Answer: 16 pounds.",
        "To find the cost of the shoes, we need to determine how much Alexis spent on all the other items and then subtract that amount from her total budget.\n\nTotal spent: $30 (shirt) + $46 (pants) + $38 (coat) + $11 (socks) + $18 (belt) = $133\n\nCost of shoes: $200 (total budget) - $133 (total spent on other items) = $67\n\nFinal Answer: $67. (This means Alexis spent $67 on the shoes, but since the question states that she lost the receipt for the shoes, it's not possible to know the exact price.)",
        "To calculate Tina's earnings for working 10 hours a day for 5 days, we first need to find her earnings for a regular 8-hour shift and her overtime earnings.\n\nRegular hours earnings = Hourly wage * Hours worked\n                                 = $18.00 * 8\n                                 = $144.00\n\nOvertime hours = Total hours worked - Regular hours\n                      = 10 hours - 8 hours\n                      = 2 hours\n\nOvertime earnings = Regular hours earnings * (1 + Overtime rate)\n                          = $144.00 * (1 + 0.5)\n                          = $144.00 * 1.5\n                          = $216.00\n\nNow, let's find her total earnings for 5 working days:\n\nTotal earnings = Regular hours earnings * Number of days + Overtime earnings * Number of overtime days\n                     = $144.00 * 5 + $216.00 * 5\n                     = $720.00 + $1,080.00\n                     = $1,780.00\n\nFinal Answer: $1,780.00",

Solving for x, we get x = 120.51 (approximately).

        "To find out how many driveways Tobias shoveled, we first need to determine how much money he earned from mowing lawns and shoveling driveways.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how much he earned from mowing lawns:\nMoney earned from mowing lawns = Number of lawns mowed * Money per lawn\n= 4 * $15\n= $60\n\nNow, let's calculate how much he earned from shoveling driveways. We know that he had $15 in change after buying the shoes, and he had already earned $60 from mowing lawns. So, the money he earned from shoveling driveways is:\nMoney earned from shoveling driveways = $15\n\nSince he charges $7 per driveway, we can now find out how many driveways he shoveled:\nNumber of driveways shoveled = Money earned from shoveling driveways / Money per driveway\n= $15 / $7\n= 2.14 (approximately)\n\nSince Tobias can't shovel a fraction of a driveway, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he shoveled 2 driveways.\n\nFinal Answer: Tobias shoveled 2 driveways.",
        "Let's denote the number of coconut trees as x. We know that x = 0.5 * number of mango trees * 60 (since there are 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees).\n\nSo, x = 0.5 * 60 * number of mango trees\n\nNow, let's solve for the number of mango trees:\n\nnumber of mango trees = x / (0.5 * 60)\nnumber of mango trees = x / 30\n\nSubstitute x back in:\n\nnumber of mango trees = (0.5 * 60 * number of mango trees) / 30\n\nTo simplify this equation, we can cross-multiply:\n\nnumber of mango trees * 30 = 0.5 * 60 * number of mango trees\n\nDividing both sides by number of mango trees:\n\n30 = 0.5 * 60\n30 = 30 * 0.5 * 2\n30 = 30 * 1 * 2 * 0.5\n\nNow, let's find the number of coconut trees:\n\nnumber of coconut trees = 0.5 * 60 * number of mango trees\nnumber of coconut trees = 0.5 * 60 * (30)\nnumber of coconut trees = 1800\n\nAdding the number of mango and coconut trees:\n\nTotal number of trees = number of mango trees + number of coconut trees\nTotal number of trees = 30 + 1800\n\nFinal Answer: 1833 trees.",

        "First, let's find out how much profit James makes per movie sold. He sells each movie for 2.5 times the production cost: $2000 * 2.5 = $5000. The production cost per movie is $2000, and the cost to make each DVD is $6. Since there is one movie on each DVD, the cost to make each movie is $2000 + $6 = $2006. So the profit per movie is $5000 - $2006 = $2994.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many movies he sells in total in 20 weeks. He sells 500 movies a day for 5 days a week, so he sells 500 * 5 = 2500 movies a week. In 20 weeks, he sells 2500 * 20 = 50,000 movies.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the total profit by multiplying the profit per movie by the total number of movies sold: $2994 * 50,000 = $149,700,000.\n\nFinal Answer: $149,700,000",

        "Let's first find out how many pink hard hats are left after Carl and John took some away. Carl took 4 pink hard hats, so there are 22 pink hard hats left. John took 6 pink hard hats, so there are now 16 pink hard hats in the truck.\n\nJohn took twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats he removed. So, John took away 6 * 2 = 12 green hard hats.\n\nNow, we have 26 (initial pink hard hats) - 4 (Carl took) - 16 (John took) = 6 pink hard hats remaining.\n\nThere were initially 15 green hard hats. After John took 12 green hard hats, there are 15 - 12 = 3 green hard hats left.\n\nFinally, there were 24 yellow hard hats initially. No hard hats of this color were mentioned as taken away, so they remain the same.\n\nSo, the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck is 6 pink hard hats + 3 green hard hats + 24 yellow hard hats = 33 hard hats.\n\nFinal Answer: 33 hard hats",
