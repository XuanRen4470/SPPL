The correct interpretation is that the sum of the products of the faces taken three at a time is \\(\\frac{1001}{3}\\), but since we are dealing with integers, we need to find a way to express the sum of the faces.\n\nThe correct approach is to recognize that the sum of the products of the faces taken three at a time is a symmetric function of the faces, and the sum of the faces is a simpler expression. By symmetry and the properties of the cube, the sum of the faces \\(a + b + c + d + e + f\\) is the key.

        "To solve the problem, let's denote the dimensions of the rectangle as \\( l \\) (length) and \\( w \\) (width), where \\( l \\) and \\( w \\) are integers and \\( l \\neq w \\). The area of the rectangle is given by \\( lw \\) and the perimeter is given by \\( 2(l + w) \\). According to the problem, the area is numerically equal to the perimeter, so we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ lw = 2(l + w) \\]\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ lw - 2l - 2w = 0 \\]\n\nTo solve this equation, we can add 4 to both sides to facilitate factoring:\n\n\\[ lw - 2l - 2w + 4 = 4 \\]\n\nThis can be factored as:\n\n\\[ (l-2)(w-2) = 4 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find pairs of integers \\((l-2)\\) and \\((w-2)\\) that multiply to 4. The possible pairs are \\((1, 4)\\), \\((4, 1)\\), \\((-1, -4)\\), \\((-4, -1)\\), \\((2, 2)\\), and \\((-2, -2)\\). Since \\( l \\) and \\( w \\) are integers and the rectangle is non-square, we can discard the pairs \\((2, 2)\\) and \\((-2, -2)\\) because they would make the rectangle a square. We also discard the pairs \\((-1, -4)\\) and \\((-4, -1)\\) because they would result in negative dimensions, which are not valid for a rectangle. This leaves us with the pairs \\((1, 4)\\) and \\((4, 1)\\).\n\nIf \\((l-2) = 1\\) and \\((w-2) = 4\\), then \\( l = 3 \\) and \\( w = 6 \\). If \\((l-2) = 4\\) and \\((w-2) = 1\\), then \\( l = 6 \\) and \\( w = 3 \\). In both cases, the dimensions of the rectangle are 3 and 6. The perimeter of the rectangle is:\n\n\\[ 2(l + w) = 2(3 + 6) = 2 \\times 9 = 18 \\]\n\nThus, the number of units in the perimeter of this rectangle is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]",
        "Given the equations \\(ab + c = 41\\), \\(bc + a = 41\\), and \\(ac + b = 41\\), we start by subtracting the second equation from the first:\n\n\\[\nab + c - (bc + a) = 0 \\implies ab + c - bc - a = 0 \\implies ab - bc + c - a = 0 \\implies b(a - c) + (c - a) = 0 \\implies (b - 1)(a - c) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis implies that either \\(b = 1\\) or \\(a = c\\). Similarly, by subtracting the third equation from the first, we get:\n\n\\[\nab + c - (ac + b) = 0 \\implies ab + c - ac - b = 0 \\implies a(b - c) + (c - b) = 0 \\implies (a - 1)(b - c) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis implies that either \\(a = 1\\) or \\(b = c\\). Finally, by subtracting the second equation from the third, we get:\n\n\\[\nac + b - (bc + a) = 0 \\implies ac + b - bc - a = 0 \\implies a(c - b) + (b - a) = 0 \\implies (a - 1)(c - b) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis implies that either \\(a = 1\\) or \\(c = b\\). From the above, we see that at least two of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) must be equal. Let's consider the case \\(a = b = c\\). Substituting \\(a = b = c\\) into any of the original equations, we get:\n\n\\[\na^2 + a = 41 \\implies a^2 + a - 41 = 0\n\\]\n\nWe solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\(a = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\):\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 164}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{165}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(a\\) is a positive integer, we need to check if \\(\\sqrt{165}\\) is an integer. It is not, so \\(a = b = c\\) is not a solution. Now, let's consider the case where two of the variables are equal and the third is different. Assume \\(a = b\\) and \\(c\\) is different. Then the equations become:\n\n\\[\na^2 + c = 41 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad ac + a = 41\n\\]\n\nFrom \\(ac + a = 41\\), we can factor out \\(a\\):\n\n\\[\na(c + 1) = 41\n\\]\n\nSince 41 is a prime number, the possible factor pairs are \\((1, 41)\\) and \\((41, 1)\\). Therefore, \\(a = 1\\) or \\(a = 41\\). If \\(a = 1\\), then:\n\n\\[\n1(c + 1) = 41 \\implies c + 1 = 41 \\implies c = 40\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(a = 1\\) and \\(c = 40\\) into \\(a^2 + c = 41\\):\n\n\\[\n1^2 + 40 = 41\n\\]\n\nThis is true, so \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = 40\\) is a solution.

The vertex form gives the \\( x \\)-coordinate of the vertex, which is the minimum (or maximum) point of the parabola. For a quadratic function \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), the \\( x \\)-coordinate of the vertex is given by:\n\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{b}{2a}\n\\]\n\nIn the given function \\( 2x^2 - 12x + 3 \\), the coefficients are \\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = -12 \\), and \\( c = 3 \\). Plugging these values into the vertex formula, we get:\n\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{-12}{2 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{12}{4} = 3\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( x \\) that gives the minimum value of the function is \\( x = 3 \\).\n\nTo verify, we can substitute \\( x = 3 \\) back into the original function to find the minimum value:\n\n\\[\n2(3)^2 - 12(3) + 3 = 2 \\cdot 9 - 36 + 3 = 18 - 36 + 3 = -15\n\\]\n\nThe minimum value of the function is indeed \\(-15\\) when \\( x = 3 \\).\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( x \\) that gives the minimum value of \\( 2x^2 - 12x + 3 \\) is \\(\\boxed{3}\\)."
