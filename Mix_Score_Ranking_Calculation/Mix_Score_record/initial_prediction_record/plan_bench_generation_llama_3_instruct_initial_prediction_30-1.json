Stack the orange block on top of the red block (since the red block is clear)\n\nHowever, there's a problem with this plan. In step 6, we stack the yellow block on top of the blue block, but the goal is to have the blue block on top of the yellow block, not the other way around. This means we need to revisit the plan.\n\nHere's an alternative plan:\n\n1. Pick up the red block (since the hand is empty and the red block is clear)\n2. Stack the red block on top of the blue block (since the blue block is clear)\n3. Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block (since the blue block was really on top of the yellow block and is clear)\n4. Put down the blue block (since the hand is holding the blue block)\n5. Pick up the yellow block (since the hand is empty and the yellow block is clear)\n6. Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block (since the yellow block is clear)\n7. Unstack the orange block from on top of the red block (since the orange block was really on top of the red block and is clear)\n8. Put down the orange block (since the hand is holding the orange block)\n9. Pick up the red block (since the hand is empty and the red block is clear)\n10. Stack the orange block on top of the red block (since the red block is clear)\n11. Pick up the orange block (since the hand is empty and the orange block is clear)\n12. Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block (since the orange block is clear)\n\nThis plan should achieve the desired goal.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue yellow)\n",
