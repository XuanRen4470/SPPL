This implies that the remaining 1.47% of the population identified as two or more races.\n\nSince we're looking for the percentage of people who are not American, we can combine the percentages of people who identified as \"American\" (8.1%) with the percentages of people who identified as two or more races (1.47%). This gives us a total of 9.57% of the population that is either American or identifies with multiple races.\n\nTo find the percentage of people who are not American, we subtract this total from 100%:\n\n100% - 9.57% = 90.43%\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 90.43%.",
