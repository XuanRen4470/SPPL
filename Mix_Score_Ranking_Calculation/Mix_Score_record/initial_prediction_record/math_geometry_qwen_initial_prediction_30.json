        "To solve the problem, we start by noting that a hexagon inscribed in a circle has equal opposite angles and the sides subtend equal angles at the center of the circle. Let the hexagon be \\(ABCDEF\\) with \\(AB = 31\\) and the other five sides equal to 81. Without loss of generality, we can assume \\(A, B, C, D, E, F\\) are in that order around the circle.\n\nSince the hexagon is inscribed in a circle, the sides subtend equal angles at the center if they are equal. Therefore, the sides \\(BC, CD, DE, EF, FA\\) all subtend the same angle at the center, and the side \\(AB\\) subtends a different angle. Let the radius of the circle be \\(R\\). The central angle subtended by each of the sides \\(BC, CD, DE, EF, FA\\) is \\(\\theta\\), and the central angle subtended by \\(AB\\) is \\(2\\pi - 5\\theta\\).\n\nUsing the law of cosines in the isosceles triangle formed by two radii and the side of the hexagon, we can find the relationship between the side length and the radius. For the sides \\(BC, CD, DE, EF, FA\\) (each of length 81), we have:\n\\[\n81^2 = 2R^2 (1 - \\cos \\theta)\n\\]\nFor the side \\(AB\\) (of length 31), we have:\n\\[\n31^2 = 2R^2 (1 - \\cos (2\\pi - 5\\theta)) = 2R^2 (1 - \\cos 5\\theta)\n\\]\nUsing the double angle formula for cosine, \\(\\cos 5\\theta = 1 - 16 \\sin^2 \\left(\\frac{5\\theta}{2}\\right) + 32 \\sin^4 \\left(\\frac{5\\theta}{2}\\right) - 16 \\sin^6 \\left(\\frac{5\\theta}{2}\\right)\\), but we can simplify by noting that \\(\\cos 5\\theta = 1 - 16 \\sin^2 \\left(\\frac{5\\theta}{2}\\right) + 32 \\sin^4 \\left(\\frac{5\\theta}{2}\\right) - 16 \\sin^6 \\left(\\frac{5\\theta}{2}\\right)\\) is complex, and we can use the simpler form:\n\\[\n31^2 = 2R^2 (1 - (2 \\cos \\theta - 1)) = 2R^2 (2 - 2 \\cos \\theta) = 4R^2 (1 - \\cos \\theta)\n\\]\nFrom the first equation, we have:\n\\[\n81^2 = 2R^2 (1 - \\cos \\theta) \\implies 6561 = 2R^2 (1 - \\cos \\theta) \\implies 1 - \\cos \\theta = \\frac{6561}{2R^2}\n\\]\nFrom the second equation, we have:\n\\[\n31^2 = 4R^2 (1 - \\cos \\theta) \\implies 961 = 4R^2 (1 - \\cos \\theta) \\implies 1 - \\cos \\theta = \\frac{961}{4R^2}\n\\]\nEquating the two expressions for \\(1 - \\cos \\theta\\), we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{6561}{2R^2} = \\frac{961}{4R^2} \\implies 6561 \\cdot 2 = 961 \\cdot 4 \\implies 13122 = 3844 \\implies \\frac{6561}{2R^2} = \\frac{961}{4R^2} \\implies 6561 \\cdot 2 = 961 \\cdot 4 \\implies 13122 = 3844 \\implies R = 50\n\\]\nNow, we need to find the lengths of the diagonals \\(AD, AE, AF\\). Using the fact that the hexagon is symmetric and the sides are equal except for \\(AB\\), we can use the fact that the diagonals of a cyclic hexagon with equal sides except one can be found using the properties of the circle and the symmetry. The lengths of the diagonals \\(AD, AE, AF\\) are all equal to the length of the side of the hexagon if we consider the symmetry and the properties of the circle. Therefore, the lengths of the diagonals are all 81.\n\nThus, the sum of the lengths of the three diagonals from \\(A\\) is:\n\\[\n81 + 81 + 81 = 243\n\\]\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{243}\n\\]",
        "To solve for \\(BC^2\\) in the trapezoid \\(ABCD\\) where \\(AB \\perp BC\\) and \\(CD \\perp BC\\), and the diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) are perpendicular, we start by placing the trapezoid in the coordinate plane for convenience. Let \\(B = (0, 0)\\), \\(A = (\\sqrt{11}, 0)\\), \\(C = (0, h)\\), and \\(D = (x, h)\\).\n\nSince \\(AD = \\sqrt{1001}\\), we can use the distance formula to express this:\n\\[\nAD = \\sqrt{(\\sqrt{11} - x)^2 + h^2} = \\sqrt{1001}.\n\\]\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{11} - x)^2 + h^2 = 1001.\n\\]\nExpanding and rearranging terms, we have:\n\\[\n11 - 2\\sqrt{11}x + x^2 + h^2 = 1001,\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 - 2\\sqrt{11}x + h^2 = 990.\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the fact that the diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) are perpendicular.

To solve for \\(x\\), we use the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -\\sqrt{11}\\), and \\(c = -990\\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{\\sqrt{11} \\pm \\sqrt{11 + 4 \\cdot 990}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{11} \\pm \\sqrt{3971}}{2}.\n\\]\nSince \\(x\\) must be positive, we take the positive root:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{\\sqrt{11} + \\sqrt{3971}}{2}.\n\\]\nNow, substituting \\(x\\) back into \\(h^2 = \\sqrt{11}x\\), we get:\n\\[\nh^2 = \\sqrt{11} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{11} + \\sqrt{3971}}{2} = \\frac{11 + \\sqrt{11 \\cdot 3971}}{2} = \\frac{11 + \\sqrt{43681}}{2} = \\frac{11 + 209}{2} = 110.\n\\]\nThus, the value of \\(BC^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{110}.\n\\]",
        "To solve the problem, we will use the Angle Bisector Theorem and mass points. The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the angle bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the adjacent sides. Therefore, in triangle \\(ABC\\), the angle bisector of \\(\\angle A\\) intersects \\(BC\\) at point \\(D\\) such that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{BD}{DC} = \\frac{AB}{AC} = \\frac{20}{11}\n\\]\n\nNext, we assign mass points to the vertices of the triangle. Let the mass of \\(C\\) be 20 and the mass of \\(B\\) be 11. Since \\(D\\) divides \\(BC\\) in the ratio \\(20:11\\), the mass of \\(D\\) is \\(20 + 11 = 31\\). The mass of \\(A\\) is the sum of the masses of \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) as seen from the angle bisector, so we can assign a mass of 1 to \\(A\\).\n\nNow, we need to find the mass of point \\(M\\), the midpoint of \\(AD\\). Since \\(A\\) has a mass of 1 and \\(D\\) has a mass of 31, the mass of \\(M\\) is the average of the masses of \\(A\\) and \\(D\\), which is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 + 31}{2} = 16\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the mass of point \\(P\\), the intersection of \\(BM\\) and \\(AC\\). Since \\(B\\) has a mass of 11 and \\(M\\) has a mass of 16, the mass of \\(P\\) can be determined by considering the line \\(BM\\) intersecting \\(AC\\). The mass of \\(P\\) is the sum of the masses of \\(B\\) and \\(M\\) as seen from \\(C\\), which is:\n\n\\[\n11 + 16 = 27\n\\]\n\nThe ratio of \\(CP\\) to \\(PA\\) is the ratio of the mass of \\(A\\) to the mass of \\(C\\) as seen from \\(P\\), which is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{PA}{PC} = \\frac{\\text{mass of } C}{\\text{mass of } A} = \\frac{20}{1} = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, the ratio \\(CP:PA\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{20}\\).

The line \\(PQ\\) is the orthic axis of the triangle \\(ABC\\).\n\nGiven that \\(XP = 10\\), \\(PQ = 25\\), and \\(QY = 15\\), we can determine the length of \\(XY\\) as follows:\n\\[\nXY = XP + PQ + QY = 10 + 25 + 15 = 50.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are points on the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABC\\), and \\(PQ\\) is the orthic axis, we can use the fact that \\(PQ\\) is the radical axis of the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABC\\) and the nine-point circle of \\(\\triangle ABC\\). The power of point \\(P\\) with respect to the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABC\\) is equal to the power of point \\(P\\) with respect to the nine-point circle of \\(\\triangle ABC\\).\n\nThe power of point \\(P\\) with respect to the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABC\\) is \\(PA \\cdot PB\\), and the power of point \\(P\\) with respect to the nine-point circle of \\(\\triangle ABC\\) is \\(\\left(\\frac{R}{2}\\right)^2 - OP^2\\), where \\(R\\) is the circumradius of \\(\\triangle ABC\\) and \\(O\\) is the circumcenter.

Since \\(BC\\) is tangent to the circle at \\(T_3\\), we can use the fact that the power of point \\(A\\) with respect to the circle is the same for both tangents. The power of point \\(A\\) is \\(AT_1^2 = AT_2^2 = 12^2 = 144\\).\n\nNow, let's denote the lengths \\(AB = x\\) and \\(AC = y\\). Since \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) are points on the tangents from \\(A\\) and \\(BC\\) is tangent to the circle at \\(T_3\\), we can use the fact that the tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, the segments \\(BT_3\\) and \\(CT_3\\) are both equal to 5. The length of \\(BC\\) is given as 7. We can use the fact that the tangents from a point to a circle are equal and the properties of the tangents to find the lengths \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\).\n\nUsing the fact that the tangents from a point to a circle are equal, we can use the formula for the length of the tangent segments from a point to a circle. The length of the tangent segment from \\(B\\) to \\(T_3\\) is 5, and the length of the tangent segment from \\(C\\) to \\(T_3\\) is also 5. Therefore, the lengths \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\) can be found using the fact that the tangents from a point to a circle are equal.\n\nThe length \\(AB\\) is \\(x = AT_1 - BT_3 = 12 - 5 = 7\\) and the length \\(AC\\) is \\(y = AT_2 - CT_3 = 12 - 5 = 7\\). Therefore, the sum \\(AB + AC = 7 + 7 = 14\\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",
