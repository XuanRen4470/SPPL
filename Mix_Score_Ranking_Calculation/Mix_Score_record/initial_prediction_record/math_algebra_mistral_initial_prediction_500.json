        "To find the distinct solutions to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$, we need to find the values of $x$ that make the absolute values on the left and right sides equal.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case when $|x-7|$ is greater than or equal to $|x+1|$. This occurs when $x-7 > x+1$, or when $x < -6$.\n\nWhen $x < -6$, we have:\n\n$$|x-7| = |x+1|$$\n$$|x-7| = |1+x|$$\n$$|x-7| = 1+x$$ (since $x < -6$, $x+1$ has the same sign as $x-7$)\n$$x-7 = 1+x$$\n$$x = 8$$\n\nSo, when $x < -6$, there is exactly one solution.\n\nNext, let's consider the case when $|x-7|$ is less than or equal to $|x+1|$. This occurs when $|x+1| > |x-7|$, or when $x+1 > |x-7|$.\n\nWe can rewrite the inequality as:\n\n$$|x+1| > |x-7|$$\n$$|x+1| > |x-7|$$\n$$x+1 > x-7$$\n$$2x < 6$$\n$$x < -\\frac{3}{2}$$ or $$x > \\frac{3}{2}$$\n\nSo, there are two intervals where $x$ can lie: $(-\\infty, -\\frac{3}{2})$ and $(\\frac{3}{2}, \\infty)$.\n\nInside each interval, there are infinitely many solutions.

We also know that the average of the two scores is 80, so we can set up another equation:\n\n(8)*m + b = 80\n\nNow, we need to find the value of m that makes the sum of these two equations true. We can solve for m by setting both equations equal to each other:\n\n(8)*m + b = 80\nm*(8) + b = 80\nm = (80 - b) / 8\n\nSince we don't have enough information to determine the value of b, we cannot find the exact value of m. However, we can make an assumption that John wants to improve his score from 70 to 80, which would mean an increase of 10 points. This implies that m must be a number that makes the difference between the sleep hours and the exam scores approximately equal to 10.\n\nLet's try some values for m and see if they make sense:\n\nIf m = -1, then b = 72. The equation would be Y = -X + 72. In this case, if John sleeps for 8 hours, his score would be approximately 74, which is not a significant improvement.\n\nIf m = -1.25, then b = 67.5. The equation would be Y = -1.25X + 67.5. In this case, if John sleeps for 8 hours, his score would be approximately 72.5, which is not quite the 80 that John wants.\n\nIf m = -1.5, then b = 64. The equation would be Y = -1.5X + 64. In this case, if John sleeps for 8 hours, his score would be approximately 72, which is still not quite 80.\n\nIf m = -1.67, then b = 60.3. The equation would be Y = -1.67X + 60.3. In this case, if John sleeps for 8 hours, his score would be approximately 71.2, which is closer to 80.\n\nBased on our analysis, it seems that John believes he needs to sleep for approximately 8 hours less than what it took for him to score a 70 to achieve an average score of 80. This would mean sleeping for around 6 hours and 48 minutes (6.8 hours) the night before the second exam.\n\nFinal Answer: John believes he must sleep for approximately 6.8 hours the night before his second exam.",

We can do this by adding and subtracting $(7/2)x$ on the left side:\n\n$$x^2 = 7x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x^2 - 7x = -12$$\n\nNext, we add and subtract $(7/2)^2$ on the left side to complete the square:\n\n$$x^2 - 7x + \\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2 - 12$$\n\nSimplifying the right side:\n\n$$\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2 - 12 = \\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{12}{2}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{7}{2} - 3\\right)\\left(\\frac{7}{2} + 3\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{14}{2}\\right) = 7\\cdot 2 = 14$$\n\nNow, we have the equation in the form $(x-a)^2 = b$:\n\n$$(x-a)^2 = 14$$\n\nTo find the solutions, we need to find the value of $a$:\n\n$$x-a = \\pm\\sqrt{14}$$\n\n$$x = a \\pm \\sqrt{14}$$\n\nNow, we need to find the value of $a$:\n\n$$a = x - \\sqrt{14} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad a = x + \\sqrt{14}$$\n\nWe have two possible solutions:\n\n$$x = a - \\sqrt{14} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = x + \\sqrt{14}$$\n\n$$x = a + \\sqrt{14} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = x - \\sqrt{14}$$\n\nSince the two solutions are opposite in sign, they differ only by a constant.

We know that $1+2+\\cdots+n=\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.\n\nWe want to find the conditions on $n$ such that $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ is even and divisible by $3$.\n\nFirst, let's find the conditions for $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ to be even: $n$ and $(n+1)$ must have the same parity, meaning they are both even or both odd.\n\nNext, let's find the conditions for $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ to be divisible by $3$: $n$ and $(n+1)$ must have a difference that is a multiple of $3$.\n\nWhen $n$ is even, $(n+1)$ is odd, and their difference is even, but it is not always a multiple of $3$. However, when $n$ is a multiple of $3$, then $(n+1)$ is also a multiple of $3$ (since $3$ and $2$ are coprime), and their difference is a multiple of $3$.\n\nTherefore, $n$ must be a positive multiple of $3$ for $1+2+\\cdots+n$ to evenly divide $6n$.\n\nFinal Answer: For every positive multiple of $3$, $1+2+\\cdots+n$ evenly divides $6n$. So the answer is the count of positive integers that are multiples of $3$. This can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: $\\frac{3}{2}(3a+1)$, where $a$ is the first term ($3$). The first term is $3$, so the sum of the first $n$ terms is $\\frac{3}{2}(3\\cdot3+1)=\\frac{3}{2}(10)=\\boxed{15}$. However, since we're only considering multiples of $3$, we should start with the first multiple of $3$, which is $3$, and go up to $n$ in increments of $3$. So the actual number of terms is $\\boxed{\\frac{n}{3}}$.",

To confirm these values, we can use a calculator or numerical methods to find the roots of the equation $u(x)=0$.\n\nTo find the behavior of the function at these points, we need to evaluate the limit of the function as $x$ approaches each point from the right and from the left.

Therefore, we can find the distinct possible values of $t$ by finding the values of $m^2$ and $n^2$ and taking their difference:\n\n$$t=(\\frac{m^2-n^2}{4})$$\n\nWe can find the distinct values of $m$ and $n$ by using the fact that they are the sum and difference of two square numbers, respectively:\n\n$$m=p^2+2p\\sqrt{5}+5$$\n\n$$n=p^2-2p\\sqrt{5}+5$$\n\nwhere $p$ is a positive integer. By trying different values of $p$, we can find the distinct values of $m$ and $n$ and therefore the distinct values of $t$.\n\nAfter finding all the distinct values of $t$, we can calculate the average of these values.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this problem can have an infinite number of distinct solutions, as there are infinitely many integer solutions for $p$ that satisfy the condition that $m$ and $n$ are integers. Therefore, the problem as stated may not have a well-defined answer.\n\nFinal Answer: The problem does not have a well-defined answer due to the infinite number of distinct possible values of $t$.",

        "To find the value of $b$ that satisfies the given condition, we need to find the values of $x$ that make $-x^2+bx-5$ negative. We can do this by finding the solutions to the inequality $-x^2+bx-5<0$. This is a quadratic inequality in the variable $x$.\n\nFirst, we need to find the quadratic equation that corresponds to the given inequality. We have $-x^2+bx-5<0$, which is equivalent to $-$1$*(x^2$-$bx$+$5)<0$. So, the quadratic equation is $x^2$-$bx$+$5=0$.\n\nNext, we need to find the solutions to the quadratic equation. Since the discriminant of the quadratic equation is $b^2$-$4*1*5=-b^2+20<0$, there are no real solutions. This means that the inequality $-x^2+bx-5<0$ is satisfied for all real values of $x$ that make the expression $-x^2+bx-5$ negative.\n\nTo find the values of $x$ that make $-x^2+bx-5$ negative, we can look at the sign of the coefficient of the $x^2$ term ($-$1$)$ and the constant term ($-$5$)$. Since the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is negative, the expression is negative for large positive and large negative values of $x$. Specifically, the expression is negative when $x<-\\sqrt{b/2+5/2}$ or when $x>\\sqrt{b/2+5/2}$.\n\nTherefore, the given inequality is satisfied when $x\\in (-\\infty, 1)\\cup(5,\\infty)$. Since $x=1$ and $x=5$ are not solutions to the quadratic equation, we can choose any value of $b$ that makes $b/2+5/2>0$.

        "This is a classic problem known as the \"binary halving\" or \"binary splitting\" problem. The number of times Shaffiq must divide his number by two to reach 1 is given by the number of bits in the binary representation of 1 (which is 1), but since he keeps the greatest integer less than or equal to each result, we need to find the number of bits in the binary representation of the next smallest number, which is 1 minus 1 = 0. So we're looking for the number of bits in the binary representation of 0, which is infinite because 0 has no binary representation! However, we can find the number of times Shaffiq must divide by 2 before he reaches a number less than 1, which is 1/2. Since he keeps the greatest integer less than or equal to each result, the smallest number he will get is 0, which he will reach when he divides by 2 exactly log2(1/2) = log2(1/2) * log2(2) = log2(1/2) * 1 = log base 2 of 1/2 = log base 2 of 0.5 = 3. This is called the \"binary logarithm\" of 1/2, and it's approximately equal to 3.322. Since Shaffiq can't divide by a fraction, he must round up to the nearest power of 2 and add 1 to account for the initial number 100. So he must divide by 2 approximately 3 + 1 = 4 times to get close to 1, but since he keeps the greatest integer less than or equal to each result, he will actually reach 1 when he divides by 2 5 times.\n\nFinal Answer: 5.",

        "Let's denote the amount Susie invested at the Pretty Penny Bank as P and the amount invested at the Five and Dime Bank as F. We know that:\n\nP + F = 1000\n\nWe also know that after two years, the total amount of money Susie has is $1090.02. So we can write another equation:\n\nP * (1 + 0.03)^2 + F * (1 + 0.05)^2 = 1090.02\n\nNow we have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination method. However, there is a more straightforward way to solve this problem using trial and error.\n\nLet's assume that Susie invested a larger amount at the Pretty Penny Bank and a smaller amount at the Five and Dime Bank. If Susie had invested $950 at the Five and Dime Bank, then she would have invested $50 at the Pretty Penny Bank. After two years, the amount at the Five and Dime Bank would be:\n\n$50 * (1 + 0.05)^2 = $602.50\n\nAnd the amount at the Pretty Penny Bank would be:\n\n$1000 - $50 = $950\n\nAfter two years, the total amount would be:\n\n$950 * (1 + 0.03)^2 + $602.50 = $1061.25\n\nThis is not the correct answer, but it's close. We need to adjust the amount Susie invested at the Pretty Penny Bank slightly. Let's try increasing it by $50:\n\n$1000 - $50 = $950 (Five and Dime)\n$950 + $X = 1000 (Pretty Penny)\n\nNow let's calculate the total amount after two years:\n\n$950 * (1 + 0.03)^2 + $1000 * (1 + 0.05)^2 = $1090.02\n\nWe can simplify this equation by factoring out the common terms:\n\n$1000 * ((1+0.03)^2 + (1+0.05)^2) = $1090.02\n\nNow we can use a calculator to find the value of ((1+0.03)^2 + (1+0.05)^2), which is approximately 1.110315. Multiplying $1000 by this value gives us $1110.31, which is not the correct answer. We need to adjust the amount Susie invested at the Pretty Penny Bank again.\n\nLet's try decreasing it by $10:\n\n$950 + $X = 1000\n$950 + $X = $1090.02 - $950\n$X = $140.02\n\nSo Susie invested $860 at the Five and Dime Bank, and $140.02 at the Pretty Penny Bank. This gives us the correct total amount after two years.\n\nFinal Answer: Susie Q originally invested at the Pretty Penny Bank, in dollars: $140.02.",
        "Let's denote the width as W and the length as L. We know that the length is 15 ft longer than the width, so L = W + 15. The area of the rectangle is given by the product of its length and width, so 100 sq. ft = W(W + 15).\n\nTo find the width, we need to solve this quadratic equation: W^2 + 15W - 100 = 0. We can use the quadratic formula to solve for W:\n\nW = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2-4ac)) / 2a\n\nwhere a = 1, b = 15, and c = -100.\n\nCalculating the discriminant (b\u00b2-4ac), we get:\n\nb\u00b2-4ac = 15\u00b2-4(1)(-100) = 225 + 400 = 625\n\nNow, let's find the two possible solutions for W:\n\nW\u2081 = (-15 + \u221a625) / 2 = -7.5 + 25.11 / 2 = 8.11 ft (approximately)\nW\u2082 = (-15 - \u221a625) / 2 = -15.5 - 25.11 / 2 = -18.11 ft (approximately)\n\nSince the width cannot be negative, we discard the second solution, and our final answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: The width should be approximately 8.11 ft.",

        "To find the value of $a-b+c$, we need to identify the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$ from the given graph. From the quadratic equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$, we know that:\n\n- The coefficient $a$ determines the parabola's shape (whether it opens up or down). In this graph, it's clear that the parabola opens up, so $a$ is positive.\n- The coefficient $b$ determines the $x$-intercept of the parabola (where it crosses the $x$-axis). In the given graph, we can't directly see the $x$-intercept, but we can estimate it by looking at the $x$-values where the parabola intersects the $x$-axis approximately. The $x$-axis intercepts occur when $y=0$, so we need to solve the equation $x^2+2x-1=0$. This quadratic equation has roots at approximately $-1\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. So, the $x$-intercepts are approximately $-1.41$ and $-2.59$. Since the $x$-axis intercepts are negative, we know that $b$ is also negative.\n- The constant term $c$ determines the $y$-intercept of the parabola (where it crosses the $y$-axis). In the given graph, the parabola crosses the $y$-axis at approximately $1$. So, the $y$-intercept is $c=1$.\n\nNow, we can find $a-b+c$:\n\nSince $a$ is positive, $b$ is negative, and $c$ is positive, we have:\n\n$a-b+c = a - (-b) + 1$\n\n$= a + b + 1$\n\nSince we estimated that the $x$-intercepts are approximately $-1.41$ and $-2.59$, we can use this information to find $b$:\n\n$b = -(2\\times(-1.41))-1$\n\n$= 2.82-1$\n\n$= 1.82$\n\nNow, we can find $a$:\n\n$a = \\dfrac{1}{(-1.41)^2+(-1.82)^2+1}$\n\n$= \\dfrac{1}{1.97+3.24+1}$\n\n$= \\dfrac{1}{6.2}$\n\n$= 0.159$\n\nSo, $a-b+c = 0.159 + 1.82 + 1 = 2.001$.\n\nFinal Answer: 2.001 (approximately)",
