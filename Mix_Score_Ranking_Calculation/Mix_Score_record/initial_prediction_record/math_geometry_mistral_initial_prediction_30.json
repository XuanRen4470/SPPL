        "To find the lengths of the diagonals, we first need to find the radius of the circle. We know that the sum of the lengths of the sides of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle is given by:\n\n$$6s = 6 \\cdot 2r$$\n\nwhere $s$ is the length of one side and $r$ is the radius of the circle. Since five sides have length $81$, the sixth side has length $31$, and there are $6$ sides in total:\n\n$$6 \\cdot (81 + 31) = 6 \\cdot 112 = 672$$\n\nSo, the sum of the lengths of all sides is $672$.

The base of the pyramid is a rectangle with sides $6$ and $8$, so its area is $A_b = 6\\times 8 = 48$. Let's call the height of the pyramid $h$ and the slant height $s$.\n\nAccording to the problem, each edge from the apex to a corner of the base has length $13$. This edge is also the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by the height and half the base length. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\n$$s^2 = h^2 + \\left(\\frac{6}{2}\\right)^2 = h^2 + 9$$\n\nWe know that the volume $V$ of a pyramid is given by:\n\n$$V = \\frac{1}{3}Ah$$\n\nwhere $A$ is the area of the base and $h$ is the height.

Unfortunately, this equation does not have an easy solution, so we would need to use numerical methods or a calculator to find the exact value of $s$ and the volume.\n\nHowever, if we assume that $s$ is approximately equal to $h$ (which is reasonable since the base and height are close in size), we can make an approximation:\n\n$$s \\approx h$$\n\nSubstituting this approximation into the equation for $V$:\n\n$$V \\approx \\frac{1}{3}(48)(s^2) = \\frac{1}{3}(48)(h^2)$$\n\nUsing the given information that $h$ is related to $s$ through $s^2 = h^2 + 9$, we can write:\n\n$$h^2 = s^2 - 9$$\n\nSubstituting $s \\approx h$:\n\n$$h^2 = h^2 + 9 - 9$$\n\n$$h^2 = 9$$\n\n$$h \\approx 3$$\n\nNow, we can approximate the volume:\n\n$$V \\approx \\frac{1}{3}(48)(3^2) = \\boxed{48\\cdot 9 = \\boxed{145.8}}$$\n\nFinal answer: 145.8 (approximately)",

        "To find the length of the side of the base, we can use the formula for the area of a right pyramid with an equilateral triangular base:\n\nArea = (1/2) * \u221a3 * s^2 * (3\u221a2 / 4)\n\nWe are given the area (75 square meters) and the slant height (30 meters). We can solve for the side length (s) as follows:\n\n75 = (1/2) * \u221a3 * s^2 * (3\u221a2 / 4)\n\nFirst, let's simplify the equation:\n\n75 = (1/2) * \u221a3 * s^2 * (3\u221a2)\n\nDivide both sides by (1/2) * \u221a3:\n\n150 = s^2 * 3\u221a2\n\nNow, divide both sides by (3\u221a2):\n\n50 = s^2\n\nTake the square root of both sides to find s:\n\ns = \u221a50\ns = 5 * \u221a2\n\nFinally, to find the length of the side of the base, we need to find the side length of the equilateral triangle. Since all sides of an equilateral triangle are equal, we can use the relationship between the side length and the slant height in a right triangle:\n\na = s / \u221a3\n\nSubstitute the value of s:\n\na = (5 * \u221a2) / \u221a3\n\nSimplify:\n\na = (5 * \u221a2) / (\u221a3 * \u221a3)\na = (5 * \u221a2) / \u221a3^2\na = (5 * \u221a2) / 3\n\nFinal Answer: a \u2248 8.95 meters.",
        "To find the tangent of an angle, we can use the following formula:\n\ntan(\u03b8) = opposite / adjacent\n\nHowever, the angle given is $225^\\circ$, which is not in the first or second quadrant where we can easily find the tangent using the standard trigonometric ratios.\n\nTo find the tangent of an angle in the third or fourth quadrant, we can use the following relationship:\n\ntan(\u03b8) = -cot(\u03c0/2 - \u03b8)\n\nHere, cot is the cotangent function.\n\nFirst, let's find the quadrant in which $225^\\circ$ lies. We know that $225^\\circ$ is a multiple of $90^\\circ$, so it lies in the third quadrant.\n\nNow, we can find the cotangent of $\\pi/2 - 225^\\circ$:\n\n\u03c0/2 - 225\u00b0 = \u03c0/2 - 180\u00b0 - 45\u00b0 = 135\u00b0\n\nUsing the standard trigonometric ratios, we have:\n\ncot(135\u00b0) = \u221a2 - 1 \u2248 0.4142\n\nNow, we can find the tangent of $225^\\circ$:\n\ntan(225\u00b0) = -cot(135\u00b0) \u2248 -0.4142\n\nFinal Answer: Approximately -0.4142.",
        "Let's denote the common difference of the arithmetic sequence as d. Since the sum of the angles in a convex polygon is equal to (n-2)*180 degrees, where n is the number of sides, and the degree measures of the angles form an arithmetic sequence with integer values, the smallest angle can be found by subtracting (n-2) times the common difference from 180 degrees.\n\nGiven that there are 18 sides, we have:\n\nn = 18\nd =?\n\nThe sum of the angles in this polygon is:\n\n180*(18-2) = 180*16 = 2880\n\nSince the degree measures of the angles form an increasing arithmetic sequence with integer values, the smallest angle is given by:\n\nsmallest angle = 180 - (n-2)*d\n\nWe don't have enough information to find the value of d, but we can express it in terms of the smallest angle:\n\n2880 = 18*180 - 2*(18-2)*d\n\nSolving this equation for d, we get:\n\nd = (2880 - 18*180)/(2*(18-2))\nd = 36\n\nNow, we can find the smallest angle:\n\nsmallest angle = 180 - (18-2)*36\nsmallest angle = 180 - 588\nFinal Answer: smallest angle = -568 degrees\n\nHowever, this result is not valid since the angle measure should be a positive value.

        "To find the ratio of the volumes of a regular octahedron and a cube with given relationships, we can use the known formulas for their volumes and the fact that the edges of an octahedron and a cube that share the same vertices have the same length.\n\nThe edge length of a regular octahedron is equal to that of a cube with the same edge length (since they share the same vertices). The volume of a regular octahedron is given by:\n\nV(Oct) = (\u221a2 / 3) * (s\u00b3)\n\nwhere s is the edge length.\n\nThe volume of a cube with edge length s is:\n\nV(Cube) = s\u00b3\n\nNow, we are given that the ratio of their volumes is m/n, where m and n are relatively prime integers. So, we have:\n\n(\u221a2 / 3) * (s\u00b3) = (m/n) * s\u00b3\n\nTo simplify this equation, we can cancel out the s\u00b3 term:\n\n(\u221a2 / 3) = (m/n)\n\nNow, we need to find m + n. Since \u221a2 is an irrational number, m and n cannot both be integers. Therefore, one of them must be an even number, and the other must be an odd number. Let's assume m is the even number.\n\nWe can write \u221a2 as 2 * (\u221a2 / 2), so our equation becomes:\n\n(2 * (\u221a2 / 2) / 3) * s\u00b3 = (m/n) * s\u00b3\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3 and simplifying:\n\n(\u221a2 / \u221a2 / 2) * s\u00b3 = m * s\u00b3 / n\n\nSince \u221a2 / \u221a2 = 1, we have:\n\ns\u00b3 = (m / n) * s\u00b3\n\nDividing both sides by s\u00b3:\n\n1 = m / n\n\nSince m and n are relatively prime, this means that m = 1 and n is the only possible odd number. So, m + n = 1 + n.\n\nHowever, the given ratio m/n was not specified to be a reduced fraction, so it's possible that m and n have a common factor other than 1. In that case, the final answer would be different. But since the problem states that m and n are relatively prime, our assumption that m is even and n is odd leads to the correct answer.\n\nFinal Answer: n + 1.",

        ": Let the center of circle $C$ be the origin $O$, and let the line segment $\\overline{AB}$ lie on the x-axis with $A$ being the point $(2,0)$ and $B$ being the point $(-2,0)$. Since circle $C$ has radius 2, its diameter passes through the origin.\n\nCircle $D$ is internally tangent to circle $C$ at point $A$, so the radius of circle $D$ is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 2 (the radius of circle $C$) and the distance from the center of circle $C$ to point $A$. This distance is given by the difference between the radius of circle $C$ and the distance from point $A$ to the center of circle $D$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\n$$r_D^2 = r_C^2 + (r_C - d)^2$$\n\nwhere $r_C = 2$ and $d$ is the distance from point $A$ to the center of circle $D$. Since circle $E$ is externally tangent to circle $D$ and tangent to the diameter of circle $C$ at point $B$, we have:\n\n$$r_E = r_D - d$$\n\nWe're given that the radius of circle $D$ is three times the radius of circle $E$, so:\n\n$$r_D = 3r_E$$\n\nSubstituting $r_E$ from the previous equation, we get:\n\n$$r_D = 3(r_D - d)$$\n\nSolving for $r_D$, we find:\n\n$$r_D = 3r_D - 3d$$\n\n$$2r_D = 3r_D - 3d$$\n\n$$r_D = \\frac{3}{2}d$$\n\nNow, we can find the distance $d$ using the fact that circle $E$ is tangent to the diameter of circle $C$ at point $B$:\n\n$$\\sqrt{(2-r_E)^2+(0-0)^2} + \\sqrt{(2+r_E)^2+(0-0)^2} = 2r_C$$\n\n$$\\sqrt{(2-r_E)^2+0^2} + \\sqrt{(2+r_E)^2+0^2} = 4$$\n\n$$2\\sqrt{1+(r_E-1)^2} + 2\\sqrt{1+(r_E+1)^2} = 8$$\n\n$$4\\sqrt{1+r_E^2+2r_E} = 8$$\n\n$$\\sqrt{1+r_E^2+2r_E} = 2$$\n\n$$1+r_E^2+2r_E = 4$$\n\n$$r_E^2+2r_E+1 = 3$$\n\n$$(r_E+1)^2 = 3$$\n\n$$r_E+1 = \\sqrt{3}$$\n\n$$r_E = \\sqrt{3}-1$$\n\nNow, we can find the distance $d$:\n\n$$d = r_C - r_E = 2 - (\\sqrt{3}-1) = 2 - \\sqrt{3} + 1 = \\sqrt{3}+1$$\n\nSince the radius of circle $D$ is three times the radius of circle $E$, we have:\n\n$$r_D = \\frac{3}{2}d = \\frac{3}{2}(\\sqrt{3}+1) = \\sqrt{3}^2+3\\sqrt{3}+3 = 3\\sqrt{3}+3$$\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n$$\\sqrt{m}-n = 3\\sqrt{3}+3$$\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\n$$m-n^2 = 3\\sqrt{3}+3$$\n\n$$m = n^2+3\\sqrt{3}+3$$\n\nLet $n^2 = p$. Then, we have:\n\n$$m = p+3\\sqrt{3}+3$$\n\nSince $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, $p$ must be a perfect square. Let $p = q^2$. Then, we have:\n\n$$m = q^2+3\\sqrt{3}+3$$\n\n$$m = (q\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{3})^2+3\\sqrt{3}+3$$\n\n$$m = (\\sqrt{3}(q+\\sqrt{2})^2+3\\sqrt{3}+3$$\n\n$$m = 3(q+\\sqrt{2})^2+3$$\n\nTherefore, $m+n = 3(q+\\sqrt{2})^2+3+n$. Since $n$ is a positive integer, we can choose $q$ and $n$ such that $3(q+\\sqrt{2})^2+3$ is also a positive integer. For example, if we choose $q=1$ and $n=1$, then:\n\n$$m+n = 3(1+\\sqrt{2})^2+3+1 = 7\\sqrt{2}+10$$\n\nFinal Answer: $7\\sqrt{2}+10$",
