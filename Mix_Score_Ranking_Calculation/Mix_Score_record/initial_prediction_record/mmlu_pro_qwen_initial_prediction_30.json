        "The 1:2:4 resonance in Jupiter's moons system refers to the orbital periods of the moons Io, Europa, and Ganymede. Specifically, Io orbits Jupiter once for every two orbits of Europa and once for every four orbits of Ganymede. This resonance is significant because it helps to maintain the stability of their orbits and prevent them from colliding with each other.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n(A) \"It causes the three moons to always be in a straight line.\"\n- This is incorrect. The resonance does not ensure that the moons are always in a straight line.\n\n(B) \"It causes Io to rotate on its axis faster than it orbits Jupiter.\"\n- This is incorrect. The resonance does not affect the rotation of Io on its axis.\n\n(C) \"It creates a gap with no asteroids between the orbits.\"\n- This is incorrect. The resonance does not create a gap for asteroids.\n\n(D) \"It results in the formation of a visible ring around Jupiter.\"\n- This is incorrect. The resonance does not cause the formation of a ring around Jupiter.\n\n(E) \"It prevents the moons from colliding with each other.\"\n- This is correct.

This is a contributing factor but not the primary reason they stand out.\n\n(B) \"Asteroids rotate at a high speed, making them stand out\" - While asteroids do rotate, their rotation speed is not a primary factor in their detection. It's more about their motion over time.\n\n(C) \"Asteroids are larger than most celestial bodies, hence easier to spot\" - This is not accurate. Asteroids are relatively small and would be challenging to spot compared to larger celestial bodies like planets.\n\n(D) \"Asteroids have substantial motion relative to the background stars\" - This is the correct answer. Asteroids move relative to the background stars, which is a key factor in their detection. This motion can be tracked over time, making them stand out in sky surveys.\n\n(E) \"Asteroids have a distinct color that makes them stand out\" - While asteroids can have distinct colors, this is not a primary reason they are detected.\n\n(F) \"Asteroids emit a lot of their own radiation\" - Asteroids do not emit significant radiation that would make them stand out.\n\n(G) \"They emit a high amount of heat, making them detectable\" - Asteroids do not emit a high amount of heat that would make them detectable.\n\n(H) \"They emit a unique sound frequency that can be detected\" - Asteroids do not emit sound frequencies.\n\n(I) \"Asteroids emit pulsed radiation\" - Asteroids do not emit pulsed radiation.\n\nFinal Answer: D",

This is a well-known explanation for many meteor showers.\n\n(G) This option suggests that meteor showers are caused by the Earth passing through a cloud of dust and debris left behind by the disintegration of distant stars. This is highly unlikely because stars do not disintegrate in the same way comets or asteroids do.\n\n(H) This option describes near-Earth asteroids disintegrating as they enter Earth's atmosphere, creating bright meteors. This describes a meteor, not a meteor shower.\n\n(I) This option suggests that meteor showers are caused by the disintegration of satellites and space debris. While this can cause meteor-like phenomena, it is not the primary source of most meteor showers.\n\n(J) This option suggests that the nuclei of comets disintegrate and spread out along their orbital paths, causing meteor showers.
