        "Here's my attempt to solve the problem:\n\nInference: The monster eats a ship every hundred years. Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people. Since the monster eats a ship every hundred years, it has eaten 3 ships in total.\n\nEach new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. Let's say the number of people on the first ship is x. Then, the number of people on the second ship is 2x, and the number of people on the third ship is 4x.\n\nThe total number of people eaten by the monster is the sum of the number of people on each ship: x + 2x + 4x = 847.\n\nCombine like terms: 7x = 847.\n\nDivide both sides by 7: x = 121.\n\nSo, there were 121 people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years.\n\nFinal Answer: 121",

        "I'd be happy to help! Here's my attempt at solving the question:\n\nInference: James creates a movie for $2000. Each DVD costs $6 to make, but he sells it for 2.5 times that much, which is 2.5 * 6 = 15. So, his profit per DVD is 15 - 6 = 9.\n\nHe sells 500 movies a day for 5 days a week, which means he sells 500 * 5 = 2500 movies per week. In 20 weeks, he sells 2500 * 20 = 50,000 movies.\n\nSince each DVD costs $6 to make, his total cost is 6 * 50,000 = 300,000. His total revenue is 15 * 50,000 = 750,000. His profit is the difference between his revenue and cost, which is 750,000 - 300,000 = 450,000.\n\nFinal Answer: 450,000",

He also goes for a weekend bike ride of 200 miles.    If he can bike at 25 mph how much time does he spend biking a week?\n\nInference: For each workday, Tim bikes 20 miles back and forth, so that's 20 x 2 = 40 miles per day. Since he does this for 5 days, he bikes 40 x 5 = 200 miles during the workweek.\n\nIn addition, he goes for a 200-mile bike ride on the weekend. So, in total, he bikes 200 + 200 = 400 miles in a week.\n\nSince he bikes at 25 mph, we can find the total time he spends biking by dividing the total distance by his speed: 400 miles / 25 mph = 16 hours.\n\nFinal Answer: 16",

He then downloaded 400 more files, but deleted 3/5 of them, which is 0.6 * 400 = 240 files. So, he was left with 240 + 240 = 480 files after the second round of deletions. However, 240 of these files were already deleted in the first round, so he was left with 480 - 240 = 240 files.

How much was her previous monthly income?\n\nInference: Let's say Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income is x.\n\nShe spends 40% of her income on rent and utilities, which means 0.4x.\n\nHer salary is increased by $600, and now she spends 25% of her income on rent and utilities. This means the new rent and utilities amount is 0.25(x + 600).\n\nSince the rent and utilities are the same in both cases, we can set up the equation:\n\n0.4x = 0.25(x + 600)\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n0.4x = 0.25x + 150\n\nSubtracting 0.25x from both sides:\n\n0.15x = 150\n\nDividing both sides by 0.15:\n\nx = 1000\n\nSo Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was $1000.\n\nFinal Answer: 1000"

There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?\n\nInference: Mark has 10 yellow flowers. There are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers, which means the number of purple flowers is 10 + (80% of 10) = 10 + (0.8 * 10) = 10 + 8 = 18. So, there are 18 purple flowers. The total number of yellow and purple flowers is 10 + 18 = 28. Since there are 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers, the number of green flowers is 0.25 * 28 = 7.

Let's find the number of people on the first ship it ate. Since each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship, we can set up an equation:\n\n2^x = 847\n\nwhere x is the number of ships eaten by the monster.\n\nTo solve for x, we can take the logarithm of both sides:\n\nlog(2^x) = log(847)\n\nx = log(847) / log(2)\n\nx \u2248 9.5\n\nSince you can't have a fraction of a ship, we round down to the nearest whole number. The monster has eaten 9 ships in 300 years.\n\nThe first ship it ate was 100 years ago. Since the monster eats a ship every 100 years, the first ship it ate was 100 years ago. Let's call the number of people on the first ship \"x\". The number of people on the second ship is twice x, the number of people on the third ship is four times x, and so on.\n\nThe total number of people eaten by the monster is the sum of the number of people on each ship:\n\nx + 2x + 4x +... + 2^9 x = 847\n\nWe can simplify this equation by noticing that the sum is a geometric series:\n\nx * (1 + 2 + 4 +... + 2^9) = 847\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we get:\n\nx * ((2^10 - 1) / (2 - 1)) = 847\n\nx * (2^10 - 1) = 847 * (2 - 1)\n\nx * (2^10 - 1) = 847 * 1\n\nx = 847 / (2^10 - 1)\n\nx \u2248 63.5\n\nRounding down to the nearest whole number, there were 63 people on the first ship the monster ate.\n\nFinal Answer: 63",

He also mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel. After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change.\n\nTobias saves $5 each month for 3 months, so he has a total of $5 * 3 = $15 saved up. He buys the shoes, which costs $95, and has $15 left over. So, he must have had $95 + $15 = $110 before buying the shoes.\n\nHe mows 4 lawns, earning $15 * 4 = $60. He also has some money left over, which is the $15 he has after buying the shoes. So, the total amount of money he has is $110 + $60 = $170.\n\nHe has $170 before buying the shoes and has $15 left over. So, the amount of money he made from shoveling driveways is $170 - $95 - $60 = $15. Since he charges $7 to shovel, he must have shoveled $15 / $7 = 2 driveways.\n\nFinal Answer: 2",

        "I'd be happy to help you solve the question using the same inference style and format as the examples above.\n\nInference: Jasper buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10, which means each pound of cheddar cheese costs $10 / 2 = $5. He also buys a pound of cream cheese that costs half the price of the cheddar cheese, which is $5 / 2 = $2.50. Additionally, he buys a pack of cold cuts that costs twice the price of the cheddar cheese, which is $10 * 2 = $20.\n\nTo find the total cost of the ingredients, we add the cost of the cheddar cheese, cream cheese, and cold cuts:\n\n$10 (cheddar cheese) + $2.50 (cream cheese) + $20 (cold cuts) = $32.50\n\nFinal Answer: $32.50",
        "Here's the solution:\n\nInference: Joy can read 8 pages in 20 minutes, which means she reads 8 pages / 20 minutes = 0.4 pages per minute. To find out how many pages she can read in an hour, we multiply her reading rate by 60 minutes: 0.4 pages/minute * 60 minutes = 24 pages per hour. To read 120 pages, she will need 120 pages / 24 pages per hour = 5 hours.\n\nFinal Answer: 5",
        "Here's the solution to the question:\n\nInference: James creates a movie for $2000. Each DVD costs $6 to make, and he sells it for 2.5 times that much, which is 2.5 * 6 = $15. He sells 500 movies a day for 5 days a week, which means he sells 500 * 5 = 2500 movies per week. Since he wants to find out the profit in 20 weeks, we first need to calculate the total number of movies he sells in 20 weeks: 2500 * 20 = 50,000 movies.\n\nThe cost of making each DVD is $6, so the total cost of making 50,000 DVDs is 50,000 * 6 = $300,000. The revenue from selling each DVD is $15, so the total revenue from selling 50,000 DVDs is 50,000 * 15 = $750,000. The profit is the revenue minus the cost, which is $750,000 - $300,000 = $450,000.\n\nFinal Answer: 450,000",
        "Here's the solution:\n\nInference: The profit from the business transaction is shared between Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5. This means that for every 2 parts that Mike gets, Johnson gets 5 parts. Since Johnson got $2500, we can set up a proportion to find out how much Mike got:\n\n(2/5) = (x/2500)\n\nWhere x is the amount Mike got. Cross-multiplying, we get:\n\n2x = 2500 * (2/5)\n2x = 1000\nx = 500\n\nSo Mike got $500. He spent some of his share on a shirt that costs $200, so he has $500 - $200 left:\n\n$500 - $200 = $300\n\nFinal Answer: 300",

He also rides his bike to and from work for 1 hour each day, which is a total of 2 hours per day. He does this for 3 days a week while walking and 2 days a week while biking.\n\nTo calculate the total hours Roque spends commuting per week, we multiply the number of hours he spends walking per day by the number of days he walks:\n\n4 hours/day * 3 days = 12 hours\n\nAnd we multiply the number of hours he spends biking per day by the number of days he bikes:\n\n2 hours/day * 2 days = 4 hours\n\nAdding both totals together gives us:\n\n12 hours (walking) + 4 hours (biking) = 16 hours\n\nFinal Answer: 16",
        "Here's the solution:\n\nInference: Tim rides his bike back and forth to work for each of his 5 workdays, and his work is 20 miles away. This means he travels a total distance of 20 miles x 2 (there and back) = 40 miles each day. Since he does this for 5 days, his total workweek distance is 40 miles/day * 5 days = 200 miles.\n\nHe also goes for a weekend bike ride of 200 miles. To find the total distance he bikes in a week, we add his workweek distance to his weekend ride: 200 miles (workweek) + 200 miles (weekend) = 400 miles.\n\nSince Tim bikes at 25 mph, we can calculate the time he spends biking by dividing the total distance by his speed: 400 miles / 25 mph = 16 hours.\n\nFinal Answer: 16",

To find the number of files he deleted, we multiply 800 by 70% (or 0.7): 800 * 0.7 = 560 files. So, he was left with 800 - 560 = 240 files.\n\nHe then downloaded 400 more files, but again realized that 3/5 of them were irrelevant. To find the number of irrelevant files, we multiply 400 by 3/5 (or 0.6): 400 * 0.6 = 240 files. So, he was left with 400 - 240 = 160 files that were valuable.\n\nIn total, Brennan was left with the 240 files he had remaining after the first round of deleting, plus the 160 files he downloaded in the second round but found to be valuable: 240 + 160 = 400 files.\n\nFinal Answer: 400",

        "I'd be happy to help!\n\nInference: Mrs. Snyder's rent and utilities used to be 40% of her monthly income. After her salary increase, her rent and utilities are now 25% of her monthly income. This means that the percentage increase in her salary must have been enough to reduce the percentage of her income spent on rent and utilities by 15% (40% - 25%).\n\nLet's call her previous monthly income \"x\". Then, 0.4x was the amount she spent on rent and utilities before the salary increase.\n\nAfter the salary increase, her rent and utilities are 25% of her new monthly income, which is x + $600. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n0.25(x + 600) = 0.4x\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n0.25x + 150 = 0.4x\n\nSubtracting 0.25x from both sides gives:\n\n150 = 0.15x\n\nDividing both sides by 0.15 gives:\n\nx = 1000\n\nSo, Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was $1000.\n\nFinal Answer: $1000"

        "Here's the solution:\n\nInference: Since the monster consumes a ship every hundred years, it has consumed 847 people over a period of 300 years. This means that the number of times the monster has consumed a ship is 847 / 100 = 8.4 (round down to 8, since you can't have a fraction of a ship).\n\nThis means that the monster has consumed 8 ships over the 300-year period. Since each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship, we can set up a formula to represent the number of people on each ship:\n\nLet x be the number of people on the first ship. Then, the number of people on the second ship is 2x, the number of people on the third ship is 2(2x) = 4x, and so on.\n\nWe know that the total number of people consumed by the monster is 847. We can set up an equation to represent this:\n\nx + 2x + 4x +... + 2^8x = 847\n\nThis is a geometric series with first term x and common ratio 2. The sum of a geometric series is given by:\n\nSum = x(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nwhere r is the common ratio and n is the number of terms. In this case, r = 2 and n = 8.\n\nSubstituting these values, we get:\n\n847 = x(1 - 2^8) / (1 - 2)\n847 = x(1 - 256) / (-1)\n847 = x(-255) / (-1)\n847 = 255x\n\nDividing both sides by 255, we get:\n\nx = 847 / 255\nx = 3.33 (round down to 3, since you can't have a fraction of a person)\n\nTherefore, there were 3 people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years.\n\nFinal Answer: 3.0",

He gets a $5 allowance a month. He also mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel. After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change. If he mows 4 lawns, we need to determine how many driveways he shoveled to get a total of $15 in change.\n\nStep 1: Calculate Tobias's total monthly allowance for three months:\nTobias gets a $5 allowance a month, so for three months, he gets:\n$5/month * 3 months = $15\n\nStep 2: Calculate Tobias's total earnings from mowing lawns:\nTobias mows 4 lawns, and he charges $15 per lawn. Calculate his total earnings:\n$15/lawn * 4 lawns = $60\n\nStep 3: Calculate Tobias's total earnings from shoveling driveways:\nLet's call the number of driveways he shoveled \"x\". He charges $7 per driveway, so his total earnings from shoveling are:\n$7/drive * x drives = $7x\n\nStep 4: Calculate Tobias's total savings before buying the shoes:\nTobias gets $15 allowance and earns $60 from mowing lawns. His total savings before buying the shoes are:\n$15 (allowance) + $60 (mowing lawns) = $75\n\nStep 5: Calculate Tobias's total savings after buying the shoes:\nTobias buys the shoes for $95, leaving him with:\n$75 (total savings) - $95 (shoes) = -$20 (he is short $20)\n\nStep 6: Calculate the total change he has:\nTobias has $15 in change after buying the shoes. This means he must have earned an additional $20 to make up for the $20 he was short. This is from shoveling driveways:\n$20 (additional earnings) = $7x (earnings from shoveling)\nDivide both sides by $7:\n$x = $20 / $7 = 2.86 drives (round up to 3 drives, since you can't shovel a fraction of a drive)\n\nFinal Answer: 3",

Since the ratio is 2:5, Mike's share is 2 parts out of the total 7 parts. We can find Mike's share by multiplying the total profit by the ratio:\n\nMike's share = 2 parts x $500\n= $1000\n\nAfter spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will be left with:\n\n$1000 - $200 = $800\n\nFinal Answer: 800",

Let's start by dividing the total number of people eaten by the monster (847) by 3, since the monster eats a ship every 100 years, and there are 3 hundred-year periods.\n\n847 \u00f7 3 = 282.33\n\nThis means that the monster eats approximately 282 people per 100-year period. Since each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship, we can set up an equation to represent the number of people on each ship:\n\nLet x be the number of people on the first ship.\n\nThe number of people on the second ship is twice the number of people on the first ship, so it's 2x.\n\nThe number of people on the third ship is twice the number of people on the second ship, so it's 2(2x) = 4x.\n\nThe total number of people eaten by the monster is the sum of the number of people on each ship: x + 2x + 4x = 7x.\n\nWe know that the total number of people eaten by the monster is 282, so we can set up the equation:\n\n7x = 282\n\nTo solve for x, we can divide both sides by 7:\n\nx = 282 \u00f7 7\nx = 40.29\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the number of people on the first ship is approximately 40.\n\nFinal Answer: 40",
        "Here's the solution:\n\nInference: Tobias is buying a new pair of shoes that costs $95. He has been saving up his money each month for the past three months. He gets a $5 allowance a month. He also mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel. After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change. To find out how much he saved up, we subtract the cost of the shoes from the amount of change he has: $15 (change) - $95 (shoes) = -$80. This means he didn't have enough money to buy the shoes initially, so he must have earned some money from mowing lawns and shoveling driveways.\n\nLet's calculate the total amount he earned from mowing lawns: 4 lawns * $15/lawn = $60.\n\nSince he has $15 in change after buying the shoes, we know he must have earned at least $15 from shoveling driveways. We can set up an equation to represent the situation: $60 (earned from mowing) + $7x (earned from shoveling) = $15 (change) + $5 (allowance) * 3 (months) = $30.\n\nSolving for x, we get: $7x = $30 - $60 = -$30. x = -$30 / $7 = -4.33. Since you can't shovel a fraction of a driveway, we round down to the nearest whole number. Tobias shovelled 4 driveways.\n\nFinal Answer: 4",

He also mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel. After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how much Tobias has saved up in three months:\n3 months * $5 allowance per month = $15\n\nHe also earns money by mowing lawns and shoveling driveways. He mows 4 lawns, so he earns:\n4 lawns * $15 per lawn = $60\n\nAfter buying the shoes, he has $15 in change, which means he had $95 + $15 = $110 before buying the shoes. This is the total amount of money he has earned, including his savings and lawn/shovel earnings.\n\nLet's set up an equation to represent the total amount of money Tobias has:\n$15 (savings) + $60 (lawn earnings) + x (shovel earnings) = $110\n\nWhere x is the amount of money he earned from shoveling driveways.\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n$15 + $60 + x = $110\n\nSubtracting $75 from both sides:\nx = $110 - $75\nx = $35\n\nSo, Tobias earned $35 from shoveling driveways.",

To find out how many minutes it takes her to read 120 pages, we can divide the number of pages by her reading rate per minute: 120 pages / 0.4 pages per minute = 300 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to hours by dividing by 60: 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours.\n\nFinal Answer: 5.0",
        "Here's the solution:\n\nInference: James makes a movie for $2000, and each DVD costs $6 to make. He sells each DVD for 2.5 times the cost, which is 2.5 x $6 = $15. To find the profit per DVD, we subtract the cost from the selling price: $15 - $6 = $9. Since James sells 500 movies a day for 5 days a week, that's a total of 500 x 5 = 2500 DVDs sold per week. In 20 weeks, he sells 2500 x 20 = 50,000 DVDs. Since each DVD has a profit of $9, the total profit is 50,000 x $9 = $450,000.\n\nFinal Answer: 450000.0",
        "Here's the solution:\n\nInference: Since the profit is shared in the ratio 2:5, and Johnson got $2500, we can set up an equation to find Mike's share. Let's say Mike's share is 2x and Johnson's share is 5x. We know that 5x = 2500, so x = 2500/5 = 500. This means Mike's share is 2x = 2(500) = 1000. After spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200, Mike will be left with 1000 - 200 = 800.\n\nFinal Answer: 800.0",
        "Here's the solution:\n\nInference: Initially, there are 26 pink hard hats, 15 green hard hats, and 24 yellow hard hats. Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats, leaving 26 - 4 = 22 pink hard hats. John takes away 6 pink hard hats, leaving 22 - 6 = 16 pink hard hats. John also takes away twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats he removed, which is 2 * 6 = 12 green hard hats. So, there are 15 - 12 = 3 green hard hats left. The number of yellow hard hats remains the same, which is 24. To find the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck, we add the remaining pink, green, and yellow hard hats: 16 + 3 + 24 = 43.\n\nFinal Answer: 43.0",
        "Here's the solution to the question:\n\nInference: Roque walks to and from work three times a week, which means he walks for a total of 2 hours * 2 (to and from) * 3 times = 12 hours per week. He also rides his bike to and from work twice a week, which is 1 hour * 2 (to and from) * 2 times = 4 hours per week. To find the total hours he takes to get to and from work a week with walking and biking, we add the hours spent walking and biking: 12 hours + 4 hours = 16 hours.\n\nFinal Answer: 16.0",
        "Here's the solution:\n\nInference: Tim bikes back and forth to work each day, which means he bikes 20 miles there and 20 miles back, for a total of 40 miles per day. Since he does this for 5 workdays, he bikes a total of 40 x 5 = 200 miles for work. Additionally, he goes for a weekend bike ride of 200 miles. To find the total miles he bikes in a week, we add the miles for work and the weekend ride, which gives us 200 + 200 = 400 miles. Since he bikes at a speed of 25 mph, we can find the total time he spends biking by dividing the total miles by his speed. This gives us 400 miles / 25 mph = 16 hours.\n\nFinal Answer: 16.0",
        "Inference: Bella purchased 11 snowflake stamps. She bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, which means she bought 11 + 9 = 20 truck stamps. Since she bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, she bought 20 - 13 = 7 rose stamps. To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps: 11 + 20 + 7 = 38.\n\nFinal Answer: 38.0",
        "Here's the solution:\n\nInference: Each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day. Since there are 6 jaguars, the total number of snakes eaten is 6 x 5 = 30 snakes per day. Each snake eats 3 birds per day, so the total number of birds eaten is 30 x 3 = 90 birds per day. Each bird eats 12 beetles per day, so the total number of beetles eaten is 90 x 12 = 1080 beetles per day.\n\nFinal Answer: 1080.0",
        "Here's the solution to the question:\n\nInference: Bobbie's last name is twice the length of Jamie's last name, which is \"Grey\". This means Bobbie's last name has 6 letters (2 x 3). Samantha's last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie's, so it has 6 - 3 = 3 letters. Since Bobbie's last name has 6 letters, Samantha's last name has 3 letters.\n\nFinal Answer: 3",
        "Here's the solution:\n\nInference: Ann spent a total of $75 on 5 pairs of shorts for $7 each, 2 pairs of shoes for $10 each, and 4 tops. The total cost of the shorts is 5 x $7 = $35, and the total cost of the shoes is 2 x $10 = $20. Adding these amounts together, we get $35 + $20 = $55. This leaves $75 - $55 = $20 for the 4 tops. To find the cost of each top, we divide the remaining amount by the number of tops: $20 \u00f7 4 = $5.\n\nFinal Answer: 5.0",
        "Here's the solution to the question:\n\nInference: Mary initially had a credit of $100, which she spent in full. She paid $15 on Tuesday and $23 on Thursday, which means she has already paid a total of $15 + $23 = $38. To find out how much credit she still needs to pay, we subtract the amount she has already paid from the initial credit limit. \n\nFinal Answer: 62.0",
        "Here's the solution to the problem:\n\nInference: Ralph initially loaded the machine with 175 tennis balls. Out of the first 100 balls, he hit 2/5 of them, which is 2/5 * 100 = 40 balls. He didn't hit the remaining 100 - 40 = 60 balls. Moving on to the next 75 balls, he hit 1/3 of them, which is 1/3 * 75 = 25 balls. He didn't hit the remaining 75 - 25 = 50 balls. To find out how many balls he didn't hit in total, we add the number of balls he didn't hit in both parts: 60 + 50 = 110 balls.\n\nFinal Answer: 110.0",
        "Here's the solution:\n\nInference: Jack collects 2 liters of seawater, which is 2000 milliliters (since there are 1000 milliliters in a liter). The seawater is 20% salt, which means that 20% of the total volume is salt. To find the volume of salt, we multiply the total volume by the percentage of salt. In this case, we multiply 2000 milliliters by 0.20, which gives us 400 milliliters of salt.\n\nFinal Answer: 400.0",
        "Here's the solution to the question:\n\nInference: Brennan started with 800 files, and then deleted 70% of them, which is 0.7 times 800, or 560 files. So, he was left with 800 - 560 = 240 files. He then downloaded 400 more files, but deleted 3/5 of them, which is 0.6 times 400, or 240 files. This means he deleted 240 files from the 400 he downloaded, leaving him with 160 files. To find the total number of valuable files, we add the remaining files from the first round (240) to the remaining files from the second round (160), which equals 400 files.\n\nFinal Answer: 400.0",
        "Here's the solution to the question:\n\nInference: There are 4 houses with 3 gnomes each, so the total number of gnomes in these 4 houses is 4 x 3 = 12. Since there are a total of 20 gnomes on the street, the remaining gnomes must be in the 5th house. The difference between the total number of gnomes and the number of gnomes in the first 4 houses is 20 - 12 = 8. Therefore, the 5th house has 8 gnomes.\n\nFinal Answer: 8.0",
        "Here's the solution to the problem:\n\nInference: Mrs. Snyder's rent and utilities used to take up 40% of her monthly income. After her salary increase, rent and utilities now take up 25% of her monthly income. The increase in her salary is $600, which reduced the percentage of her income spent on rent and utilities from 40% to 25%. This means that the $600 increase is equivalent to the difference between 40% and 25% of her monthly income. To find the original monthly income, we can set up an equation:\n\n40% of original income - 25% of original income = $600\n\nWe can simplify the equation by converting the percentages to decimals:\n\n0.4(original income) - 0.25(original income) = $600\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n0.15(original income) = $600\n\nDivide both sides by 0.15:\n\nOriginal income = $600 / 0.15\nOriginal income = $4000\n\nFinal Answer: $4000.0"
