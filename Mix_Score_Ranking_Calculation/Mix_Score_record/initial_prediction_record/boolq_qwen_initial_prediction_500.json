It had a second season in 2014.\n3. A third season premiered in 2015.\n4. On July 23, 2015, Starz announced that the third season would be the show's last.\n5. The creator, Goyer, left it open for a potential miniseries return.\n\nGiven that the third season was explicitly stated to be the last, and there is no official announcement of a fourth season, it is highly unlikely that a fourth season will be produced. The possibility of a miniseries return, however, is still open but not confirmed.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "Inference: The federal courts are composed of multiple levels, including the Supreme Court of the United States, which is described as the court of last resort.

        "Inference: The context provided mentions that the Milwaukee Bucks have won one league title in 1971. However, a league title and a championship are not always the same thing. In the context of the NBA, a championship is typically referred to as an NBA title, which is awarded at the end of each NBA season after a playoff series. The context does not explicitly state that the league title in 1971 is equivalent to an NBA championship.

The tilt gradually increased until the structure was stabilized (and the tilt partially corrected) by efforts in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the tower was not built leaning, but it developed a tilt during its construction and continued to lean as it was being built.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "To infer whether \"Fool's Gold\" is a true story, we need to consider the typical characteristics of films in this genre. Adventure-romance films, especially those involving lost treasures, are usually fictional stories created for entertainment purposes.

Stainless steel can sometimes be ferrous, but it depends on the type.\n\n2. **Types of Stainless Steel**: Not all stainless steel is ferrous. Some types of stainless steel, particularly those with a high nickel content, are non-ferrous and thus do not interact with the magnetic field in the same way as ferrous metals. Therefore, they cannot produce the concentrated current needed for effective heating on an induction cooktop.\n\n3. **All Metal Induction Tops**: These use much higher frequencies to overcome the magnetic field limitations of non-ferrous metals. However, this is a specific feature and not the norm for most induction cooktops.\n\n4. **Conventional Hotplate Alternative**: If a vessel does not work with the magnetic field, a metal disk can be used as a conventional hotplate to heat the vessel.\n\nFrom this information, we can infer that not all stainless steel can be used on induction cooktops, particularly those with a high nickel content that are non-ferrous.\n\nFinal Answer: False",

Corn is also relatively heavy for its volume.\n\n2. **Structure of a Silo**: A silo is a vertical cylindrical structure designed to store large quantities of grain. It typically has a smooth, vertical surface, which helps the grain pack tightly.\n\n3. **Mechanism of Entrapment**: When a person enters a pile of corn, the grain can shift and collapse, burying the person. This is due to the granular nature of the corn and the weight of the corn above the person.\n\nGiven these factors, a person can indeed sink or be buried in a corn silo due to the weight and granular properties of the corn. The likelihood of sinking increases as more corn is added above the person.\n\nFinal Answer: True",

Attempts to extend the Standard Model or other quantum field theories by adding gravitons run into serious theoretical difficulties at energies close to or above the Planck scale.\n3. These difficulties are due to infinities arising from quantum effects, which indicate that gravitation is not renormalizable.\n4. The Standard Model is a quantum field theory that describes the electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions, but it does not include gravity.\n\nGiven these points, it is clear that the graviton, which is a hypothetical particle that mediates the force of gravity, is not part of the Standard Model. The Standard Model does not incorporate gravity due to the theoretical challenges mentioned.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "Let's break down the information provided:\n\n1. In the past, schools in Wales have taken a half-day holiday for Saint David's Day, and this practice continues in some parts of Wales.\n2. The National Assembly for Wales voted unanimously to make Saint David's Day a public holiday in 2000.\n3. A poll in 2006 showed strong support for making it a bank holiday.\n4. A petition in 2007 to make Saint David's Day a bank holiday was rejected by the office of the British Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nFrom these points, we can infer that while there has been support and even a formal vote to make Saint David's Day a public holiday, it has not been implemented as a bank holiday. The rejection of the petition by the Prime Minister's office indicates that it has not been adopted as a bank holiday.\n\nFinal Answer: False",

        "To determine if you can have a skunk as a pet in Canada, let's analyze the given context step by step:\n\n1. **USDA-certified breeder**: Canadian pet skunks must be purchased from a USDA-certified breeder in the United States. This implies that skunks are not bred in Canada for pet trade.\n\n2. **Import permit**: An import permit is required from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to bring the skunk into the country. This suggests that the process is regulated and controlled.\n\n3. **Spaying/Neutering and Microchipping**: The skunk must be spayed or neutered and receive a microchip implant or tattoo. This indicates that the skunk must undergo certain procedures before being allowed into the country.\n\n4. **Vet check fee**: A vet check fee must be paid. This fee is likely associated with the health certification of the skunk.\n\n5. **Illegal to keep striped skunks**: It is explicitly stated that it is illegal to keep striped skunks as pets in Canada.\n\nGiven these points, we can infer that while it is possible to bring a skunk into Canada from the United States under specific conditions, it is not generally legal to keep a skunk as a pet in Canada. The legality is contingent on the type of skunk (likely excluding striped skunks) and the stringent conditions that must be met.\n\nFinal Answer: False",

The passage mentions that in 1964, the Razorbacks were the only team to go through the regular season and a bowl game undefeated and were awarded the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) National Championship.\n2. However, the FWAA National Championship is not always recognized as the official NCAA national championship.\n3. The passage does not provide any information about other potential national championships won by the Razorbacks.\n\nGiven that the only national championship mentioned is the FWAA National Championship from 1964, and it is not always considered the official NCAA national championship, we need to consider if there are any other official national championships won by the Razorbacks.\n\nFinal Answer: False",

        "Based on the context provided, Puerto Rico is subject to U.S. federal law due to its status as a territory under the territorial clause of Article IV, sec. 3, of the U.S. Constitution. The Federal Relations Act of 1950 specifically states that all federal laws that are not locally inapplicable are automatically the law of the land in Puerto Rico. Only two district court decisions have held that a particular federal law is inapplicable to Puerto Rico, but these decisions were later vacated on appeal.

        "To determine if one point can be in two different planes, let's analyze the given context and the general properties of planes in space.\n\n1. **Understanding Planes in Space:**\n   - A plane in three-dimensional space can be defined by a point and a normal vector, or by a general equation \\(Ax + By + Cz = D\\).\n   - Two planes can intersect in a line, be parallel (and thus not intersect), or coincide (be the same plane).\n\n2. **Intersection of Planes:**\n   - If two planes intersect, they do so along a line. This means that every point on this line is common to both planes.\n   - If two planes are parallel, they do not share any points.\n   - If two planes coincide, every point on one plane is also on the other plane.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given the above, a point can indeed be in two different planes if those planes intersect at that point. If the planes are parallel or coincide, they share multiple points, but if they intersect, they share a line of points.\n\nTherefore, based on the properties of planes in space, a point can be in two different planes if those planes intersect.\n\nFinal Answer: True",

        "To determine if a set is an element of its power set, let's consider the definition of a power set. The power set of a set \\( S \\), denoted \\( P(S) \\), is the set of all subsets of \\( S \\). This includes the empty set and \\( S \\) itself.\n\nFor any set \\( S \\), each subset of \\( S \\) is an element of \\( P(S) \\). However, \\( S \\) itself is a subset of \\( S \\), and therefore \\( S \\) is an element of \\( P(S) \\). But \\( S \\) is not a subset of an element of \\( S \\); rather, it is an element of \\( S \\) itself.\n\nTo clarify, if \\( x \\) is an element of \\( S \\), then \\( \\{x\\} \\) is a subset of \\( S \\) and an element of \\( P(S) \\). However, \\( S \\) is not an element of itself in the context of being a subset of another set; it is the set itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that every element of \\( S \\) is an element of \\( P(S) \\) when considered as a subset, but \\( S \\) itself is an element of \\( P(S) \\), not an element of an element of \\( P(S) \\).\n\nFinal Answer: False",

        "Based on the given context, it is possible to heat water above its boiling point under certain conditions. Specifically, water can be heated to temperatures above 100 \u00b0C (212 \u00b0F) without boiling if it is under pressure. This is because the boiling point of water increases with pressure, allowing the water to remain in a liquid state even at temperatures that would normally cause it to boil at atmospheric pressure.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "Based on the given context, Station 19 is described as the second spin-off to Grey's Anatomy. This indicates that there is indeed a spin-off of Grey's Anatomy.\n\nFinal Answer: True",

It also mentions that it is generally considered the largest freshwater lake in the world by surface area. However, it does not provide any direct information about Lake Superior being the second largest lake in the world.\n\nTo determine if Lake Superior is the second largest lake in the world, we would need to compare its size to other lakes globally. Based on the information provided, we cannot infer that Lake Superior is the second largest lake in the world.\n\nFinal Answer: False",

It does not indicate that a tornado is currently happening, but rather that the conditions are right for one to potentially form.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "To infer whether all bay tree leaves can be used in cooking, we need to consider the information provided. The context mentions that bay leaves are safe to eat and can be used in cooking, but it also notes that they remain stiff after thorough cooking and can pose a risk if swallowed whole or in large pieces. The text specifically recommends removing the leaves before serving, especially if they have not been ground, to avoid the risk of harm.\n\nGiven this information, we can infer that while bay leaves are generally safe to use in cooking, they should be removed from the food before serving to minimize the risk of harm. This implies that not all parts of the bay tree, particularly whole or large pieces, are suitable for direct consumption after cooking.\n\nFinal Answer: False",

        "Inference: The back of the neck is mentioned as a sensitive area that can be stimulated by licking, kissing, or light caressing. It is also noted that some people enjoy being bitten gently in this area, which can result in the formation of a \"hickey\" or \"love-bite.\" These details suggest that the back of the neck is an area that can evoke strong reactions and pleasure, which is characteristic of an erogenous zone.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "Based on the given context, Jersey operates its own postal administration independently of the UK's Royal Mail since 1969. It has its own postage stamps that are valid only within Jersey. Therefore, Jersey is not part of the UK Royal Mail.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "To determine if the Isle of Man is part of Great Britain, let's analyze the given context:\n\n1. The Isle of Man is described as a \"self-governing British Crown dependency.\"\n2. It is located in the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Ireland.\n3. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, who holds the title of Lord of Mann.\n4. Defence is the responsibility of the United Kingdom.\n\nFrom these points, we can infer that while the Isle of Man is under the sovereignty of the British Crown, it is not part of Great Britain. It has its own local government and is not directly governed by the British government in the same way as parts of Great Britain are.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "To determine if Mount Whitney can be seen from Dante's View in Death Valley, we need to consider the distance and clarity required to see such a distant and high point.\n\n1. **Distance**: Mount Whitney is approximately 110 miles (177 km) from Death Valley. This is a significant distance.\n2. **Clarity**: On very clear days, distant objects can be seen more clearly due to reduced atmospheric distortion and scattering.\n\nGiven that the context mentions that on very clear days, the highest and lowest points in the contiguous 48 states can be seen, it implies that under ideal conditions, such a distant and high peak like Mount Whitney could be visible.\n\n**Final Answer: True**",
        "Inference: Based on the information provided, the Maze Runner film series concluded with the release of the third film, Maze Runner: The Death Cure, on January 26, 2018. There is no mention of any plans or announcements for a sequel to the series.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "To infer whether you can get 2 Yahtzees in a game, let's break down the rules and scenarios:\n\n1. **Yahtzee Bonus Rule**: A Yahtzee bonus is awarded if you throw a Yahtzee and have already filled the Yahtzee box with a score of 50. In this case, you get an extra 100 points.\n2. **No Bonus for Zero Score**: If you throw a Yahtzee and the Yahtzee box already has a score of 0, you do not get a Yahtzee bonus.\n\nGiven these rules, it is possible to get a Yahtzee bonus in a game if you manage to have the Yahtzee box filled with 50 points before throwing another Yahtzee. However, you can only get one Yahtzee bonus per game because once the Yahtzee box has 50 points, any subsequent Yahtzees will not trigger an additional bonus.\n\nTherefore, you can throw a Yahtzee multiple times, but you can only get one Yahtzee bonus.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "Inference: The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that no person shall be compelled to be a witness against themselves. This means that individuals have the right to not testify against themselves if they choose not to. However, the Constitution does not explicitly state \"the right to remain silent.\" The right to remain silent is a derived concept from the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination.\n\nFinal Answer: False",

        "First, let's analyze the information given:\n- West Edmonton Mall is the largest shopping mall in North America.\n- It is also the tenth largest in the world.\n- It was the world's largest mall until 2004.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that while West Edmonton Mall was once the largest mall in the world, it is not currently the largest mall in the world. The statement that it is the largest mall in the world is only true up to a certain point in time and is not accurate in the present.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "In the given context, symbiotic relationships are described as interactions between different organisms. The example provided mentions Zoamastogopera, which are bacteria living in the stomach of termites and aiding in the digestion of cellulose. This example clearly shows that bacteria (microbes) can have symbiotic relationships with other organisms.\n\nGiven that bacteria are themselves microbes, it logically follows that microbes can indeed have symbiotic relationships with other microbes. This is a common phenomenon in nature, where different microbial species can live in symbiosis, such as in the human gut where various bacteria coexist and interact beneficially.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "Inference: The information provided states that only two participants, Yoenis C\u00e9spedes and Giancarlo Stanton, have won the Home Run Derby without being selected to the All-Star game itself.

        "In the given context, a learner's permit, learner's license, or provisional license are all mentioned as terms for a restricted license given to a person learning to drive. The context states that these permits are usually obtained after passing a written test and are a step towards getting a full driver's license. \n\nGiven this information, a provisional license is essentially the same as a learner's permit or learner's license, as they all refer to the same type of restricted driving license.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "To determine if Alpha Centauri can be seen without a telescope, we need to consider its apparent visual magnitude. The context states that Alpha Centauri has an apparent visual magnitude of \u22120.27. Stars with a magnitude of 6 or lower are generally visible to the naked eye under clear, dark skies. Since \u22120.27 is well below 6, it indicates that Alpha Centauri is a very bright star and can be seen without a telescope.\n\nFinal Answer: True",

        "To determine if someone born on a military base can be president, we need to consider the criteria for natural-born citizenship in the United States. According to the U.S. Constitution, a person must be a \"natural-born citizen\" to be eligible for the presidency. \n\nNatural-born citizenship is typically established by being born on U.S. soil, with some exceptions, such as the provisions in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1403, which confers citizenship on individuals born in specific territories or to U.S. citizen parents employed by the U.S. government.\n\nGiven the information provided, individuals born on a military base, such as the Panama Canal Zone, could potentially be considered natural-born citizens under the provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1403. This statute retroactively conferred citizenship on individuals born in the Canal Zone on or after February 26, 1904, and on individuals born in the Republic of Panama on or after that date who had at least one U.S. citizen parent employed by the U.S. government or the Panama Railway Company.\n\nTherefore, the inference is that someone born on a military base, such as the Panama Canal Zone, could be eligible for the presidency if they meet the criteria set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1403.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "To checkmate with two bishops and a king, we need to consider the constraints and capabilities of these pieces. Bishops move diagonally and can control a large part of the board, but they cannot attack each other's squares (they are confined to the same color). The king can move to any adjacent square, but its primary role in checkmate is to assist in controlling squares and preventing the opponent's king from escaping.\n\nHere's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. **Control of the Board**: Two bishops can control the entire board if they are on different colored squares. However, they cannot directly attack each other's squares, which limits their combined attacking power.\n\n2. **Checkmate Conditions**: For checkmate, the opponent's king must be in a position where it is under attack and has no legal moves to escape. This typically requires a piece (or pieces) to be in a position to deliver checkmate and the king to be unable to move to a safe square.\n\n3. **King's Role**: The king can move to squares controlled by the bishops, but it cannot directly participate in delivering checkmate. Instead, it can be used to block or create a stalemate scenario, which is not desirable for checkmate.\n\n4. **Two Bishops' Limitations**: With two bishops, the king can often find a square to escape to, especially if the bishops are not correctly positioned to control all possible escape squares. The king can also move to squares where the bishops cannot checkmate directly.\n\nGiven these points, it is generally not possible to force checkmate with just two bishops and a king against a lone king. The king can usually find a safe square to move to, preventing checkmate.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "Inference: Given the context, a person who is 18 years old is considered an adult in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Since there is no federal law regulating the practice of tattooing, and the statutory laws in all states require that a person receiving a tattoo must be 18 years of age or older, it can be inferred that a 18-year-old can get a tattoo without any additional permission.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "Based on the context provided, there are indeed two versions of Ren & Stimpy. The original version aired on Nickelodeon, which was more suitable for children, and the \"Adult Party Cartoon\" version, which is an \"extreme\" revamp aimed at an adult audience and is significantly more vulgar and inappropriate than the original.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "To infer whether the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is a government agency, let's consider the information provided:\n\n1. It is part of the Federal Reserve System, which is a network of 12 regional Reserve Banks.\n2. It is responsible for implementing monetary policy and supervising financial institutions.\n3. It operates within the framework of the U.S. government's monetary policy and financial regulatory system.\n\nGiven these points, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York operates under the authority of the U.S. government and is responsible for significant financial regulatory and monetary policy functions. However, it is important to note that the Federal Reserve is a unique public-private partnership. While it is not a traditional government agency in the sense of being solely composed of government employees, it is a government-created entity with a mandate from the U.S. government.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "Inference: The octet rule primarily applies to main-group elements, specifically those in the second and third periods, such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and the halogens.

        "Based on the given context, New Jersey law restricts corporations to two retail distribution licenses for alcoholic beverages, which makes it impractical for chain stores to sell alcoholic beverages. Additionally, municipal ordinances further limit supermarket and convenience store chains from selling beer as they do in many other states. This suggests that grocery stores in New Jersey, which are often part of larger chains, are not typically allowed to sell beer.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "Inference: Fairmont Hotels & Resorts is described as a chain of luxury hotels. It has a significant number of properties (75) spread across multiple countries (24), indicating a chain structure.

        "Inference: According to the given context, a triangle's angles must sum to 180\u00b0. An obtuse angle is defined as an angle greater than 90\u00b0. If a triangle were to have more than one obtuse angle, the sum of just those two angles would be greater than 180\u00b0, which is not possible since the sum of all three angles in a triangle must equal exactly 180\u00b0. Therefore, a triangle cannot have more than one obtuse angle.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "To determine if One World Trade Center is taller than the Empire State Building, we need to compare their heights.\n\n- One World Trade Center's height is 1,776 feet (541 m).\n- The Empire State Building's height without the antenna is 1,250 feet (381 m). With the antenna, it reaches 1,454 feet (443 m).\n\nSince 1,776 feet is greater than both 1,250 feet and 1,454 feet, One World Trade Center is indeed taller than the Empire State Building.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "To determine if the U.S. has ever gone to the World Cup, we need to analyze the provided information:\n\n1. The U.S. men's national soccer team has played in several World Cup finals.\n2. Their best result was in 1930 when they finished in third place.\n3. After 1950, they were absent from the finals until 1990.\n4. The U.S. has participated in every World Cup since 1990 until they failed to qualify for the 2018 competition.\n\nGiven these points, it is clear that the U.S. has participated in multiple World Cups, including the initial appearance in 1930 and every World Cup from 1990 to 2018.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "In the context provided, running is described as a type of gait characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground (though there are exceptions).

        "To infer whether Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique are the same company, we need to look at the context provided:\n\n1. Est\u00e9e Lauder introduced a men's line called \"Skin Supplies for Men\" under the Clinique brand in 1976.\n2. Clinique products became available in the Soviet Union in 1981, indicating that Clinique was a recognized brand by then.\n\nFrom these points, it can be inferred that Clinique is a brand under the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Inc. The introduction of a men's line by Est\u00e9e Lauder under the Clinique brand and the global availability of Clinique products suggest a corporate relationship between the two.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "To infer whether Charlie from \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" is still alive, we need to consider the context provided and make logical deductions.\n\n1. **Context Provided**: Peter Gardner Ostrum played the role of Charlie Bucket in the 1971 film \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.\"\n2. **Actor's Age**: The actor was born on November 1, 1957. This means he was 14 years old when he played the role of Charlie Bucket.\n3. **Character's Age**: In the story, Charlie Bucket is a young boy, likely around the same age as the actor, which is approximately 12 years old.\n\nGiven that the film was made in 1971 and the actor was 14 at the time, we can assume the character Charlie Bucket is also around 12. Therefore, if the actor is still alive, we need to calculate his current age to determine if the character would still be alive.\n\n**Calculation**:\n- Current year: 2023\n- Actor's birth year: 1957\n- Actor's current age: 2023 - 1957 = 66 years old\n\nSince the actor is 66 years old in 2023, and he was 14 when he played the role of Charlie Bucket, we can infer that the character Charlie Bucket would be around 66 + 12 - 14 = 64 years old in 2023.\n\n**Final Answer: True**",
