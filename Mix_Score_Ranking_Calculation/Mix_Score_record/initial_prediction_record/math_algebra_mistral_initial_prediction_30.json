Y = X - 4\n\nSubstitute the expression for Y from equation 2 into equation 1: X + (X - 4) = 30\n\nSolve for X: X + X - 4 = 30 => 2X = 34 => X = 17\n\nNow that we have X, we can find Y using the expression for Y: Y = X - 4 = 17 - 4 = 13\n\nFinal Answer: The larger number is 17 and the smaller number is 13.",
