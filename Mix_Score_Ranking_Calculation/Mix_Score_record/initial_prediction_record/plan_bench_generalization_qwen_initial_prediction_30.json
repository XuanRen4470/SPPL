        "Let's analyze the initial conditions and the goal step by step to infer the correct sequence of actions.\n\n### Initial Conditions:\n- The red block is clear.\n- The orange block is clear.\n- The yellow block is clear.\n- The white block is clear.\n- The black block is clear.\n- The cyan block is clear.\n- The green block is clear.\n- The violet block is clear.\n- The silver block is clear.\n- The gold block is clear.\n- The hand is empty.\n- All blocks (red, orange, yellow, white, black, cyan, green, violet, silver, gold) are on the table.\n\n### Goal:\n- The red block is on top of the gold block.\n- The orange block is on top of the silver block.\n- The yellow block is on top of the orange block.\n- The white block is on top of the red block.\n- The black block is on top of the green block.\n- The green block is on top of the yellow block.\n- The violet block is on top of the white block.\n- The silver block is on top of the cyan block.\n- The gold block is on top of the black block.\n\n### Inference:\nTo achieve the goal, we need to build each stack in the correct order. We need to ensure that the blocks are stacked correctly and that each block is placed on a clear block. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Build the silver block stack:**\n   - Pick up the silver block.\n   - Stack the silver block on top of the cyan block.\n\n2. **Build the violet block stack:**\n   - Pick up the violet block.\n   - Stack the violet block on top of the white block.\n   - Pick up the white block.\n   - Stack the white block on top of the red block.\n   - Pick up the red block.\n   - Stack the red block on top of the black block.\n   - Pick up the black block.\n   - Stack the black block on top of the green block.\n   - Pick up the green block.\n   - Stack the green block on top of the yellow block.\n   - Pick up the yellow block.\n   - Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block.\n   - Pick up the orange block.\n   - Stack the orange block on top of the blue block.\n   - Pick up the blue block.\n   - Stack the blue block on top of the silver block.\n\n3. **Build the gold block stack:**\n   - Pick up the gold block.\n   - Stack the gold block on top of the black block.\n\n4. **Build the red block stack:**\n   - Pick up the red block.\n   - Stack the red block on top of the gold block.\n\n### Final Plan:\n1. Pick up the silver block.\n2. Stack the silver block on top of the cyan block.\n3. Pick up the violet block.\n4. Stack the violet block on top of the white block.\n5. Pick up the white block.\n6. Stack the white block on top of the red block.\n7. Pick up the red block.\n8. Stack the red block on top of the black block.\n9. Pick up the black block.\n10. Stack the black block on top of the green block.\n11. Pick up the green block.\n12. Stack the green block on top of the yellow block.\n13. Pick up the yellow block.\n14. Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block.\n15. Pick up the orange block.\n16. Stack the orange block on top of the blue block.\n17. Pick up the blue block.\n18. Stack the blue block on top of the silver block.\n19. Pick up the gold block.\n20. Stack the gold block on top of the black block.\n21. Pick up the red block.\n22. Stack the red block on top of the gold block.\n\n### Final Answer:\n1. Pick up the silver block.\n2. Stack the silver block on top of the cyan block.\n3. Pick up the violet block.\n4. Stack the violet block on top of the white block.\n5. Pick up the white block.\n6. Stack the white block on top of the red block.\n7. Pick up the red block.\n8. Stack the red block on top of the black block.\n9. Pick up the black block.\n10. Stack the black block on top of the green block.\n11. Pick up the green block.\n12. Stack the green block on top of the yellow block.\n13. Pick up the yellow block.\n14. Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block.\n15. Pick up the orange block.\n16. Stack the orange block on top of the blue block.\n17. Pick up the blue block.\n18. Stack the blue block on top of the silver block.\n19. Pick up the gold block.\n20. Stack the gold block"
