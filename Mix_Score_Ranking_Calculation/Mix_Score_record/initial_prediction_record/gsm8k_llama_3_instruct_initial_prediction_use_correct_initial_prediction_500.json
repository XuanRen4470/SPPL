He gave 4 to Todd, so he had x - 4 gumballs left.\n\nThen, he gave twice as many to Alisha as he had given to Todd, which is 2 \u00d7 4 = 8. So, he had x - 4 - 8 = x - 12 gumballs left.\n\nNext, he gave 5 less than four times as many to Bobby as he had given to Alisha. Since he gave 8 to Alisha, four times that is 4 \u00d7 8 = 32. 5 less than that is 32 - 5 = 27. So, he gave 27 to Bobby.\n\nAfter giving gumballs to Todd, Alisha, and Bobby, Hector had 6 gumballs remaining. Let's subtract the number of gumballs he gave away from the total:\n\nx - 4 - 8 - 27 = 6\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx - 39 = 6\n\nAdd 39 to both sides:\n\nx = 45\n\nSo, Hector purchased 45 gumballs.\n\nFinal Answer: 45",

Since the first tank is twice the size of the second tank, and the first tank has 48 gallons, the second tank must have half of that, or 24 gallons.\n\nSince the rule is one gallon of water per inch of fish, and the second tank has 24 gallons, it can hold 24-inch fish. However, Gail keeps 2-inch fish in the second tank, so it can hold 24/2 = 12 fish.\n\nThe first tank has 48 gallons and can hold 48-inch fish. However, Gail keeps 3-inch fish in the first tank, so it can hold 48/3 = 16 fish.\n\nIf one of the first tank fish eats another, there will be 15 fish in the first tank. Since the second tank has 12 fish, the difference is 15 - 12 = 3.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3.",

Toby knows that 25% of goldfish are at the surface, so if he counts 15 goldfish, 25% of them must be 15.\n\nTo find the total number of goldfish, we can set up an equation:\n\n25% of total = 15\n\nTo solve for the total, we can multiply both sides by 4 (since 25% is equal to 1/4):\n\nTotal = 15 x 4\nTotal = 60\n\nSo, there are a total of 60 goldfish in the pond. Since Toby can only see 15 of them, the rest must be below the surface. To find the number of goldfish below the surface, we can subtract the number of goldfish at the surface from the total:\n\nNumber of goldfish below the surface = Total - Number of goldfish at the surface\n= 60 - 15\n= 45\n\nFinal Answer: 45",
        "Let's break this problem down step by step!\n\nThe total weight of ground beef delivered by the three butchers is 100 pounds.\n\nThe first butcher delivered 10 packages, each weighing 4 pounds. So, the total weight delivered by the first butcher is:\n\n10 packages x 4 pounds/package = 40 pounds\n\nThe second butcher delivered 7 packages, each weighing 4 pounds. So, the total weight delivered by the second butcher is:\n\n7 packages x 4 pounds/package = 28 pounds\n\nNow, let's add the weights delivered by the first two butchers to get the total weight delivered so far:\n\n40 pounds + 28 pounds = 68 pounds\n\nSince the total weight delivered by all three butchers is 100 pounds, the weight delivered by the third butcher is:\n\n100 pounds - 68 pounds = 32 pounds\n\nSince each package weighs 4 pounds, the number of packages delivered by the third butcher is:\n\n32 pounds / 4 pounds/package = 8 packages\n\nFinal Answer: 8",

        "Let's break this down step by step!\n\nInitially, there were 18 students assigned to the minibus, and 8 of them were boys. To find the number of girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total:\n\n18 (total students) - 8 (boys) = 10 girls\n\nSince the number of girls and boys was the same on the day of the field trip, we can set up an equation:\n\nNumber of girls = Number of boys\n\nLet's say x is the number of girls who did not join the trip. Then, the number of girls who actually joined the trip is:\n\n10 - x\n\nSince the number of girls and boys is the same, we can set up the equation:\n\n10 - x = 8\n\nSubtract 8 from both sides:\n\n10 - x - 8 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2 - x = 0\n\nAdd x to both sides:\n\n2 = x\n\nSo, x = 2.

To find the number of marbles he loses, we can multiply the total number of marbles he starts with by 0.6.\n\nLet's say Archie starts with x marbles. Then, he loses 0.6x marbles into the street.\n\nAfter losing marbles into the street, Archie has 40% of his original marbles left (100% - 60% = 40%). So, he has 0.4x marbles left.\n\nFrom these 0.4x marbles, Archie loses half down the sewer. To find the number of marbles he loses down the sewer, we can multiply the remaining marbles by 0.5:\n\n0.4x \u00d7 0.5 = 0.2x\n\nArchie has 20 marbles left after losing half of the remaining marbles down the sewer. This means that 0.2x = 20.\n\nTo find the original number of marbles Archie had, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.2:\n\nx = 20 / 0.2\nx = 100\n\nSo, Archie started with 100 marbles.\n\nFinal Answer: 100",

        "Let's calculate the total points scored by James in each game:\n\nGame 1: 30 points\nGame 2: 28 points\nGame 3: 32 points\nGame 4: 34 points\nGame 5: 26 points\n\nTotal points: 30 + 28 + 32 + 34 + 26 = 150 points\n\nSince there are 5 games, we need to calculate the average points per game:\n\nAverage points per game = Total points / Number of games\n= 150 points / 5 games\n= 30 points per game\n\nSince James averaged 30 points or more per game, he gets paid $10,000.\n\nFinal Answer: $10,000",
        "Let's break it down step by step!\n\nSalvadore earned $1956.\n\nSanto earned half of what Salvadore earned, so we need to find half of $1956.\n\nHalf of $1956 is $978.\n\nSo, Santo earned $978.\n\nTo find out how much money the two men earned together, we add the amounts they earned:\n\n$1956 (Salvadore) + $978 (Santo) = $2934\n\nFinal Answer: 2934"
