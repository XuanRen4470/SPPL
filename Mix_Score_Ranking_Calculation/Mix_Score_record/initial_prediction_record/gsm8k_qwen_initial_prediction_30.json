        "To determine the total number of clips Natalia sold in April and May, we start by identifying the number of clips sold in each month.\n\nFirst, we know that Natalia sold 48 clips in April. \n\nNext, we need to find out how many clips she sold in May. According to the problem, she sold half as many clips in May as she did in April. Therefore, we calculate the number of clips sold in May as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Clips sold in May} = \\frac{48}{2} = 24\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of clips sold in April and May to find the total number of clips sold over the two months:\n\\[\n\\text{Total clips sold} = 48 + 24 = 72\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of clips Natalia sold in April and May is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{72}\n\\]",

        "To determine how many tennis balls Ralph did not hit, we need to calculate the number of balls he hit and then subtract that from the total number of balls.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of balls Ralph hit out of the first 100 balls. He hit \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) of them:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} \\times 100 = 40\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of balls he hit out of the next 75 balls. He hit \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of them:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 75 = 25\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of balls he hit from both sets to find the total number of balls he hit:\n\\[\n40 + 25 = 65\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of balls he hit from the total number of balls to find the number of balls he did not hit:\n\\[\n175 - 65 = 110\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of tennis balls Ralph did not hit is \\(\\boxed{110}\\).",
        "To determine how much salt Jack will get, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the volume of seawater from liters to milliliters:**\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ liters} = 2000 \\text{ milliliters}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the amount of salt in the seawater:**\n   Since the seawater is 20% salt, we need to find 20% of 2000 milliliters.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount of salt} = 2000 \\text{ milliliters} \\times 0.20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Perform the multiplication:**\n   \\[\n   2000 \\times 0.20 = 400 \\text{ milliliters}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, when all the water evaporates, Jack will get \\(\\boxed{400}\\) milliliters of salt.",
        "First, let's determine how many files Brennan kept after deleting 70% of the initial 800 files.\n\n1. Calculate 70% of 800 files:\n\\[ 0.70 \\times 800 = 560 \\]\nSo, Brennan deleted 560 files, and he kept:\n\\[ 800 - 560 = 240 \\]\n\nNext, Brennan downloaded 400 more files, but he found that 3/5 of them were irrelevant.\n\n2. Calculate 3/5 of 400 files:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{5} \\times 400 = 240 \\]\nSo, Brennan deleted 240 files, and he kept:\n\\[ 400 - 240 = 160 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of valuable files he was left with after the second round of deletions.\n\n3. Add the valuable files from both rounds:\n\\[ 240 + 160 = 400 \\]\n\nFinal Answer: 400",
        "To determine how many gnomes the fifth house has, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of gnomes in the first four houses.\n2. Subtract this number from the total number of gnomes on the street to find the number of gnomes in the fifth house.\n\nFirst, we know that each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes. Therefore, the total number of gnomes in these four houses is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\]\n\nNext, we know the total number of gnomes on the street is 20. So, the number of gnomes in the fifth house is:\n\\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \\]\n\nThus, the fifth house has \\(\\boxed{8}\\) gnomes.",
        "Let's denote Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income as \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, she used to spend 40% of her monthly income on rent and utilities. Therefore, the amount spent on rent and utilities was:\n\\[\n0.4x\n\\]\n\nAfter her salary was increased by $600, her new monthly income is:\n\\[\nx + 600\n\\]\n\nNow, the rent and utilities amount to 25% of her new monthly income. Therefore, the amount spent on rent and utilities is also:\n\\[\n0.25(x + 600)\n\\]\n\nSince the amount spent on rent and utilities remains the same, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n0.4x = 0.25(x + 600)\n\\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\n0.4x = 0.25x + 150\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( 0.25x \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n0.4x - 0.25x = 150\n\\]\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\\[\n0.15x = 150\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 0.15:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{150}{0.15}\n\\]\n\nCalculate the value:\n\\[\nx = 1000\n\\]\n\nThus, Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1000}\n\\]"
