        "To determine the total number of clips Natalia sold in April and May, we start by identifying the number of clips sold in each month.\n\nFirst, we know that Natalia sold 48 clips in April. \n\nNext, we need to find out how many clips she sold in May. According to the problem, she sold half as many clips in May as she did in April. Therefore, we calculate the number of clips sold in May as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Clips sold in May} = \\frac{48}{2} = 24\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of clips sold in April and May to find the total number of clips sold over the two months:\n\\[\n\\text{Total clips sold} = 48 + 24 = 72\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of clips Natalia sold in April and May is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{72}\n\\]",

Since his baseball season is 4 months long, he has:\n\\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \\text{ months} \\]\nto save up.\n\nGerald charges $10 for each chore he does. To find out how many chores he needs to do in total to save $400, we divide the total amount needed by the amount he earns per chore:\n\\[ \\frac{400}{10} = 40 \\text{ chores} \\]\n\nSince he has 8 months to do these chores, we need to find out how many chores he needs to do on average each month.

This is done by dividing 50 by 6:\n\n\\[ \\frac{50}{6} \\approx 8.33 \\]\n\nSince we can only give away whole cones, we take the integer part of the division, which is 8. Therefore, Dan gave away 8 free cones.\n\nFinal Answer: 8",

Since one story is 10 feet and he needs to lower the rope down 6 stories, the total length required is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 10 = 60 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the effective length of each piece of rope after accounting for the 25% loss when lashing them together. Each piece of rope is 20 feet long, and losing 25% means that only 75% of the length is usable. Therefore, the effective length of each piece is:\n\\[ 20 \\times (1 - 0.25) = 20 \\times 0.75 = 15 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many 15-foot pieces of rope are required to get at least 60 feet of usable rope. We do this by dividing the total length needed by the effective length of each piece:\n\\[ \\frac{60}{15} = 4 \\]\n\nSince Tom cannot buy a fraction of a piece of rope, he will need to buy 4 pieces of rope.

To find the daily consumption in watt-hours (Wh), we multiply the power usage by the number of hours used:\n\n\\[ 125 \\text{ watts} \\times 4 \\text{ hours} = 500 \\text{ watt-hours} \\]\n\nNext, we convert the daily consumption from watt-hours to kilowatt-hours (kWh) because the cost is given per kilowatt-hour. There are 1000 watts in a kilowatt, so we divide the watt-hours by 1000:\n\n\\[ 500 \\text{ watt-hours} \\div 1000 = 0.5 \\text{ kWh} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the daily cost of running the TV. The cost is 14 cents per kWh, so we multiply the daily consumption in kWh by the cost per kWh:\n\n\\[ 0.5 \\text{ kWh} \\times 14 \\text{ cents/kWh} = 7 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nTo find the weekly cost, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in a week (7 days):\n\n\\[ 7 \\text{ cents/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 49 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost to run the TV for a week is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{49} \\]",

Therefore, her reading rate is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Lulu's rate} = \\frac{27 \\text{ pages}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{9 \\text{ pages}}{20 \\text{ minutes}}\n   \\]\n   In 240 minutes, Lulu reads:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pages read by Lulu} = 240 \\text{ minutes} \\times \\frac{9 \\text{ pages}}{20 \\text{ minutes}} = 240 \\times \\frac{9}{20} = 12 \\times 9 = 108 \\text{ pages}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cherry's Reading Rate:**\n   Cherry reads 25 pages in 60 minutes. Therefore, her reading rate is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cherry's rate} = \\frac{25 \\text{ pages}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ pages}}{12 \\text{ minutes}}\n   \\]\n   In 240 minutes, Cherry reads:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pages read by Cherry} = 240 \\text{ minutes} \\times \\frac{5 \\text{ pages}}{12 \\text{ minutes}} = 240 \\times \\frac{5}{12} = 20 \\times 5 = 100 \\text{ pages}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Pages Read:**\n   Adding the pages read by Rene, Lulu, and Cherry:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total pages} = 120 \\text{ pages} + 108 \\text{ pages} + 100 \\text{ pages} = 328 \\text{ pages}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pages they have finished reading in 240 minutes is \\(\\boxed{328}\\).",
        "To determine how many ounces of oil Sonja used in her last batch of peanut butter, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the ratio of oil to peanuts**: Sonja uses a ratio of 2 ounces of oil to 8 ounces of peanuts.

When Kevin puts his laptop and work papers in his briefcase, the total weight of the briefcase is:\n\n\\[ B + L + P \\]\n\nThe problem states that this total weight is twice the weight of Karen\u2019s tote.

        "First, we calculate the total cost Jonah incurred for buying the pineapples. He bought 6 pineapples at $3 each:\n\\[ 6 \\times 3 = 18 \\]\nSo, the total cost is $18.\n\nNext, we determine the total number of pineapple rings Jonah has. Since each pineapple can be cut into 12 rings, the total number of rings from 6 pineapples is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 12 = 72 \\]\nSo, Jonah has 72 pineapple rings.\n\nJonah sells the rings in sets of 4 for $5 each. To find out how many sets of 4 rings he can sell, we divide the total number of rings by 4:\n\\[ 72 \\div 4 = 18 \\]\nSo, he can sell 18 sets of 4 rings. The total revenue from selling these rings is:\n\\[ 18 \\times 5 = 90 \\]\nSo, the total revenue is $90.\n\nTo find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:\n\\[ 90 - 18 = 72 \\]\nSo, the profit Jonah made is:\n\\[ \\boxed{72} \\]",
        "To determine how much more money Mrs. Smith will need after the discount, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**\n   Mrs. Smith needs two-fifths more money than she has. She has $500, so the additional amount needed is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{5} \\times 500 = 200\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total cost before the discount is:\n   \\[\n   500 + 200 = 700\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the discount amount:**\n   The shop owner gives a 15% discount on the total cost of $700. The discount amount is:\n   \\[\n   0.15 \\times 700 = 105\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**\n   Subtract the discount amount from the total cost:\n   \\[\n   700 - 105 = 595\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how much more money Mrs. Smith needs:**\n   Mrs. Smith has $500, so the additional amount she needs is:\n   \\[\n   595 - 500 = 95\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final amount of money Mrs. Smith still needs is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{95}\n\\]",

Calculate the total number of matchsticks he originally had based on the fact that he used only half of his pile.\n\nFirst, we know that each matchstick house uses 10 matchsticks and Michael made 30 houses. So, the total number of matchsticks used is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ houses} \\times 10 \\text{ matchsticks/house} = 300 \\text{ matchsticks} \\]\n\nSince Michael used only half of his matchsticks, the total number of matchsticks he originally had is:\n\\[ 300 \\text{ matchsticks} \\times 2 = 600 \\text{ matchsticks} \\]\n\nTherefore, the original number of matchsticks Michael had is:\n\\[ \\boxed{600} \\]",
        "To determine how much James's favorite basketball player gets paid for the week, we need to calculate the average points scored per game and then use that to determine the payment.\n\nFirst, we sum the points scored in each game:\n\\[\n30 + 28 + 32 + 34 + 26\n\\]\n\nAdding these together:\n\\[\n30 + 28 = 58\n\\]\n\\[\n58 + 32 = 90\n\\]\n\\[\n90 + 34 = 124\n\\]\n\\[\n124 + 26 = 150\n\\]\n\nSo, the total points scored over the five games is 150.\n\nNext, we calculate the average points per game by dividing the total points by the number of games (5):\n\\[\n\\frac{150}{5} = 30\n\\]\n\nThe average points per game is 30.
