In this case, we know that the length (l) is the difference between the x-coordinates of the right and left vertices, and the width (w) is the difference between the y-coordinates of the top and bottom vertices.\n\nFirst, let's find the length (l):\nl = |x2 - x1| = |(7) - (-1)| = |8| = 8\n\nNext, let's find the width (w):\nw = |y2 - y1|\n\nWe know that the area is 72 square units, so:\n72 = 8w\nw = 9 square units\n\nNow, we can find y:\ny = y1 + w = 3 + 9 = 12\n\nFinal Answer: 12",
        "To find the radius of the sphere, we need to find the radius of the circular base at the top of the truncated cone, which is also the radius of the sphere since it is tangent to the top base.\n\nThe height of the truncated cone can be found using the formula:\n\nh = sqrt(h^2 + (r1^2 - r2^2)^2)\n\nwhere h is the height, r1 is the radius of the larger base, and r2 is the radius of the smaller base.\n\nh = sqrt(h^2 + (18^2 - 2^2)^2)\nh = sqrt(h^2 + (324)^2)\nh = sqrt(h^2 + 10921)\n\nTo find the height, we need to know that the lateral surface area of the truncated cone is equal to the surface area of the sphere. The lateral surface area of a truncated cone can be found using the formula:\n\nL = \u03c0h(r1 + r2)\n\nThe surface area of a sphere can be found using the formula:\n\nA = 4\u03c0r^2\n\nSetting L = A, we get:\n\n\u03c0h(r1 + r2) = 4\u03c0r^2\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n\u03c0h(18 + 2) = 4\u03c0r^2\n\u03c0h(20) = 4\u03c0r^2\nh = (4/\u03c0)r^2\n\nSubstituting h from the first equation:\n\nh = sqrt(h^2 + 10921)\n(4/\u03c0)r^2 = sqrt(h^2 + 10921)\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(4/\u03c0)^2r^4 = h^2 + 10921\nh^2 = (\u03c0^2/4)r^4 - 10921\n\nNow we need to find the value of r that makes h positive.

        "To find the number of points that are 100-ray partitional but not 60-ray partitional, we first need to determine the number of points that are partitional for each case.\n\nLet's start with 60-ray partitional points. A point $X$ in the interior of the unit square is 60-ray partitional if and only if it is the center of an equilateral triangle inscribed in the square. The side length of an equilateral triangle inscribed in a square is $\\sqrt{3}/2$ times the side length of the square, which is $\\sqrt{3}/2$. The area of such a triangle is $\\sqrt{3}/4$ times the area of the square, which is $\\sqrt{3}/4$.\n\nThe number of points in the interior of the square that are the centers of inscribed equilateral triangles with side length $\\sqrt{3}/2$ is equal to the number of lattice points in a square of side length $\\sqrt{3}/2$, which is $\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}/2+1}{\\sqrt{3}/2-1}\\right)^2 = 60^2$.\n\nNow let's consider 100-ray partitional points. A point $X$ in the interior of the unit square is 100-ray partitional if and only if it is the center of a regular dodecahedron inscribed in the square. The side length of a regular dodecahedron inscribed in a square is $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{2}$ times the side length of the square, which is $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{2}$. The volume of such a dodecahedron is $\\frac{3\\sqrt{5}+2}{12}$ times the volume of the unit cube, which is $\\frac{3\\sqrt{5}+2}{12}$.\n\nThe number of points in the interior of the square that are the centers of inscribed regular dodecahedra with side length $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{2}$ is equal to the number of lattice points in a cube of side length $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{2}$, which is $\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{2}+1\\right)^3 = 120^3$.\n\nHowever, not all 100-ray partitional points are 60-ray partitional. To find the number of points that are 100-ray partitional but not 60-ray partitional, we can subtract the number of 60-ray partitional points from the number of 100-ray partitional points.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of points that are both 60-ray and 100-ray partitional. A point is both 60-ray and 100-ray partitional if and only if it is the center of an inscribed regular dodecahedron that is also the center of an inscribed equilateral triangle. In other words, it is the center of a regular dodecahedron that is also an inscribed equilateral triangle.\n\nThe side length of an inscribed equilateral triangle in a regular dodecahedron is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ times the side length of the regular dodecahedron, which is $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{2}$. The area of an inscribed equilateral triangle in a regular dodecahedron is $\\sqrt{3}/4$ times the area of the regular dodecahedron, which is $\\frac{3\\sqrt{5}+2}{12}$.\n\nWe can set up the equation $\\frac{3\\sqrt{5}+2}{12} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{2}\\right)^2$ to find the number of points that satisfy this condition. Solving for the number of points, we get $\\approx 1176.7$. However, since we cannot have a fractional number of points, we round down to the nearest integer, which is 1176.\n\nTherefore, the number of points that are both 60-ray and 100-ray partitional is 1176.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: $120^3 - 60^2 + 1176 = \\boxed{2320}$",
        "To find the number of sides of a regular polygon when you know the measure of an exterior angle, you can use the formula:\n\nn = 2 * (180 degrees / angle measure)\n\nwhere n is the number of sides and angle measure is the measure of one angle in degrees.\n\nIn this case, the angle measure is 15 degrees:\n\nn = 2 * (180 degrees / 15 degrees)\n\nCalculate the fraction first:\n\nn = 2 * 12\n\nThen multiply by 12:\n\nn = 24\n\nFinal Answer: A regular polygon with an exterior angle measuring 15 degrees has 24 sides. However, this is an unusual number for a regular polygon. It's important to note that a regular polygon with a side number that is not a product of distinct Fibonacci numbers cannot exist.

        "or the corresponding letter) and explain how to get there.\n\nLet's denote the length of $BD$ as $x$. Since $AB=2$ and $CD=AD$, we have $AC=AD+DC=AD+BD=AD+x$. Since $ABCD$ is a rectangle with right angles at $B$ and $C$, we have $AB^2+BC^2=CD^2+DA^2$, or $1^2+b^2=x^2+a^2$, where $b=BD$ and $a=AD$. Solving for $b$ and $x$ in terms of $a$, we get $b=\\sqrt{a^2-1}$ and $x=a+\\sqrt{a^2-1}$.\n\nNow we want to find all positive integers $a$ such that $a<2015$, $a+\\sqrt{a^2-1}<2015$, and $a+\\sqrt{a^2-1}$ is an integer. This is a Diophantine equation.\n\nWe can solve it by using the fact that $\\sqrt{n}$ is an integer if and only if $n$ is a perfect square. So, we need to find all positive integers $a$ such that $a^2-1$ is a perfect square and $a+\\sqrt{a^2-1}<2015$.\n\nLet's find the smallest perfect square that is greater than $a^2-1$: $\\sqrt{a^2-1+1}=\\sqrt{a^2}$. Since $a$ is a positive integer, $\\sqrt{a^2}$ is also a positive integer. Therefore, $a+\\sqrt{a^2-1}<2015$ if and only if $\\sqrt{a^2}<2015$.\n\nNow we want to find all positive integers $a$ such that $\\sqrt{a^2}<2015$. This is equivalent to finding all positive integers $a$ such that $a^2<2025$. The largest such integer is $\\sqrt{2025}=15$. So, we need to find all positive integers $a$ such that $a<15$.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $p$ are those perimeters of rectangles with side lengths $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, and $6$. The sum of the lengths of the sides of a rectangle with side lengths $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, and $6$ is $1+2+3+4+5+6=21$. However, we were asked for the values of $p<2015$, so the largest possible value of $p$ is $2014$.\n\nSince the side length $2$ is given, the possible values of $p$ are those perimeters of rectangles with side lengths $1$, $3$, $4$, $5$, and $6$. The sum of the lengths of the sides of a rectangle with side lengths $1$, $3$, $4$, $5$, and $6$ is $1+3+4+5+6=15$. Therefore, the possible values of $p$ are $15$, $16$, $17$, $\\dots$, $2014$.\n\nSo, there are $2014-15+1=2000$ possible values of $p$.\n\nHowever, we made a mistake in our calculation. The largest possible value of $p$ is not $2014$, but $2013$. This is because the longest side length $a$ that satisfies the given conditions is $a=6$, and the perimeter of a rectangle with side lengths $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, and $6$ is $1+2+3+4+5+6=21$, which is greater than $2013$. Therefore, the largest possible value of $p$ is $2013$.\n\nSo, the correct answer is $\\textbf{(B) }31$. There are $2013-16+1=2000$ possible values of $p$, but since $15$ and $2013$ are also possible values, there are a total of $31$ possible values of $p$.",

The distance between a point $(x,y)$ and a line $y=mx+b$ is given by the formula $|mx+b-y|$. In this case, we have $m=0$ since the line is $y=6$, so the distance is $|6-y|$.

        "To find the volume of the cube, we first need to find the length of one edge. Let's denote the length of one edge as \"s\". Since there are 12 edges in a cube, each of length \"s\", the sum of all the edges' lengths is 12s. We are given that the sum of all the edges' lengths is 60 cm, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n12s = 60\n\nTo find the value of \"s\", we need to divide both sides of the equation by 12:\n\ns = 60 / 12\ns = 5 cm\n\nNow that we have the length of one edge, we can calculate the volume of the cube using the formula:\n\nVolume = s\u00b3\n\nPlugging in the value of \"s\", we get:\n\nVolume = (5 cm)\u00b3\nVolume = 125 cm\u00b3\n\nFinal Answer: 125 cubic centimeters",

        "Since triangle $ABC$ is obtuse and isosceles, angle $C$ is the largest interior angle. In an isosceles triangle, the two equal angles are opposite the equal sides. Therefore, angle $B$ is also equal to angle $A$, which is 20 degrees. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, we can find the measure of angle $C$ as follows:\n\nFinal Answer: $180^{\\circ} - 2\\cdot20^{\\circ} = 140^{\\circ}$",

        "Let's denote the side lengths of the original triangle as a, b, and c. After tripling the side lengths, the side lengths of the new triangle will be 3a, 3b, and 3c.\n\nThe area of a triangle can be calculated using Heron's formula:\n\nArea = \u221a(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))\n\nwhere s is the semi-perimeter, calculated as (a + b + c) / 2.\n\nFirst, let's find the semi-perimeter of the new triangle:\n\ns_new = (3a + 3b + 3c) / 2 = 3(a + b + c) / 2\n\nNow, we know that the area of the new triangle is 54 square feet. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nArea_new = 54 = \u221a(s_new(s_new-3a)(s_new-3b)(s_new-3c))\n\nTo find the area of the original triangle, we need to find the side lengths a, b, and c. Let's assume that the original triangle is a right triangle with legs a and b, and hypotenuse c = a + b. This assumption simplifies the calculations since we know that the area of a right triangle is given by:\n\nArea = (1/2) * a * b\n\nWith this assumption, we can rewrite the equation for the area of the new triangle as:\n\n54 = \u221a(3(a+b+c)(3(a+b+c)-3a)(3(a+b+c)-3b)(3(a+b+c)-3(a+b)))\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n54 = \u221a(3(a+b+c)(3a+3b+3c-3a)(3a+3b+3c-3b)(3a+3b+3c-3a))\n\n54 = \u221a(3(a+b+c)(2a+2b+2c-a)(2a+2b+2c-b)(2a+2b+2c-a))\n\n54 = \u221a(3(a+b+c)(a+b+c+a-a)(a+b+c+b-b)(a+b+c+a-a))\n\n54 = \u221a(3(a+b+c)(a+b+c)(a+b+c))\n\nSince the area of a triangle cannot be negative, we have:\n\n54 > 0\n\n3(a+b+c) > 0\n\na+b+c > 0\n\nNow, let's assume that a, b, and c are all positive numbers. We can further simplify the equation as:\n\n(54)^2 = 3(a+b+c)^3\n\n(27)^2 = (a+b+c)(a^2+b^2+c^2+ab+ac+bc)\n\nBy solving this equation, we can find the possible values of a, b, and c that satisfy the given condition. After finding these values, we can calculate the area of the original triangle using the formula:\n\nArea_original = (1/2) * a * b\n\nFinal Answer: The area of the original triangle depends on the specific values of a, b, and c that satisfy the given condition. One possible solution is: a = 3, b = 4, and c = 5. In this case, the area of the original triangle is (1/2) * 3 * 4 = 6 square feet."
