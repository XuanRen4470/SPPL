        "I'd be happy to help you analyze your plans!\n\nLet's examine your first plan:\n\n[PLAN]\nunstack the blue block from on top of the orange block\nput down the blue block\npick up the orange block\nstack the orange block on top of the blue block\n[PLAN END]\n\nThis plan seems to be correct. You're unstacking the blue block from the orange block, putting it down, picking up the orange block, and then stacking it on top of the blue block. This should achieve your goal of having the orange block on top of the blue block.\n\nNow, let's examine your second plan:\n\n[PLAN]\n\n(You didn't provide a complete plan for the second scenario)\n\nTo help you with your second plan, I'd like to ask a few questions:\n\n1. What actions do you plan to take to achieve your goal of having the orange block on top of the red block?\n2. Are there any specific blocks you plan to pick up, unstack, put down, or stack?\n3. Have you considered any possible obstacles or restrictions that might affect your plan?\n\nPlease feel free to provide more information, and I'll do my best to assist you in developing a correct and effective plan!",
        "It looks like you're trying to solve a block-stacking puzzle!

You're unstacking the yellow block from the orange block, putting it down, picking up the orange block, and then stacking it on top of the red block. Well done!\n\nNow, let's see if this plan achieves your goal. After executing this plan, the blocks will be arranged as follows:\n\n* The red block is on the table\n* The orange block is on top of the red block\n* The yellow block is on the table\n\nAnd your goal is to have the orange block on top of the red block, which is achieved! Congratulations, your plan is correct!\n\nNow, let's move on to the second plan:\n\n[PLAN]\n\nIt seems like you haven't specified the actions in this plan. Could you please complete the plan by adding the specific actions you'd like to take?\n\nI'm looking forward to helping you evaluate your plan!",
        "I can help you analyze your plan.\n\nLet's go through your plan step by step:\n\n1. unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block\n\t* This is valid since the blue block is on top of the orange block, and the blue block is clear.\n\t* You pick up the blue block, and your hand is now holding the blue block.\n2. put down the blue block\n\t* This is valid since you are holding the blue block, and you can put it down.\n\t* The blue block is now on the table, and your hand is empty.\n3. unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block\n\t* This is valid since the orange block is on top of the yellow block, and the orange block is clear.\n\t* You pick up the orange block, and your hand is now holding the orange block.\n4. put down the orange block\n\t* This is valid since you are holding the orange block, and you can put it down.\n\t* The orange block is now on the table, and your hand is empty.\n5. unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block\n\t* This is valid since the yellow block is on top of the red block, and the yellow block is clear.\n\t* You pick up the yellow block, and your hand is now holding the yellow block.\n6. stack the yellow block on top of the blue block\n\t* This is valid since you are holding the yellow block, and the blue block is clear.\n\t* You put down the yellow block on top of the blue block, and your hand is empty.\n7. pick up the red block\n\t* This is valid since the red block is on the table, and it is clear.\n\t* You pick up the red block, and your hand is now holding the red block.\n8. stack the red block on top of the orange block\n\t* This is valid since you are holding the red block, and the orange block is clear.\n\t* You put down the red block on top of the orange block, and your hand is empty.\n9. unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block\n\t* This is invalid since the yellow block is not on top of the blue block. You previously stacked it on top of the blue block.\n10. stack the yellow block on top of the red block\n\t* This is invalid since you are trying to stack the yellow block on top of the red block, but the yellow block is not clear. It is currently on top of the blue block.\n\nYour plan has an issue in step 9 and 10. You cannot unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block because it is not in that position, and you cannot stack the yellow block on top of the red block because the yellow block is not clear.\n\nTo achieve your goal, you can try a different plan. Do you want me to help you come up with an alternative plan?",
        "I'd be happy to help you with your plans!\n\nFor your first plan, let's go through it step by step:\n\n1. unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block\n\t* This is allowed because the yellow block is clear and the hand is empty.\n\t* After this action, the hand holds the yellow block.\n2. put down the yellow block\n\t* This is allowed because the hand is holding the yellow block and the yellow block is clear.\n\t* After this action, the hand becomes empty.\n3. unstack the red block from on top of the orange block\n\t* This is allowed because the red block was really on top of the orange block and the red block is clear.\n\t* After this action, the hand holds the red block.\n4. put down the red block\n\t* This is allowed because the hand is holding the red block and the red block is clear.\n\t* After this action, the hand becomes empty.\n5. unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block\n\t* This is allowed because the orange block was really on top of the blue block and the orange block is clear.\n\t* After this action, the hand holds the orange block.\n6. put down the orange block\n\t* This is allowed because the hand is holding the orange block and the orange block is clear.\n\t* After this action, the hand becomes empty.\n7. pick up the yellow block\n\t* This is allowed because the yellow block is on the table and the hand is empty.\n\t* After this action, the hand holds the yellow block.\n8. stack the yellow block on top of the blue block\n\t* This is allowed because the blue block is clear and the hand is holding the yellow block.\n\t* After this action, the blue block is no longer clear.\n9. pick up the red block\n\t* This is allowed because the red block is on the table and the hand is empty.\n\t* After this action, the hand holds the red block.\n10. stack the red block on top of the yellow block\n\t* This is allowed because the yellow block is clear and the hand is holding the red block.\n\t* After this action, the yellow block is no longer clear.\n\nThe plan seems to be correct, and it should achieve the desired goal of having the red block on top of the yellow block and the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n\nFor your second plan, I'll go through it step by step as well:\n\n(Note: Please provide the rest of the plan, and I'll be happy to help you analyze it!)",
        "I think I can help you with that!\n\nYour initial plan is to:\n\n1. Pick up the yellow block\n2. Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block\n\nLet's analyze this plan:\n\nAfter step 1, you will be holding the yellow block and the hand will not be empty.\n\nAfter step 2, you will put down the yellow block on top of the orange block, which means the hand will become empty, and the yellow block will be on top of the orange block.\n\nNow, let's look at the goal: you want the red block to be on top of the blue block and the yellow block to be on top of the orange block.\n\nThe current state is that the red block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, and the yellow block is on top of the red block. To achieve the goal, you need to move the red block to the bottom and the yellow block to the top.\n\nYour current plan doesn't address the red block's position. You need to consider how to move the red block to the bottom.\n\nHere's a suggestion:\n\n1. Pick up the blue block\n2. Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block\n3. Put down the blue block on top of the red block\n4. Pick up the yellow block\n5. Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block\n\nThis plan should help you achieve the goal. What do you think?",
