        "Natalia sold 48 clips in April. In May, she sold half as many, which is 48 / 2 = 24 clips.\n\nSo, Natalia sold a total of 48 (April) + 24 (May) = 72 clips in April and May.\n\nFinal Answer: 72 clips",
        "First, we need to convert the 50 minutes of babysitting into hours. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n\n50 minutes = 50 / 60 = 0.8333 hours\n\nNext, we can calculate how much Weng earned by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours worked:\n\nEarnings = Hourly rate * Hours worked\nFinal Answer: $12/hour * 0.8333 hours = $10.00\n\nSo, Weng earned $10.00 for babysitting for 50 minutes.",
        "Betty's parents gave her $15, and her grandparents gave her twice that amount. So, her grandparents gave her $15 * 2 = $30.\n\nBetty has received a total of $15 (from her parents) + $30 (from her grandparents) = $45.\n\nThe wallet costs $100, so Betty still needs $100 - $45 = $55 to buy the wallet.\n\nFinal Answer: $55",
        "Let's calculate the number of pages Julie reads today and tomorrow:\n\nYesterday: 12 pages\nToday: 12 pages * 2 = 24 pages\n\nTomorrow: Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages. So, let's find out how many pages are left:\n120 pages total - 12 pages yesterday - 24 pages today = 84 pages\nTomorrow, Julie wants to read half of that: 84 pages * 0.5 = 42 pages\n\nFinal Answer: Julie should read 42 pages tomorrow."
