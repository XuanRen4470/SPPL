Since each of her bags has as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags, we can write the equation:\n\nx * Apples_per_Pam_bag = 1200\n\nWe know that Apples_per_Gerald_bag = 40, and Pam's bags have 3 times as many apples as Gerald's bags. So, Apples_per_Pam_bag = 3 * Apples_per_Gerald_bag = 3 * 40 = 120.\n\nNow we can substitute Apples_per_Pam_bag with 120 in the equation:\n\nx * 120 = 1200\n\nTo find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 120:\n\nx = 1200 / 120\nx = 10\n\nFinal Answer: Pam has 10 bags of apples.",

We know that she spent 30 minutes doing laundry, 15 minutes cleaning the bathroom, and 40 minutes doing homework, which totals to 85 minutes. However, she claimed to have spent a total of two hours (120 minutes) on these tasks.\n\nTherefore, the difference between the total time claimed and the time spent on the tasks we know about is the time Miriam spent cleaning her room:\n\n120 minutes (total time) - 85 minutes (laundry, bathroom, and homework) = 35 minutes\n\nFinal Answer: Miriam spent 35 minutes cleaning her room.",

We know that the amoeba divides every two days.\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n1. One division occurs every two days.\n2. We want 16 amoebae, so we need 15 divisions (since the first division creates two amoebae).\n3. Divide the number of divisions by the number of divisions per unit time: 15 divisions / 2 divisions per 2 days = 7.5 divisions per day.\n4. Since an amoeba cannot divide half a day, we need to round up to the next whole number of days.\n\nFinal Answer: 8 days.",
        "To find out how much John will make this year with his total pay and bonus, we first need to find out what percentage of his total pay the bonus represents. Last year, John made $100,000 and got a $10,000 bonus, so the bonus was 10% of his total pay ($10,000 / $100,000 = 0.1 or 10%).\n\nSince John's total pay has doubled this year, he now makes $200,000. To find out how much his bonus will be this year, we can multiply his total pay by the same percentage (10%) that his bonus represented last year: $200,000 x 0.1 = $20,000.\n\nTherefore, John will make a total of $220,000 this year ($200,000 in total pay + $20,000 in bonus).\n\nFinal Answer: $220,000",
