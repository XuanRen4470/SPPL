        "Let's find the inverse of $f(x) = 4 - 5x$.\n\nThe inverse of a function $f(x)$ is a function $g(x)$ such that $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\nTo find the inverse, we can start by writing $y = 4 - 5x$.\n\nNext, we can swap the roles of $x$ and $y$, and solve for $y$:\n\n$x = 4 - 5y$\n\nNow, we can add 5y to both sides to get:\n\n$x + 5y = 4$\n\nNext, we can subtract 4 from both sides to get:\n\n$x + 5y - 4 = 0$\n\nFinally, we can divide both sides by -5 to get:\n\n$y = -\\frac{1}{5}x + \\frac{4}{5}$\n\nSo, the inverse of $f(x)$ is $g(x) = -\\frac{1}{5}x + \\frac{4}{5}$.\n\nNow, we can compare this expression with the options:\n\nFinal Answer: D",

        "Let's break it down step by step!\n\nSince the boxes are indistinguishable, we can consider the number of balls in each box as a variable. Let's say the number of balls in the first box is x and the number of balls in the second box is 4-x.\n\nWe know that x and 4-x are non-negative integers, and their sum is 4. This means we can write the equation:\n\nx + (4-x) = 4\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nx = 2\n\nThis means the first box has 2 balls, and the second box has 2 balls as well.\n\nNow, let's count the number of ways to put the 4 distinguishable balls into the 2 indistinguishable boxes. We can do this by considering the different arrangements of the 4 balls.\n\nFor the first box, we have 2 balls, and we can arrange them in 2! = 2 ways.\n\nFor the second box, we also have 2 balls, and we can arrange them in 2! = 2 ways.\n\nSince the boxes are indistinguishable, we can't distinguish between the arrangements of the balls in each box. Therefore, we need to divide the total number of arrangements by 2! to account for the indistinguishability of the boxes.\n\nThe total number of arrangements is 2! * 2! = 4.\n\nHowever, we need to divide this by 2! to account for the indistinguishability of the boxes. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n4 / 2! = 2\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is D.",

        "Let's break it down step by step!\n\nCarlos was born on a Saturday, November 9, 2002. We need to find out what day of the week he will be 706 days old.\n\nSince Carlos is born on a Saturday, we can count the days:\n\nSaturday, November 9, 2002 (0 days old)\nSunday, November 10, 2002 (1 day old)\nMonday, November 11, 2002 (2 days old)\n...\n706 days later...\n\nTo find the day of the week 706 days later, we can use the concept of modular arithmetic. The remainder of 706 divided by 7 (the number of days in a week) is 3. This means that 706 days later, Carlos will be 3 days older than his birth day.\n\nSince Carlos was born on a Saturday, adding 3 days would make him:\n\nSaturday + 1 day = Sunday\nSunday + 1 day = Monday\nMonday + 1 day = Tuesday\n\nSo, Carlos will be 706 days old on a Tuesday.\n\nFinal Answer:\nD",

        "Let's analyze the problem:\n\nIn a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. Therefore, angle B and angle C are equal. We know that angle B measures 110\u00b0.\n\nSince opposite angles are equal, angle C also measures 110\u00b0.\n\nNow, let's look at the sum of angles in a quadrilateral (a shape with 4 sides). The sum of interior angles of a quadrilateral is always 360\u00b0.\n\nIn parallelogram ABCD, we have:\n\nAngle A + Angle B + Angle C + Angle D = 360\u00b0\n\nSince opposite angles are equal, we can substitute Angle B with Angle C:\n\nAngle A + 110\u00b0 + 110\u00b0 + Angle D = 360\u00b0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nAngle A + Angle D = 140\u00b0\n\nNow, we know that the sum of interior angles of a parallelogram is 360\u00b0. So, we can set up an equation:\n\nAngle A + Angle D + 2 \u00d7 110\u00b0 = 360\u00b0\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nAngle A + Angle D = 40\u00b0\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\nAngle A + Angle D = 140\u00b0\nAngle A + Angle D = 40\u00b0\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate Angle D:\n\n140\u00b0 - 40\u00b0 = 100\u00b0\n\nThis means that Angle A measures 100\u00b0.\n\nNow, we can find Angle D:\n\nAngle A + Angle D = 140\u00b0\n100\u00b0 + Angle D = 140\u00b0\n\nSubtract 100\u00b0 from both sides:\n\nAngle D = 40\u00b0\n\nNow that we have Angle A and Angle D, we can find Angle C:\n\nAngle C = Angle B = 110\u00b0\n\nFinal Answer:\nA",
        "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The rate at which the purification process removes contaminants is proportional to the amount of contaminant remaining. This means that the amount of contaminant removed in each minute is a constant fraction of the total amount of contaminant remaining.\n2. In the first minute, 20% of the contaminant is removed. This means that the remaining contaminant is 80% of the original amount.\n3. Since the process removes a constant fraction of the contaminant in each minute, the amount of contaminant removed in each subsequent minute will also be 20% of the remaining contaminant.\n4. To make the water safe, 98% of the contaminant must be removed. This means that the amount of contaminant remaining after the process is complete is 2% of the original amount.\n5. Since the process removes 20% of the contaminant in each minute, we can set up an equation to represent the amount of contaminant remaining after each minute:\n\nAmount remaining after 1 minute = 0.8 x Original amount\nAmount remaining after 2 minutes = 0.8 x 0.8 x Original amount\nAmount remaining after 3 minutes = 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8 x Original amount\n...\n\n6. We can use this equation to find the number of minutes required to remove 98% of the contaminant. Let's start by finding the number of minutes required to remove 80% of the contaminant (since 20% is removed in the first minute):\n\nAmount remaining after 1 minute = 0.8 x Original amount\nAmount remaining after 2 minutes = 0.8 x 0.8 x Original amount = 0.64 x Original amount\n\nSince 20% is removed in the first minute, and 64% is removed in the second minute, the total amount removed in the first two minutes is:\n\n20% + 64% = 84%\n\nThis means that after 2 minutes, 84% of the contaminant has been removed, leaving 16% remaining.\n\n7. To remove the remaining 16% of the contaminant, we need to find the number of minutes required to remove an additional 16% of the original amount. We can use the same equation:\n\nAmount remaining after 1 minute = 0.8 x 0.16 x Original amount\nAmount remaining after 2 minutes = 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.16 x Original amount = 0.1024 x Original amount\n\nSince 2% is removed in the first minute, and 10.24% is removed in the second minute, the total amount removed in the first two minutes is:\n\n2% + 10.24% = 12.24%\n\nThis means that after 2 minutes, 12.24% of the contaminant has been removed, leaving 7.76% remaining.\n\n8. To remove the remaining 7.76% of the contaminant, we need to find the number of minutes required to remove an additional 7.76% of the original amount. We can use the same equation:\n\nAmount remaining after 1 minute = 0.8 x 0.0776 x Original amount\nAmount remaining after 2 minutes = 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.0776 x Original amount = 0.04904 x Original amount\n\nSince 2% is removed in the first minute, and 4.904% is removed in the second minute, the total amount removed in the first two minutes is:\n\n2% + 4.904% = 6.904%\n\nThis means that after 2 minutes, 6.904% of the contaminant has been removed, leaving 1.096% remaining.\n\n9. To remove the remaining 1.096% of the contaminant, we need to find the number of minutes required to remove an additional 1.096% of the original amount. We can use the same equation:\n\nAmount remaining after 1 minute = 0.8 x 0.01096 x Original amount\nAmount remaining after 2 minutes = 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.01096 x Original amount = 0.008768 x Original amount\n\nSince 2% is removed in the first minute, and 0.8768% is removed in the second minute, the total amount removed in the first two minutes is:\n\n2% + 0.8768% = 2.8768%\n\nThis means that after 2 minutes, 2.8768% of the contaminant has been removed, leaving 0.1232% remaining.\n\n10. Since 98% of the contaminant must be removed to make the water safe, and 2.8768% has been removed so far, we need to remove an additional 95.1232% of the contaminant. This can be achieved",
        "To find the domain of the function, we need to find the values of x for which the function is defined. \n\nThe function is defined as long as the expression under the square root is non-negative. This means that we need to solve the inequality x^2 - 3x - 4 >= 0. \n\nFactoring the quadratic expression, we get (x + 1)(x - 4) >= 0. This is true when either (x + 1) >= 0 and (x - 4) >= 0, or (x + 1) <= 0 and (x - 4) <= 0. \n\nThe first case is true when x >= 4, and the second case is true when x <= -1.

To find the relative maximum value, we need to find the critical points of the function and then evaluate the function at those points.\n\nThe critical points of the function are found by taking the derivative and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndy/dx = (1/x) - (ln x)/x = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n1/x - ln x = 0\n\nThis equation is difficult to solve analytically, but we can use numerical methods to find the critical points.\n\nUsing numerical methods, we find that the critical point is approximately x = e.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the function at this critical point to find the relative maximum value:\n\ny = (ln e)/e = 1/e\n\nSo, the relative maximum value of the function is 1/e.\n\nFinal Answer:\nD: 1/e"
