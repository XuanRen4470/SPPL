We are given that this product is \\( n^6 \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ n^{d/2} = n^6. \\]\nThis implies:\n\\[ \\frac{d}{2} = 6 \\implies d = 12. \\]\nSo, \\( n \\) must have exactly 12 divisors.\n\nNext, we need to determine the form of \\( n \\) that has exactly 12 divisors. The number of divisors of \\( n \\) is determined by its prime factorization. If \\( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k} \\), then the number of divisors \\( d \\) is given by:\n\\[ d = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1). \\]\nWe need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1) = 12 \\). The possible factorizations of 12 are:\n1. \\( 12 = 12 \\) (i.e., \\( n = p_1^{11} \\))\n2. \\( 12 = 6 \\times 2 \\) (i.e., \\( n = p_1^5 p_2^1 \\))\n3. \\( 12 = 4 \\times 3 \\) (i.e., \\( n = p_1^3 p_2^2 \\))\n4. \\( 12 = 3 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\) (i.e., \\( n = p_1^2 p_2^1 p_3^1 \\))\n\nWe will now check each case to find the smallest \\( n \\):\n1. For \\( n = p_1^{11} \\), the smallest \\( n \\) is \\( 2^{11} = 2048 \\).\n2. For \\( n = p_1^5 p_2^1 \\), the smallest \\( n \\) is \\( 2^5 \\times 3 = 32 \\times 3 = 96 \\).\n3. For \\( n = p_1^3 p_2^2 \\), the smallest \\( n \\) is \\( 2^3 \\times 3^2 = 8 \\times 9 = 72 \\).\n4. For \\( n = p_1^2 p_2^1 p_3^1 \\), the smallest \\( n \\) is \\( 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 4 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 60 \\).\n\nAmong these, the smallest \\( n \\) is 60.

Conversely, the right sum \\( R \\) will be the largest because the function values at the right endpoints are the largest.\n\n2. **Concave Up Function**: A function that is concave up means that the graph of the function lies above the line segment connecting any two points on the graph. This property affects the trapezoid sum \\( T \\) and the midpoint sum \\( M \\).\n\n   - **Trapezoid Sum \\( T \\)**: This sum averages the left and right endpoints of each subinterval, which generally lies between the left and right sums.

For a concave up function, the midpoint sum \\( M \\) will be larger than the left sum \\( L \\) but smaller than the trapezoid sum \\( T \\) because the midpoint values tend to be closer to the average of the left and right values but still slightly less than the trapezoid values.\n\nPutting it all together, we have the following order:\n\n\\[ L \\leq M \\leq T \\leq R \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Final Answer: D**",

        "To find the relative maximum value of the function \\( y = \\frac{\\ln x}{x} \\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the derivative of the function** to locate the critical points.\n2. **Set the derivative equal to zero** to find the critical points.\n3. **Determine the nature of these critical points** (whether they are maxima, minima, or neither) using the second derivative test or by analyzing the sign of the first derivative around the critical points.\n\n### Step 1: Find the Derivative\nThe function is \\( y = \\frac{\\ln x}{x} \\). We use the quotient rule to find the derivative:\n\\[ y' = \\frac{x \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} - \\ln x \\cdot 1}{x^2} = \\frac{1 - \\ln x}{x^2} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Set the Derivative Equal to Zero\nTo find the critical points, we set the derivative equal to zero:\n\\[ \\frac{1 - \\ln x}{x^2} = 0 \\]\nThis implies:\n\\[ 1 - \\ln x = 0 \\]\n\\[ \\ln x = 1 \\]\n\\[ x = e \\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Nature of the Critical Point\nTo determine whether \\( x = e \\) is a maximum, we can use the second derivative test. First, find the second derivative:\n\\[ y'' = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{1 - \\ln x}{x^2} \\right) \\]\nUsing the quotient rule again:\n\\[ y'' = \\frac{x^2 \\cdot \\left( -\\frac{1}{x} \\right) - (1 - \\ln x) \\cdot 2x}{x^4} = \\frac{-x - 2x(1 - \\ln x)}{x^4} = \\frac{-x - 2x + 2x \\ln x}{x^4} = \\frac{-3x + 2x \\ln x}{x^4} = \\frac{-3 + 2 \\ln x}{x^3} \\]\n\nEvaluate the second derivative at \\( x = e \\):\n\\[ y''(e) = \\frac{-3 + 2 \\ln e}{e^3} = \\frac{-3 + 2 \\cdot 1}{e^3} = \\frac{-1}{e^3} \\]\nSince \\( y''(e) < 0 \\), the function has a relative maximum at \\( x = e \\).\n\n### Step 4: Find the Maximum Value\nSubstitute \\( x = e \\) back into the original function to find the maximum value:\n\\[ y(e) = \\frac{\\ln e}{e} = \\frac{1}{e} \\]\n\nTherefore, the relative maximum value of the function \\( y = \\frac{\\ln x}{x} \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{e} \\).\n\nFinal Answer: D"
