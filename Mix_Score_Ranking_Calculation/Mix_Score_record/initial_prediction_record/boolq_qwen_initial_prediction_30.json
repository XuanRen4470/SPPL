        "Inference: The context states that Persian is spoken in Iran and Afghanistan. It also mentions that in Afghanistan, the language is officially known as Dari since 1958. This implies that while the language is the same in both countries, it has a different official name in Afghanistan.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "Inference: Good Samaritan laws provide legal protection to individuals who voluntarily assist someone in distress, such as an accident victim, by offering reasonable aid. This protection is intended to encourage people to help without the fear of being sued for unintentional harm caused during the rescue attempt.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "Based on the given context, Windows Movie Maker is described as \"a part of Windows Essentials software suite.\" This directly indicates that Windows Movie Maker was indeed part of Windows Essentials.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "Let's analyze the given context:\n\n1. Powdered sugar is described as \"also called confectioners' sugar, icing sugar, and icing cake.\"\n2. It is produced by milling granulated sugar into a fine powder.\n3. It often includes an anti-caking agent.\n4. It can be made in a factory or at home using a coffee grinder or mortar and pestle.\n\nGiven these points, it is clear that \"confectioners' sugar\" is another name for powdered sugar. The context directly equates the two terms.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "Inference: While both The Elder Scrolls Online and Skyrim are part of the same series and share some thematic elements, they are distinct games with different gameplay mechanics, settings, and storylines. The Elder Scrolls Online is an MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) that spans the entire Tamriel continent, allowing players to explore, quest, and engage in combat with other players. Skyrim, on the other hand, is a single-player RPG that focuses on a more linear narrative and character development, set in the province of Skyrim specifically.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "Inference: The context states that Epsom railway station is not in the London Oyster card zone. This implies that passengers cannot use an Oyster card at Epsom station.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "To infer whether there will be a season 4 of \"Da Vinci's Demons,\" we need to consider the information provided:\n\n1. The series had a premiere on Starz in 2013.\n2. It had a second season in 2014.\n3. A third season premiered in 2015.\n4. On July 23, 2015, Starz announced that the third season would be the show's last.\n5. The creator, Goyer, left it open for a potential miniseries return.\n\nGiven that the third season was explicitly stated to be the last, and there is no official announcement of a fourth season, it is highly unlikely that a fourth season will be produced. The possibility of a miniseries return, however, is still open but not confirmed.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "Inference: The federal courts are composed of multiple levels, including the Supreme Court of the United States, which is described as the court of last resort. It operates under discretionary review, meaning it does not automatically hear every case. The Supreme Court can choose which cases to hear and does not have a basic right of appeal extending automatically to it in all cases.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "To infer, let's break down the information provided:\n1. The movie Saving Private Ryan is a 1998 war film.\n2. In the film, General George Marshall reads a letter called the Bixby letter to his officers.\n3. The purpose of the letter in the film is to illustrate the sentiment behind sending Private James Francis Ryan home.\n\nThe Bixby letter is a historical document, and it is known that it was written by Abraham Lincoln in 1861. It was written to the parents of five sons who died in the American Civil War. In the movie, this letter is used as a narrative device to emphasize the importance of saving Private Ryan, but it is not claimed that Abraham Lincoln wrote the letter for the film.\n\nGiven this information, we can infer that the letter in the movie is a reference to the historical Bixby letter, but it was not written by Abraham Lincoln for the movie.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "Let's break down the information provided:\n\n1. Batman Forever was released in June 1995.\n2. Warner Bros. commissioned a sequel immediately after the success of Batman Forever.\n3. Joel Schumacher and Akiva Goldsman were hired to direct and write the sequel.\n4. The target release date for the sequel was June 1997, which is a break from the usual 3-year gap between films.\n\nGiven these points, it is clear that Batman & Robin is indeed a sequel to Batman Forever, as it was commissioned immediately following the success of the first film and has a direct connection to it.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "Inference: Based on the given context, badgers and wolverines are both part of the family Mustelidae, which means they are related. However, they belong to different genera and subfamilies. Specifically, badgers are grouped into three subfamilies (Melinae, Mellivorinae, and Taxideinae), while wolverines are not mentioned in the context but are also part of the Mustelidae family. Therefore, while they are related, they are not the same.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "Based on the context provided, Warner Bros. canceled any plans for a sequel to Green Lantern after the film's negative reception and poor box office performance. Instead, they opted to reboot the character in the DC Extended Universe with the film Green Lantern Corps, which was set for release in 2020.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "Based on the context provided, it seems that the United States has reservations about the International Criminal Court (ICC) and is not prepared to submit the treaty to the Senate for ratification until their concerns are addressed. This suggests that the United States currently does not consider itself subject to the ICC's jurisdiction.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "Inference: Calcium carbide (CaC\u2082) is known to be a key raw material in the industrial production of acetylene. When calcium carbide reacts with water, it produces acetylene gas as one of the products.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "Based on the context provided, it states that \"a third film is currently in development and set to be released in 2019.\" This information indicates that there is indeed a Now You See Me 3 coming out.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "Inference: The given context states that converted shoot-out penalties are not considered as goals scored by a player for the purposes of their individual records or for \"golden boot\" competitions. The \"golden boot\" competition typically awards the top goal scorer in a tournament. Since shoot-out goals are not counted for individual records or the golden boot, it can be inferred that they do not count towards the golden boot.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "To infer whether there will be a new season of Cutthroat Kitchen, let's consider the following points:\n\n1. The show ended on its fifteenth season in July 2017.\n2. There have been no announcements or indications of a revival from the Food Network or Alton Brown.\n3. Other similar cooking shows on the Food Network continue to air new seasons.\n4. The show's format and concept are still relevant and popular among audiences.\n\nGiven these points, it seems unlikely that there will be a new season of Cutthroat Kitchen, as there has been no recent activity or announcements regarding its revival.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "Inference: Based on the given context, Jack Sikma was inducted into the Small College Basketball Hall of Fame as part of their second class on June 27, 2017, alongside several other notable basketball figures.\n\nFinal Answer: True",

        "Based on the context provided, the film \"The Boy in the Plastic Bubble\" is inspired by the lives of David Vetter and Ted DeVita, who both had severe immune deficiencies. This indicates that the story is based on true events, even though it may have been dramatized for the film.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "The given context describes the distinction between necessary conclusions derived from first premises (prior to sense observation) and conclusions based on sense observation. It does not explicitly state that science begins with the premise that knowledge should first be acquired through observation. In fact, the context suggests that observation comes after necessary conclusions, not before.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"science begins with the premise that knowledge should first be acquired through observation\" is not supported by the given context.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "Based on the given context, it states that Timothy Donell Brown was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "Inference: Based on the given context, drinking alcohol in public in Denmark is generally legal as long as it does not disturb public law and order. Several cafes also serve alcohol outdoors in designated areas.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
        "Inference: The statement clearly mentions that Jersey notes are not legal tender in the United Kingdom, but they are legal currency, which means they can be used and held but may not be accepted as payment by creditors or traders unless they agree to accept them.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "Inference: The context provided mentions that the Milwaukee Bucks have won one league title in 1971. However, a league title and a championship are not always the same thing. In the context of the NBA, a championship is typically referred to as an NBA title, which is awarded at the end of each NBA season after a playoff series. The context does not explicitly state that the league title in 1971 is equivalent to an NBA championship. Therefore, based on the information given, it is not clear if the Bucks have ever won an NBA championship.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "Based on the given context, penalty shoot-outs were introduced as a tie-breaker in the 1978 World Cup and have been used in the Finals tournament since then. However, the frequency and occurrence of these shoot-outs vary. Not all World Cup finals have gone to penalties, as some matches have been decided without the need for a penalty shoot-out.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "Inference: The Kingdom manga series is a fictionalized account of the Warring States period in China. It follows the experiences of a war orphan named Xin and his comrades as they strive to unify China. Since it is described as a fictionalized account, it is not based on a true story but rather a creative interpretation of historical events.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "Let's break down the information:\n\n1. As of 2014, the contracting parties to the EEA include 3 of the 4 EFTA member states and 27 of the 28 EU member states.\n2. Croatia is the 28th EU member state.\n3. Croatia finished negotiating its accession to the EEA in November 2013.\n4. Since April 12, 2014, Croatia has been provisionally applying the EEA agreement, pending ratification by all EEA member states.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that Croatia is in the process of becoming a part of the EEA but has not yet fully ratified the agreement. Therefore, it is not yet a full member but is provisionally applying the agreement.\n\nFinal Answer: False",
        "Based on the context provided, posthumous marriage is legal in France. This means that a marriage can be legally contracted with a deceased person under certain circumstances. The context also mentions that France has received hundreds of requests each year for posthumous marriages, and many of these requests have been accepted.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
