The second field goal was scored by Hanson's replacement, David Akers, in the second quarter from a distance of 28 yards. The third field goal was scored by Matt Prater in the third quarter from a distance of 1 yard.

        "The passage states that Jason Hanson scored a field goal for the Lions in the first quarter, but it does not explicitly mention the number of yards for the field goal. However, based on the context of the passage, it is reasonable to infer that the field goal was a successful attempt, and the number of yards is typically indicated in the description of a field goal. Therefore, it is likely that the passage inadvertently left out the number of yards for Hanson's field goal.\n\nFinal Answer: The passage does not provide the number of yards for Jason Hanson's field goal in the first quarter.",

Without further information, we cannot determine the exact length of Brady's fourth TD pass, so the answer is given as a minimum."
