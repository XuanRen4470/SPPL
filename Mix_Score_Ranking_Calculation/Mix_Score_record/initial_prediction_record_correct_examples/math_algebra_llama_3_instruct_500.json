        "Let $g$ be the number of girls at the school, and $b$ be the number of boys at the school.  We know that $g+b=1200$, and that $\\frac{2}{3}g+\\frac{1}{2}b=730$.  We can solve this system of equations by first subtracting $\\frac{1}{2}b$ from both sides of the second equation, to get $\\frac{2}{3}g+\\frac{1}{2}b-\\frac{1}{2}b=\\frac{2}{3}g=730-\\frac{1}{2}b$.  Then, multiplying both sides of the equation by $\\frac{3}{2}$, we get $2g=730-\\frac{3}{2}b$.  Now, substituting $1200-b$ for $g$ in the equation $2g=730-\\frac{3}{2}b$, we get $2(1200-b)=730-\\frac{3}{2}b$.  Simplifying the equation, we get $2400-2b=730-\\frac{3}{2}b$.  Adding $\\frac{3}{2}b$ to both sides of the equation, we get $2400-2b+\\frac{3}{2}b=730$.  Then, simplifying, we get $2400-2b+\\frac{3}{2}b=730$, or $2400-\\frac{1}{2}b=730$.  Finally, adding $\\frac{1}{2}b$ to both sides of the equation, we get $2400=730+\\frac{1}{2}b$.  Subtracting 730 from both sides of the equation, we get $1670=\\frac{1}{2}b$.  Multiplying both sides of the equation by 2, we get $3340=b$.  Now, substituting $3340$ for $b$ in the equation $g+b=1200$, we get $g+3340=1200$.  Subtracting 3340 from both sides of the equation, we get $g=1200-3340=-2140$.  Since we cannot have a negative number of girls, we know that this is incorrect.  This means that we have made an error in our previous steps.  Let's rework the problem.\n\nLet $g$ be the number of girls at the school, and $b$ be the number of boys at the school.
