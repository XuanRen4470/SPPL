        "I can help you analyze your plan.\n\nYour initial plan is:\n\n1. Pick up the blue block\n\nThis action is valid because the blue block is clear, and your hand is empty. After picking up the blue block, your hand will be holding the blue block, and the blue block will no longer be clear.\n\nYour goal is to have the yellow block clear, the hand holding the blue block, the red block on top of the orange block, the yellow block on top of the red block, and the orange block on the table.\n\nHowever, after picking up the blue block, the yellow block is no longer clear because the blue block is now on top of it. Your plan does not seem to address this issue.\n\nAdditionally, your plan does not mention what to do with the blue block after picking it up. You are holding the blue block, but you need to put it down or stack it on top of another block to achieve your goal.\n\nIt seems that your plan needs to be revised to address the issues mentioned above. Would you like me to help you come up with an alternative plan to achieve your goal?\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up blue)\n",

        "It seems like you're trying to solve a block-stacking problem. You've provided your initial conditions, goal, and plan. Let's go through your plan step by step to see if it's valid and if it will achieve your goal.\n\nHere's your plan:\n\n1. Unstack the blue block from on top of the red block\n2. Stack the blue block on top of the orange block\n3. Pick up the yellow block\n4. Stack the yellow block on top of the red block\n5. Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block\n6. Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block\n\nLet's analyze each step:\n\nStep 1: Unstack the blue block from on top of the red block\n- This step is valid because the blue block is on top of the red block, and the blue block is clear.\n\nStep 2: Stack the blue block on top of the orange block\n- This step is valid because the blue block is clear and the orange block is clear.\n\nStep 3: Pick up the yellow block\n- This step is valid because the yellow block is clear and the hand is empty.\n\nStep 4: Stack the yellow block on top of the red block\n- This step is valid because the yellow block is clear and the red block is clear.\n\nStep 5: Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block\n- This step is valid because the blue block was really on top of the orange block, and the blue block is clear.\n\nStep 6: Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block\n- This step is valid because the blue block is clear and the yellow block is clear.\n\nNow, let's check if your plan achieves your goal. Your goal is to have the blue block on top of the yellow block and the yellow block on top of the red block. After executing your plan, the blue block will be on top of the orange block, and the yellow block will be on top of the red block. This is close, but not exactly what you wanted.\n\nIt seems like your plan is almost correct, but you're missing one more step to achieve your goal. You need to unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block and then stack it on top of the blue block on top of the orange block.\n\nHere's the corrected plan:\n\n1. Unstack the blue block from on top of the red block\n2. Stack the blue block on top of the orange block\n3. Pick up the yellow block\n4. Stack the yellow block on top of the red block\n5. Unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block\n6.

To fix this, you can modify the plan by putting the blue block on top of the yellow block after step 6, before stacking the orange block on top of the red block. This will ensure that the blue block is clear at the end.\n\nHere's the modified plan:\n\n1. unstack the red block from on top of the blue block\n2. put down the red block\n3. unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block\n4. put down the blue block\n5. pick up the red block\n6. stack the red block on top of the blue block\n7. put the blue block on top of the yellow block\n8. unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block\n9. put down the yellow block\n10. pick up the orange block\n11. stack the orange block on top of the red block\n12. pick up the yellow block\n13. stack the yellow block on top of the orange block\n\nThis modified plan should achieve the goal.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n",

        "It looks like you're trying to come up with a plan to achieve a specific goal, but you haven't actually written down your plan.

        "I see you've provided the initial conditions and your plan to achieve your goal. However, I noticed that your goal and plan don't quite match the initial conditions. You mentioned your goal is to have the orange block clear, but in the initial conditions, the orange block is already on top of the yellow block, which means it's not clear.\n\nAlso, your plan doesn't seem to be following the rules you provided. For example, in step 1, you plan to unstack the red block from on top of the orange block, but the red block is already clear, so you can't unstack it from anything.\n\nI'd be happy to help you refine your plan and achieve your goal. Could you please clarify what you're trying to achieve and what you think is the correct plan to get there?\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red orange)\n"
