        "To find the value of \\( x \\) that gives the minimum value for the quadratic function \\( f(x) = x^2 - 10x + 24 \\), we can use the vertex formula for a parabola. The vertex form of a quadratic function \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) gives the \\( x \\)-coordinate of the vertex as \\( x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\).\n\nFor the given function \\( f(x) = x^2 - 10x + 24 \\), the coefficients are:\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n- \\( b = -10 \\)\n- \\( c = 24 \\)\n\nUsing the vertex formula:\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{b}{2a} = -\\frac{-10}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( x \\) that gives the minimum value for the function is \\( x = 5 \\).\n\nTo confirm, we can complete the square for the quadratic function. Starting with:\n\\[\nf(x) = x^2 - 10x + 24\n\\]\n\nWe complete the square as follows:\n1. Take the coefficient of \\( x \\), which is \\(-10\\), divide it by 2, and square it:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{-10}{2}\\right)^2 = 25\n\\]\n\n2. Add and subtract this square inside the function:\n\\[\nf(x) = x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 + 24\n\\]\n\n3. Rewrite the expression by grouping the perfect square trinomial:\n\\[\nf(x) = (x - 5)^2 - 1\n\\]\n\nThe function \\( f(x) = (x - 5)^2 - 1 \\) is in vertex form, where the vertex is at \\( (5, -1) \\). The minimum value of \\( (x - 5)^2 \\) is 0, which occurs when \\( x = 5 \\).\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( x \\) that gives the minimum value for \\( x^2 - 10x + 24 \\) is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nFinal Answer: 5.0",
        "To determine the degree of \\( g(x) \\), we start by analyzing the given polynomial \\( h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x) \\). We know the degrees of \\( h(x) \\) and \\( f(x) \\), and we need to find the degree of \\( g(x) \\).\n\nLet's denote the degrees of the polynomials as follows:\n- \\(\\deg(f(x)) = 2\\)\n- \\(\\deg(g(x)) = d\\)\n- \\(\\deg(h(x)) = 6\\)\n\nFirst, consider the term \\( f(g(x)) \\). Since \\( f(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree 2, when we substitute \\( g(x) \\) into \\( f(x) \\), the degree of \\( f(g(x)) \\) is determined by the degree of \\( g(x) \\). Specifically, if \\( \\deg(g(x)) = d \\), then the degree of \\( f(g(x)) \\) is \\( 2d \\).\n\nNext, consider the term \\( g(x) \\). The degree of \\( g(x) \\) is simply \\( d \\).\n\nThe degree of the sum of two polynomials is the maximum of their degrees, provided that the leading coefficients do not cancel each other out. Therefore, the degree of \\( h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x) \\) is the maximum of \\( 2d \\) and \\( d \\). Since we are given that the degree of \\( h(x) \\) is 6, we have:\n\\[\n\\max(2d, d) = 6\n\\]\nThis equation tells us that \\( 2d \\) must be 6 because \\( 2d \\) is always at least as large as \\( d \\), and if \\( d \\) were 6, then \\( 2d \\) would be 12, which is too large. Therefore, we solve:\n\\[\n2d = 6 \\implies d = 3\n\\]\n\nThus, the degree of \\( g(x) \\) is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).\n\nFinal Answer: 3.0",

        "The given sequence is 1,000,000; 500,000; 250,000; and so on, where each term is obtained by dividing the previous term by 2. We need to determine the last integer in this sequence.\n\nFirst, let's express the terms of the sequence in a general form. The first term is \\(a_1 = 1,000,000\\). The second term is \\(a_2 = \\frac{1,000,000}{2} = 500,000\\). The third term is \\(a_3 = \\frac{500,000}{2} = 250,000\\), and so on. The \\(n\\)-th term of the sequence can be written as:\n\\[a_n = \\frac{1,000,000}{2^{n-1}}.\\]\n\nWe need to find the largest integer \\(n\\) such that \\(a_n\\) is an integer. This means that \\(2^{n-1}\\) must be a divisor of \\(1,000,000\\). First, we factorize \\(1,000,000\\):\n\\[1,000,000 = 10^6 = (2 \\cdot 5)^6 = 2^6 \\cdot 5^6.\\]\nThe highest power of 2 that divides \\(1,000,000\\) is \\(2^6\\). Therefore, the largest \\(n-1\\) such that \\(2^{n-1}\\) divides \\(1,000,000\\) is 6. This means the largest \\(n\\) is \\(6+1 = 7\\).\n\nSo, the 7th term of the sequence is:\n\\[a_7 = \\frac{1,000,000}{2^6} = \\frac{1,000,000}{64} = 15,625.\\]\nThe 8th term of the sequence is:\n\\[a_8 = \\frac{1,000,000}{2^7} = \\frac{1,000,000}{128} = 7,812.5,\\]\nwhich is not an integer. Therefore, the last integer in the sequence is the 7th term, which is 15,625.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\\boxed{15625}.\\]\n\nFinal Answer: 15625.0",

        "Given that Marcelle and Jaclyn each think of a monic polynomial of degree 4, let's denote Marcelle's polynomial by \\( P(z) \\) and Jaclyn's polynomial by \\( Q(z) \\). Both polynomials are monic, so they can be written as:\n\\[ P(z) = z^4 + a_3 z^3 + a_2 z^2 + a_1 z + c \\]\n\\[ Q(z) = z^4 + b_3 z^3 + b_2 z^2 + b_1 z + c \\]\nwhere \\( c \\) is the constant term and \\( a_1 \\) and \\( b_1 \\) are the coefficients of \\( z \\).\n\nThe product of their polynomials is given by:\n\\[ P(z) \\cdot Q(z) = z^8 + 3z^7 + z^6 + 3z^5 + 4z^4 + 6z^3 + 2z^2 + 4. \\]\n\nFrom the product, we can see that the constant term of the product is \\( c \\cdot c = c^2 \\). Since the constant term of the product is 4, we have:\n\\[ c^2 = 4. \\]\nThus, \\( c = 2 \\) or \\( c = -2 \\). Since the problem states that the constant term is positive, we have \\( c = 2 \\).\n\nNext, we need to verify that the coefficient of \\( z \\) in the product is consistent with the given form. The coefficient of \\( z \\) in the product is obtained by summing the products of the coefficients of \\( z \\) from each polynomial and the constant term from the other polynomial, as well as the product of the coefficients of \\( z^2 \\) from each polynomial:\n\\[ a_1 + b_1 + c^2 = a_1 + b_1 + 4. \\]\nFrom the product, the coefficient of \\( z \\) is 4, so:\n\\[ a_1 + b_1 + 4 = 4. \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ a_1 + b_1 = 0. \\]\nSince \\( a_1 \\) and \\( b_1 \\) are the coefficients of \\( z \\) in the polynomials, and they must be the same, we have \\( a_1 = -b_1 \\). This is consistent with the given form of the polynomials.\n\nTherefore, the constant term of Jaclyn's polynomial is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nFinal Answer: 2.0",
