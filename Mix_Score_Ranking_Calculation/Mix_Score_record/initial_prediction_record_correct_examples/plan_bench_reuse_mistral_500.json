        "To achieve the goal of having the blue block on top of the orange block and the yellow block on top of the red block, while keeping the initial conditions of the red block, blue block, orange block, and yellow block being clear and on the table, and the hand being empty, you can follow the plan below:\n\n[PLAN]\n1. Unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block, making sure the hand is empty before picking it up. (Since the blue block is on top of the yellow block, this action is valid.)\n2. Stack the blue block on top of the orange block, making sure the orange block is clear before stacking the blue block on it. (Since the hand is holding the blue block, this action is valid.)\n3. Pick up the yellow block, making sure the hand is empty and the yellow block is clear before picking it up. (Since the yellow block is on the table and is clear, this action is valid.)\n4. Stack the yellow block on top of the red block, making sure the red block is clear before stacking the yellow block on it. (Since the hand is holding the yellow block, this action is valid.)\n[PLAN END]\n\nAfter following this plan, the blue block will be on top of the orange block, and the yellow block will be on top of the red block, while maintaining the initial conditions that the red block, blue block, orange block, and yellow block are clear and on the table, and the hand is empty.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue yellow)\n(stack blue orange)\n",
