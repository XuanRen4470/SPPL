        "I'd be happy to help you solve the problem!\n\nSince the initial conditions are the same as in the example, I can reuse the plan from the example. However, I'll reiterate the steps to ensure they apply to this new scenario.\n\nHere's the modified plan:\n\n[PLAN]\npick up the white block\nstack the white block on top of the gold block\npick up the orange block\nstack the orange block on top of the white block\n[PLAN END]\n\nHere's the reasoning behind the plan:\n\n1. Pick up the white block: Since the white block is clear, we can pick it up.\n2. Stack the white block on top of the gold block: Since the gold block is clear, we can stack the white block on top of it.\n3. Pick up the orange block: Since the orange block is clear, we can pick it up.\n4. Stack the orange block on top of the white block: Since the white block is now on top of the gold block, we can stack the orange block on top of the white block.\n\nBy following this plan, we should be able to achieve the desired outcome: the orange block on top of the white block and the white block on top of the gold block.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up white)\n(stack white gold)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange white)\n",
