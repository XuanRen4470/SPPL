We do this by dividing \\( \\frac{27}{8} \\) by \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\):\n\\[ \\frac{27}{8} \\div \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{27}{8} \\times \\frac{4}{1} = \\frac{27 \\times 4}{8 \\times 1} = \\frac{108}{8} = \\frac{27}{2} = 13.5 \\]\n\nThis means that \\( \\frac{27}{8} \\) inches on the map represents 13.5 times the distance that \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch represents. Since \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch represents 8 miles, 13.5 times \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch will represent 13.5 times 8 miles:\n\\[ 13.5 \\times 8 = 108 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest is \\(\\boxed{108}\\) miles.\n\nFinal Answer: 108.0",

Adding these 2 years to her current age of 9 years, we get:\n\\[ 9 + 2 = 11 \\]\n\nTherefore, Lydia will be \\(\\boxed{11}\\) years old when she gets to eat an apple from her tree for the first time.\n\nFinal Answer: 11.0",
        "To determine the amount owned by James, we start by defining the amounts owned by James and Ali using variables. Let's denote the amount owned by Ali as \\( A \\). According to the problem, James owns $40 more than Ali, so the amount owned by James can be expressed as \\( A + 40 \\).\n\nWe also know that together they own $250. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\\[ A + (A + 40) = 250 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 2A + 40 = 250 \\]\n\nNext, we need to isolate \\( A \\). We do this by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 2A = 210 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 2:\n\\[ A = 105 \\]\n\nSo, Ali owns $105. Since James owns $40 more than Ali, we can find the amount owned by James by adding 40 to $105:\n\\[ A + 40 = 105 + 40 = 145 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount owned by James is \\(\\boxed{145}\\).\n\nFinal Answer: 145.0",
