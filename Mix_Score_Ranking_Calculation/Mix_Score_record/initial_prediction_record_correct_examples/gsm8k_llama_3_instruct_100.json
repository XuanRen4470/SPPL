        "Let's break this down step by step!\n\n2/3 of the 60 students receive an average of $6 per day, so the number of students getting $6 is:\n\n2/3 \u00d7 60 = 40 students\n\nThe remaining 1/3 of the students receive an average of $4 per day, so the number of students getting $4 is:\n\n1/3 \u00d7 60 = 20 students\n\nNow, let's calculate the total daily allowance for each group:\n\nFor the 40 students getting $6 per day:\n\n40 students \u00d7 $6 per day = $240 per day\n\nFor the 20 students getting $4 per day:\n\n20 students \u00d7 $4 per day = $80 per day\n\nTo find the total daily allowance for all 60 students, add the allowances for both groups:\n\n$240 per day + $80 per day = $320 per day\n\nSo, the total amount of money those 60 students get in a day is $320.\n\nFinal Answer: 320.0",
        "Jerry's daughters play 8 games each. So 8 + 8 = 16 games in total. Each game is 2 hours, so 16 * 2 = 32 hours of game time. Each game is also 4 hours of practice, so 16 * 4 = 64 hours of practice. In total, Jerry will spend 32 + 64 = 96 hours at the field. The answer is 96.\n\nFinal Answer: 96.0",
        "The bear needed to gain 1000 pounds. It gained 1/5 of 1000 from berries, which is 200 pounds. Then it gained twice that from acorns, which is 400 pounds. This is a total of 600 pounds. 1000 - 600 is 400. So it gained half of that, 200, from salmon. This means it gained 200 pounds from salmon. The remaining weight it gained from small animals is 1000 - 600 - 200 = 200 pounds. The answer is 200.\n\nFinal Answer: 200.0",
        "Let's start by finding out how much oil the 10 cans with 8 liters each are holding. Since there are 10 cans, the total oil in these cans is 10 x 8 = 80 liters.\n\nWe know that there are 290 liters of oil in total, and 80 liters are in the 10 cans. So, the remaining oil is 290 - 80 = 210 liters.\n\nThere are 24 cans in total, and 10 cans are already accounted for. So, the remaining cans are 24 - 10 = 14 cans.\n\nTo find out how much oil each of the remaining cans is holding, we can divide the remaining oil (210 liters) by the number of remaining cans (14 cans). This gives us:\n\n210 liters \u00f7 14 cans = 15 liters per can\n\nSo, each of the remaining 14 cans is holding 15 liters of oil.\n\nFinal Answer: 15.0",
        "James earns $20 an hour at his main job. 30 hours at $20 an hour is 30 * 20 = $600. At his second job, he earns 20% less, which is 80% of $20. 80% of $20 is 0.8 * 20 = $16. He works half as much at his second job, which is 30/2 = 15 hours. 15 hours at $16 an hour is 15 * 16 = $240. In total, James earns $600 + $240 = $840. The answer is $840.\n\nFinal Answer: 840.0",

We know that the first and second people lost 27 and 20 kilograms, respectively. To find the total weight lost by the first two people, we add these amounts together:\n\n27 + 20 = 47\n\nThis means that the remaining two people lost a total of:\n\n103 - 47 = 56 kilograms\n\nSince the two remaining people lost the same amount, we can divide the total weight lost by the number of people:\n\n56 \u00f7 2 = 28\n\nSo each of the last two people lost 28 kilograms.\n\nFinal Answer: 28.0",
