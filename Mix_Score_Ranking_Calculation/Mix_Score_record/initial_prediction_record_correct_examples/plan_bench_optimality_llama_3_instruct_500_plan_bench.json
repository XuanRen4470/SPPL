        "I'd be happy to help you solve the problem!\n\nSince the initial conditions are similar to the original problem, I can analyze the plan and optimize it to minimize the time taken to achieve the goal.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n[PLAN]\npick up the red block\nstack the red block on top of the blue block\npick up the yellow block\nstack the yellow block on top of the red block\n[PLAN END]\n\nLet's analyze the plan:\n\n1. Pick up the red block: 1 minute\n2. Stack the red block on top of the blue block: 1 minute\n3. Pick up the yellow block: 1 minute\n4. Stack the yellow block on top of the red block: 1 minute\n\nTotal time: 4 minutes\n\nThis plan is more efficient than the original plan, which took 8 minutes. By skipping the unnecessary steps of unstacking and putting down blocks, we can achieve the goal in half the time.\n\nTherefore, the optimized plan is:\n\n[PLAN]\npick up the red block\nstack the red block on top of the blue block\npick up the yellow block\nstack the yellow block on top of the red block\n[PLAN END]\n\nThis plan takes a total of 4 minutes to achieve the goal.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)\n"
