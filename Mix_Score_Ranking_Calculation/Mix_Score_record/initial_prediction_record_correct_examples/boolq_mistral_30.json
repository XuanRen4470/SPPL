        "In the context provided, the first kind of knowledge or argument can be referred to as \"empirical\" or \"inductive,\" as it is based on sense observation and experience. The second kind can be referred to as \"a priori\" or \"deductive,\" as it is derived from necessary premises that do not depend on sense experience.\n\nWith this in mind, the statement \"science begins with the premise that knowledge should first be acquired through observation\" can be seen as describing the empirical approach to knowledge acquisition in science. This means that scientific knowledge is built upon observations and experiences, and theories are developed to explain and make sense of the data obtained through observation.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this does not mean that all scientific knowledge is purely empirical, as there are also a priori principles and theories that play a role in scientific inquiry. For example, mathematical principles are often used to describe and explain natural phenomena, and these principles are considered to be a priori, as they are not derived from sense experience but rather from logical reasoning.\n\nTherefore, while the empirical approach is a crucial aspect of scientific inquiry, it is not the only approach, and there is also a role for a priori reasoning in science.\n\nFinal Answer: True",
