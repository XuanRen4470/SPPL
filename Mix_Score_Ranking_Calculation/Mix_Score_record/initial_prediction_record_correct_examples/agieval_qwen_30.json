        "To weaken the argument that the newly built house in Hexi Village is not protected by law, we need to find an option that challenges the premise that all small-property houses are not subject to registration and are not protected by law. Let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) **This newly built house in Hexi Village has been tacitly approved by relevant departments**\n- This option suggests that even if the house is a small property house, it has received some form of approval, which might imply some level of protection or regulation. However, it does not directly address the registration and legal protection status of small property houses.\n\n(B) **This newly built house in Hexi Village is a small property house**\n- This option confirms that the house is a small property house, which aligns with the statement that all small property houses are not protected by law. This does not weaken the argument.\n\n(C) **This newly built house in Hexi Village is built on rural collective land**\n- This option indicates that the house is on rural collective land, which is one of the conditions required by the department. However, it does not directly address the protection status of small property houses.\n\n(D) **Some of the newly built houses in Hexi Village are not small property houses**\n- This option directly challenges the statement that all small property houses are not protected by law. If some newly built houses in Hexi Village are not small property houses, it suggests that there might be protection for houses that are not small property houses, thereby weakening the argument that all small property houses are unprotected.\n\nGiven the options, the one that most effectively weakens the argument is:\n\n**(D) Some of the newly built houses in Hexi Village are not small property houses.**\n\nFinal Answer: D",
        "The answer is (D) The brain cannot process too much information in detail at the same time, and will only selectively focus on the things most relevant to the behavior.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe statement mentions that the thalamus pillow in the brain acts like an information desk operator, sorting and focusing on the most important external stimulus information for behavior and survival. This implies that the brain cannot handle and process all incoming information in detail at the same time. Instead, it selectively focuses on the most relevant information.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n(A) **Some schizophrenia are not caused by lack of attention** - This is not necessarily assumed by the statement. The statement suggests that the discovery could help with treatments for attention-related disorders, but it does not rule out other causes of schizophrenia.\n\n(B) **Visual information is only transmitted through the visual cortex to obtain a neural network to transmit** - This is not mentioned or implied in the statement. The statement does not discuss the specific pathways for visual information transmission.\n\n(C) **Researchers have developed a new technology that can directly track the communication between the nerve cortex in the visual cortex and thalamus occipital region** - The statement does not mention any specific technology or the ability to track neural communication. It only discusses the discovery of the thalamus pillow and its function.\n\n(D) **The brain cannot process too much information in detail at the same time, and will only selectively focus on the things most relevant to the behavior** - This aligns with the statement's description of the thalamus pillow as an information desk operator that focuses on the most important information. This assumption is necessary to understand the brain's selective attention mechanism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D).\n\nFinal Answer: D",
        "To determine the best argument against the statement that \"there are more and more rich people in China who are transferring their property abroad,\" we need to identify an option that directly challenges the assumption that the increase in transaction volume is solely due to wealthy individuals moving their property abroad.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Many Chinese people buy homes for their children to study in the US** - This option suggests a reason for Chinese individuals to buy US real estate but does not directly challenge the notion that rich people are transferring their property abroad.\n\nB. **Although the turnover has increased by 23%, the volume of Chinese buyers has not increased this year** - This option directly challenges the assumption by indicating that the increase in transaction volume might be due to higher spending per transaction rather than an increase in the number of buyers. If the volume of Chinese buyers has not increased, it suggests that the increase in transaction volume could be due to factors other than wealthy individuals transferring their property abroad, such as higher average spending per transaction.\n\nC. **There are groups of real estate speculators among the wealthy Chinese who have speculated in Beijing and Shanghai** - This option provides an alternative reason for the increase in Chinese property transactions in China, but it does not directly address the specific issue of Chinese buyers in the US real estate market.\n\nD. **The risk of the US real estate market has been small in recent years and has a certain function of value preservation and appreciation** - This option provides a reason why Chinese buyers might be interested in US real estate, but it does not directly challenge the notion that wealthy individuals are transferring their property abroad.\n\nThe best argument against the statement is:\n\n**B. Although the turnover has increased by 23%, the volume of Chinese buyers has not increased this year.**\n\nThis option directly challenges the assumption by suggesting that the increase in transaction volume might be due to other factors, such as higher spending per transaction, rather than an increase in the number of wealthy Chinese buyers transferring their property abroad.\n\nFinal Answer: B",

However, it does not directly address the growth rate in terms of body length over time, which is the key point in the argument.\n\n(B) **Although the lifespan of the Leeds fish and the whale shark differ greatly, they all reach adulthood around the age of 20, and their body shape is basically fixed.**\n- This option indicates that both Leeds fish and whale sharks reach adulthood at the same age and have a fixed body shape after that. If their body shapes are fixed after adulthood, it implies that their growth rates after reaching adulthood should be the same. This directly challenges the argument that Leeds fish can grow faster than whale sharks.\n\n(C) **Although the lifespan of fish is different, their growth stages basically correspond to their juvenile, adult, middle-aged, and elderly.**\n- This option is more general and does not specifically address the growth rates or the argument about the difference in growth rates between Leeds fish and whale sharks.\n\n(D) **There is no obvious change in the growth cycle of Jurassic fish and modern fish.**\n- This option suggests that the growth cycles of both Leeds fish and modern fish are similar, but it does not provide a direct comparison to refute the claim about the faster growth rate of Leeds fish.\n\nGiven the analysis, the option that best refutes the argument is:\n\n**(B) Although the lifespan of the Leeds fish and the whale shark differ greatly, they all reach adulthood around the age of 20, and their body shape is basically fixed.**\n\nThis option directly addresses the growth rate after reaching adulthood and suggests that the body shape being fixed implies similar growth rates, thereby refuting the claim that Leeds fish can grow faster than whale sharks.\n\nFinal Answer: B",
        "The answer that best supports the argument is:\n\n(A) The raw materials of these canoes cannot be transported from the distant Yunnan virgin forest, they can only be obtained locally.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe statement argues that the climate in Henan 3,000 years ago was similar to the tropical climate of Yunnan due to the discovery of canoes made from wood that is native to Yunnan. This implies that the raw materials for the canoes must have been locally sourced.\n\n- **Option (A)** directly supports this argument by stating that the raw materials for the canoes could not have been transported from Yunnan, thus indicating that the wood must have been sourced locally, which aligns with the idea that the climate in Henan was similar to Yunnan's tropical climate.\n\n- **Option (B)**, while providing information about the condition of the canoes, does not directly support the argument about the climate being similar to Yunnan's tropical climate.\n\n- **Option (C)** provides information about the location of a story, which is not relevant to the argument about the climate and the origin of the canoes.\n\n- **Option (D)** describes the construction method of the canoes, which is interesting but does not directly support the argument about the climate.\n\nTherefore, the best supporting statement is (A).\n\nFinal Answer: A",

While it provides a correlation between higher oxygen levels and larger organisms, it does not directly support the argument about insects specifically.\n\n(B) **During the Carboniferous period, the concentration of oxygen in the earth\u2019s atmosphere was as high as 35%, much higher than the current 21%. At that time, there were many giant insects on the earth, and the wingspan of the dragonfly was close to one meter.**\n- This option directly supports the argument by providing historical evidence that when oxygen levels were higher, insects were larger. It directly links higher oxygen content to larger insect sizes, which aligns with the statement's argument.\n\n(C) **Small locusts cannot survive in a low-oxygen environment, especially in an environment with an oxygen concentration below 15%. Adult locusts can survive in an environment with 2% oxygen.**\n- This option provides information about the survival limits of locusts in different oxygen concentrations but does not directly support the idea that higher oxygen levels lead to larger insect sizes.\n\n(D) **Under the environment with high oxygen content and high air pressure, the tested fruit flies lived to the fifth generation and their body size increased by 20%.**\n- This option talks about fruit flies and the effect of both high oxygen content and high air pressure. While it supports the idea that higher oxygen levels can affect insect size, it does not explicitly link it to the specific historical context provided in the argument.\n\nGiven the analysis, the best support for the argument is provided by option (B) because it directly correlates higher oxygen levels with larger insect sizes, which is the core of the argument.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**(B) During the Carboniferous period, the concentration of oxygen in the earth\u2019s atmosphere was as high as 35%, much higher than the current 21%.

Hence, if He Zhilian is not selected and we select Guo Yanran, Qiu Zhijie will not be selected.\n   - **(D) Song Wenkai**: There is no direct restriction that directly links Song Wenkai's selection to He Zhilian's non-selection.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince we are given that He Zhilian is not selected, and we need to select Guo Yanran and Fang Rufen as the girls, the conditions restrict Tang Xiaohua from being selected.\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{A}\\).\n\nFinal Answer: A",
        "To solve this problem, we need to follow the given constraints and determine which two girls must be selected if Tang Xiaohua is selected. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Constraints Recap:\n1. Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time.\n2. Peng Youwen and Song Wenkai are not selected at the same time.\n3. Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time.\n\n### Given:\n- Tang Xiaohua is selected.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Constraint 1 and 3**: Since Tang Xiaohua is selected, Guo Yanran and Qiu Zhijie cannot be selected.\n2. **Selection of Girls**: We need to select 2 out of the 3 girls (Fang Rufen, Guo Yanran, He Zhilian). Given the constraints, we can only select Fang Rufen and He Zhilian.\n\n### Selection of Boys:\n- We need to select 3 boys out of Peng Youwen, Qiu Zhijie, Ren Xiangyang, Song Wenkai, and Tang Xiaohua.\n- Since Guo Yanran and Qiu Zhijie cannot be selected, we can only choose from Peng Youwen, Ren Xiangyang, and Song Wenkai.\n- Peng Youwen and Song Wenkai cannot be selected together (Constraint 2).\n\n### Possible Combinations:\n- If Peng Youwen is selected, Song Wenkai cannot be selected. So, we can select Ren Xiangyang.\n- If Song Wenkai is selected, Peng Youwen cannot be selected. So, we can select Ren Xiangyang.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIf Tang Xiaohua is selected, the two girls that must be selected are Fang Rufen and He Zhilian.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]\n\nFinal Answer: D"
