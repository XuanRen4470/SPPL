        "To achieve the goal of having the orange block on top of the blue block and the yellow block on top of the orange block, while minimizing the time taken, we can follow a straightforward plan. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Pick up the orange block**: Since the orange block is clear and on the table, we can pick it up in 1 minute.\n2. **Stack the orange block on top of the blue block**: The blue block is also clear and on the table, so we can stack the orange block on top of it in 1 minute.\n3. **Pick up the yellow block**: The yellow block is clear and on the table, so we can pick it up in 1 minute.\n4. **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block**: The orange block is now on top of the blue block, so the yellow block can be stacked on top of the orange block in 1 minute.\n\nHere is the detailed plan with the corresponding times:\n\n1. **Pick up the orange block**: 1 minute\n2. **Stack the orange block on top of the blue block**: 1 minute\n3. **Pick up the yellow block**: 1 minute\n4. **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block**: 1 minute\n\nTotal time: \\(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\\) minutes\n\nSo, the plan to achieve the goal in the minimum time is:\n\n1.
