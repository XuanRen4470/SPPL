        "Option 1: Weld the metal together to get it to permanently attach and stay firmly in place. Welding creates a strong bond between metals that is more suitable for permanent attachment compared to nailing, which is typically used for attaching lighter materials or for temporary fixes.\n\nFinal Answer: 1",
        "Option 1: leave a space before starting the writing\n\nIndentation is the act of setting text or other elements further in from the margin. In the context of writing, it typically refers to the practice of starting a new line or paragraph with a space or tab before the text. Option 1 is correct because it describes the action of leaving a space before starting the writing, which is the definition of indenting. Option 2 is not entirely incorrect, as pressing the spacebar can create an indent, but it is not a complete description of the process.\n\nFinal Answer: 1",
        "Option 1: move it up and down and side to side quickly.\n\nExplanation: Shaking something usually involves moving it rapidly in multiple directions to mix or dislodge contents. So, option 1 is the correct answer. Option 2, stirring, is typically used when you want to mix something uniformly with a tool, like a spoon.\n\nFinal Answer: 1",
        "Option 2: Pour water, scrape off caked on dirt. Use a steel wool to clean out crevices and narrow spaces.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that steel wool should not be used on tires as it can damage the tire's surface. A tire brush or a soft-bristled brush would be a better option for cleaning tires.\n\nFinal Answer: 2",
        "Option 2: place it in your mouth to taste.\n\nAlthough the sense of smell plays a role in our perception of taste, actually tasting something involves placing it in your mouth to allow your taste buds to detect the various flavors.\n\nFinal Answer: 2",
        "Option 2: take a sponge and soak it in water. Put the sponge in a refrigerator and let it freeze. Once frozen, take it out and put it in a ziploc bag. You can now use it as an ice pack.\n\nExplanation:\nAn ice pack is used to reduce swelling and pain by applying cold pressure to an injury. The correct way to make a makeshift ice pack is by soaking a sponge or cloth in water and freezing it. Oil does not freeze and would not be effective in making an ice pack.\n\nFinal Answer: 2",
        "The correct option is: Option 1: You should coat the wooden bowl with a butcher block oil & finish per manufacturer directions.\n\nButcher block oil is a type of food-grade finish specifically designed for use on cutting boards and other wooden kitchen items. It penetrates the wood and protects it from moisture, bacteria, and stains. Using the wrong type of oil, like butcher knife oil, which is used for sharpening knives, could result in an incorrect finish or damage to the wooden bowl.\n\nFinal Answer: 1",
        "Option 2: Place your eggs in a pot and cover with cold water by 1 inch, bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then cover, remove from the heat and set aside 8 to 10 minutes.\n\nExplanation: When boiling eggs, it is important to start with cold water to prevent the eggs from cracking due to sudden temperature changes. Once the water reaches a boiling point, the eggs are placed in the pot and the heat is turned off. The eggs continue to cook in the hot water. Therefore, option 2 is the correct answer.\n\nFinal Answer: 2",
        "Both Option 1 and Option 2 are correct as they both describe the action of stabbing something with a sharp object. However, Option 1 (\"stick a sharp object through it\") is a more common and straightforward way of expressing the action. Therefore, it may be the better choice depending on the context of the sentence or conversation.\n\nFinal Answer: 1",
        "Option 1 is the correct answer. To open a Capri-Sun pouch, you should open the straw attached to the juice pack, and then stick the straw into the small hole at the front of the pouch. This will allow you to access the juice inside. Option 2, which involves cutting the top off with scissors, is not the recommended method for opening a Capri-Sun pouch.\n\nFinal Answer: 1",
        "The correct answer is Option 2: press the lock button. However, it's important to note that the lock button is also referred to as the side or power button on some iPads. Pressing and holding the lock button will turn on the iPad if it is completely off, or wake it up from sleep mode if the screen is already on.\n\nFinal Answer: 2",
        "Option 1: Put seasoning into a bowl, then place raw chicken in the bowl and coat with seasoning.\n\nExplanation: When seasoning raw chicken, it's best to use a shallow dish or bowl to ensure that all surfaces of the chicken are evenly coated with the seasoning. Using a measuring cup is not an ideal option as it may not provide enough space for the chicken to be fully coated.\n\nFinal Answer: 1",
        "Option 2: mix a little bit of sugar into the sauce to sweeten it.\n\nExplanation: Pizza sauce typically has a slightly sweet taste to balance the savory flavors. Adding sugar to the tomato sauce can help bring the taste closer to that of a pizza sauce. Paprika, while adding a nice depth of flavor, does not necessarily make the sauce taste more like pizza sauce.\n\nFinal Answer: 2",
        "Option 2: use the chalk like a pen on pavement.\n\nExplanation:\nChalk is not melted to draw on a surface. Instead, it is used by holding the stick of chalk in one hand and using the other hand to rub the chalk tip against the surface, leaving a mark. This method is similar to using a pen or pencil, but with chalk.\n\nFinal Answer: 2",
        "The correct option is: Option 1: Log in to Facebook. Click on the bell shaped button at the top right of your Facebook home window.\n\nExplanation: The bell-shaped icon at the top right corner of the Facebook homepage is used to view notifications, including new posts in your News Feed. So, to check your Facebook feed, you should log in to Facebook and click on the bell-shaped icon at the top right corner of the homepage.\n\nFinal Answer: 1",
        "Option 2: fill it with water.\n\nFlooding a room refers to filling it with a large amount of water. While Option 1, filling it with objects, may create a cluttered or cramped space, it does not result in flooding.\n\nFinal Answer: 2",
        "Option 1 is the correct answer. You can crush the cookies in a ziploc bag using a rolling pin and then mix in the butter using your hands. Option 2 is incorrect as a grater is not used for mixing ingredients.\n\nFinal Answer: 1",
        "Option 1: You need a black shirt, rubber bands, and some sun (for making a tiger stripe design using the sunbleaching method) is an option, but it's not the most common or practical way to create a black tiger shirt.\n\nOption 2: The correct answer is Option 2: You need a black shirt, rubber bands, and a bleach pen. This method involves using a bleach pen to draw the tiger stripes on the shirt, then washing it to make the design permanent. This is a more common and reliable way to create a black tiger shirt design.\n\nFinal Answer: 2",
        "Neither Option 1 nor Option 2 are correct for removing oil stains from a driveway. Beer and soda are not effective at removing oil stains. Instead, you can use a solution of dish soap and warm water, or you can use cat litter or baking soda to absorb the oil before sweeping it away.\n\nFinal Answer: 2",
        "Option 1: Wait until brewed tea bag is cool, then apply on burn.\n\nApplying a cooled tea bag on a sunburn can help soothe the skin and reduce inflammation. The tannins in tea have anti-inflammatory properties, making it an effective remedy for sunburns. However, it is important to ensure that the tea bag is cooled down before applying it to the affected area to prevent further discomfort or damage to the skin.\n\nFinal Answer: 1"
