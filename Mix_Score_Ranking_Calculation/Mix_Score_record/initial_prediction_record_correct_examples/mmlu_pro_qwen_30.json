        "The correct option for accurately measuring the diameter of Pluto is:\n\n(D): \"brightness measurements made during mutual eclipses of Pluto and Charon\"\n\nPluto and its largest moon Charon are gravitationally bound, and their orbits allow for mutual eclipses, where one passes in front of the other. By studying these eclipses, astronomers can determine the sizes of both Pluto and Charon. This method was one of the key techniques used to measure Pluto's diameter accurately.\n\nFinal Answer: D",
        "The correct option is:\n\n(D): \"Asteroids have substantial motion relative to the background stars\"\n\nAsteroids are relatively small and faint objects, so they don't stand out due to their brightness, size, or color compared to stars. However, they can be detected because they move relative to the background stars in the sky. This motion can be observed over time as the asteroid moves in its orbit around the Sun, while the stars appear mostly fixed. This relative motion is what makes asteroids stand out in sky surveys searching for them.\n\nFinal Answer: D",
        "The Andromeda Galaxy (also known as Messier 31 or M31) is approximately 2.5 million light years away from Earth. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n(B): \"2.5 million light years\"\n\nFinal Answer: B",
        "The correct option that accurately describes how the greenhouse effect works is:\n\n(F): \"Greenhouse gases transmit visible light allowing it to heat the surface but then absorb infrared light from Earth trapping the heat near the surface.\"\n\nHere's a more detailed explanation:\n\n1. **Sunlight (Visible Light)**: The Sun emits light across a spectrum, including visible light. When this light reaches the Earth, some of it is absorbed by the surface and some is transmitted through the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere do not significantly absorb visible light; instead, they allow most of it to pass through.\n\n2. **Surface Heating**: The Earth's surface absorbs the visible light and heats up. This heated surface then emits infrared (heat) radiation.\n\n3. **Absorption by Greenhouse Gases**: Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, absorb this infrared radiation. They then re-emit the infrared radiation in all directions, including back towards the Earth's surface.\n\n4. **Trapping Heat**: This process traps heat in the lower atmosphere and at the Earth's surface, leading to a warmer climate. This is the essence of the greenhouse effect.\n\nOptions (A), (B), (D), (E), (H), (I), and (J) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the absorption and emission of different types of light or incorrectly state that greenhouse gases absorb or re-emit light from the Sun rather than from the Earth's surface. Option (C) is partially correct but does not accurately describe the greenhouse effect as it incorrectly states that ozone absorbs infrared light from the Sun.\n\nFinal Answer: F",
        "To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of a charged particle in the presence of electric and magnetic fields. The key is to recognize that the proton's trajectory is not affected when it passes through the region with the electric field \\(E\\) in the +x-direction and the magnetic field \\(B\\) in the +y-direction. This implies that the forces due to the electric and magnetic fields cancel each other out.\n\n1. **Electric Force**: The electric force on a proton in an electric field \\(E\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\vec{F}_E = q \\vec{E}\n   \\]\n   where \\(q\\) is the charge of the proton. Since the proton is moving in the +z-direction, the electric force will be in the +x-direction (if \\(E\\) is in the +x-direction).\n\n2. **Magnetic Force**: The magnetic force on a proton moving in a magnetic field \\(B\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\vec{F}_B = q \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\vec{v}\\) is the velocity of the proton. If the velocity \\(\\vec{v}\\) is in the +z-direction and the magnetic field \\(\\vec{B}\\) is in the +y-direction, the magnetic force will be in the -x-direction (using the right-hand rule).\n\n3. **Condition for No Deflection**: For the proton to not be deflected, the electric force must be exactly balanced by the magnetic force. This means:\n   \\[\n   qE = qvB \\implies E = vB\n   \\]\n   where \\(v\\) is the velocity of the proton after being accelerated through the potential difference \\(V\\).\n\n4. **Velocity of the Proton**: The velocity \\(v\\) of the proton after being accelerated through a potential difference \\(V\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2qV}{m}}\n   \\]\n   where \\(m\\) is the mass of the proton.\n\n5. **Effect of Doubling the Potential Difference**: If the potential difference is doubled to \\(2V\\), the velocity of the proton will be:\n   \\[\n   v' = \\sqrt{\\frac{2q(2V)}{m}} = \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2qV}{m}} = \\sqrt{2} v\n   \\]\n   So, the new velocity is \\(\\sqrt{2} v\\).\n\n6. **New Magnetic Force**: The magnetic force with the new velocity is:\n   \\[\n   F_B' = q v' B = q (\\sqrt{2} v) B = \\sqrt{2} q v B = \\sqrt{2} F_B\n   \\]\n   Since the electric force remains the same (\\(F_E = qE = qvB\\)), the new magnetic force is \\(\\sqrt{2} F_B\\), which is greater than the electric force. Therefore, the proton will be deflected in the -x-direction.\n\nThus, the correct option is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{C}}\n\\]\n\nFinal Answer: C",
        "To determine the frequency of the next higher harmonic for an organ pipe that is closed at one end and open at the other, we need to understand the harmonic series for such a pipe. \n\nFor an organ pipe closed at one end and open at the other, the harmonics are odd multiples of the fundamental frequency. The fundamental frequency (first harmonic) is given as 131 Hz. The next higher harmonic will be the third harmonic, which is three times the fundamental frequency.\n\nLet's calculate the third harmonic:\n\n\\[ \\text{Third harmonic} = 3 \\times \\text{fundamental frequency} = 3 \\times 131 \\, \\text{Hz} = 393 \\, \\text{Hz} \\]\n\nTherefore, the frequency of the next higher harmonic for this pipe is 393 Hz.\n\nThe correct option is (H): \"393 Hz\".\n\nFinal Answer: H",
        "To determine the overall displacement from the beginning of the drive to the arrival at the gasoline station, we need to consider the initial position and the final position of the person.\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The person starts at the origin, which we can consider as 0 km.\n2. **Final Position**: The person walks an additional 2.0 km from the point where the truck ran out of gasoline. The truck ran out of gasoline after driving 8.4 km, so the final position is 8.4 km + 2.0 km = 10.4 km.\n\nThe overall displacement is the straight-line distance from the initial position to the final position. Since the person moved in a straight line along the road, the displacement is simply the difference in the final and initial positions.\n\nTherefore, the overall displacement is 10.4 km.\n\nThe correct option is \\boxed{D}.\n\nFinal Answer: D",
        "To calculate the work performed by the muscle fiber, we need to use the fact that the force exerted by the muscle fiber is given by Hooke's law, \\( F = -kx \\), where \\( k \\) is the force constant and \\( x \\) is the displacement.
