        "In the new state, the orange block is on top of the red block, which is not what we intended after unstacking the orange block from the red block. To achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the orange block and the yellow block on top of the red block, we need to modify the plan as follows:\n\n[PLAN]\nunstack the orange block from on top of the red block\nput down the orange block\npick up the red block\nstack the red block on top of the orange block\nunstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block\nput down the blue block\npick up the yellow block\nstack the yellow block on top of the red block\n[PLAN END]\n\nHowever, due to the unexpected event, the current state is not the same as the initial state. After executing step 1 of the plan, the following facts became true: the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, and the orange block is on top of the red block. To continue with the plan, we need to adjust the steps accordingly:\n\n[PLAN]\nunstack the orange block from on top of the red block\nput down the orange block\npick up the red block\nstack the red block on top of the orange block\n[PLAN]\nunstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block\nput down the blue block\npick up the yellow block\nstack the yellow block on top of the red block\n[PLAN END]\n\nNow, we have two separate sub-plans to execute the original plan.
