Then, we can put down the blue block.\n\nAfter that, we can unstack the red block from the orange block and put it down.\n\nNext, we can pick up the yellow block and stack it on top of the blue block.\n\nFinally, we can pick up the red block and stack it on top of the orange block.\n\nHere's the corrected plan:\n\n[PLAN]\nunstack the blue block from on top of the red block\nput down the blue block\nunstack the red block from on top of the orange block\nput down the red block\npick up the yellow block\nstack the yellow block on top of the blue block\npick up the red block\nstack the red block on top of the orange block\n[PLAN END]\n\nThis plan should achieve the desired goal.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)\n",
