So, we only need to move the blue block to the top of the yellow block.\n\nHere's a revised plan:\n\n[PLAN]\npick up the blue block\nstack the blue block on top of the yellow block\n\nThis plan satisfies the goal, as the blue block is now on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is still on top of the red block.\n\nIs this solution correct?\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up blue)\n(stack blue yellow)\n\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up blue)\n(stack blue yellow)\n",
