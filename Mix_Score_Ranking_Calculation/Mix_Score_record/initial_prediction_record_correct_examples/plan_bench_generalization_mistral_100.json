We can do this by following the given plan.\n\nFirst, we pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the green block.\n\nNext, we pick up the silver block and stack it on top of the orange block.\n\nThen, we pick up the magenta block and stack it on top of the silver block.\n\nAfter that, we pick up the red block and stack it on top of the magenta block.\n\nFinally, we pick up the violet block and stack it on top of the red block.\n\nFor the second scenario, the plan is similar. We need to stack the blocks in the desired order, which is magenta on top of blue, and violet on top of magenta.\n\nFirst, we pick up the magenta block and stack it on top of the blue block.\n\nNext, we pick up the violet block and stack it on top of the magenta block.\n\nFinally, we pick up the black block and stack it on top of the violet block.\n\nThis plan follows all the given restrictions and achieves the goal in both scenarios.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta blue)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet magenta)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black violet)\n\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta blue)\n(pick-up violet)\n(stack violet magenta)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black violet)\n",

If the blocks are not accessible or clear initially, additional steps may be required to make them so before executing the plan.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up white)\n(stack white silver)\n(pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta white)\n\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up white)\n(stack white silver)\n(pick-up magenta)\n(stack magenta white)\n",

Then, we stack the silver block on top of the red block, as both our hands and the silver block are clear, and the red block is clear and on the table.\n\nNext, we pick up the black block, ensuring that our hands are empty and the black block is clear and on the table. Afterward, we stack the black block on top of the silver block, as we are holding the black block and the silver block is clear.\n\nBy following this plan, we have successfully stacked the blocks according to the goal conditions.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up silver)\n(stack silver red)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black silver)\n\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up silver)\n(stack silver red)\n(pick-up black)\n(stack black silver)\n"
