        "Navarre used the captivity of John II in 1363 to try to seize power, which was 9 years after the Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny was signed in 1360, where John II's ransom was set. Therefore, Navarre used the captivity of John II 9 years after the Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny.\n\nFinal Answer: 9",
        "The French dispute with Navarre began in 1354, and the leverage of the captivity of John II occurred in 1363 when his son Louis of Anjou, a hostage in English-held Calais, escaped, prompting John II to return to captivity. Therefore, 9 years passed between the French dispute with Navarre and the use of John II's captivity as leverage.\n\nFinal Answer: 9",
        "To determine how many years after John II returned to captivity he died, let's break down the timeline from the given passage:\n\n1. John II was held captive in England.\n2. The Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny set his ransom and allowed for hostages to be held in lieu of John.\n3. John returned to France to try and raise funds to pay the ransom.\n4. In 1362, John's son Louis of Anjou, a hostage in English-held Calais, escaped captivity.\n5. With his stand-in hostage gone, John felt honor-bound to return to captivity in England.\n6. John II died in London while still in honorable captivity in 1364.\n\nJohn returned to captivity in England to try and raise funds for his ransom, and he died in 1364. Since the passage does not explicitly state the exact year he returned, we can infer that he returned to captivity sometime before 1362, when his son Louis escaped.\n\nTherefore, John II died 2 years after he returned to captivity, as he died in 1364, and we can assume he returned sometime in 1362 or before.\n\nFinal Answer: 2",
        "John II's son, Louis of Anjou, escaped captivity in English-held Calais in 1362. John II died in 1364. Therefore, John II died 2 years after his son was taken hostage in English-held Calais. However, it's important to note that the passage states Louis escaped in 1362, which implies he was taken hostage sometime before that year. Assuming the escape was immediate after being taken, it would still be 2 years from 1362 to 1364.\n\nFinal Answer: 2",
        "To determine how many years passed between the French being at odds with Navarre and the Navarrese attempting to seize power, we need to identify the relevant dates from the passage.\n\n1. The French crown had been at odds with Navarre since 1354.\n2. In 1363, the Navarrese used the captivity of John II in London and the political weakness of the Dauphin to try to seize power.\n\nThe period we are interested in is from 1354 to 1363.\n\nTo calculate the number of years:\n\\[ 1363 - 1354 = 9 \\]\n\nSo, 9 years passed between the French being at odds with Navarre and the Navarrese attempting to seize power.\n\nFinal Answer: 9",

        "John II was king first. The passage states that John II was held captive in England and that Charles V succeeded him as king of France. It also mentions that Charles V was crowned as the new king after John II's death in 1364.\n\nFinal Answer: John II",
        "The Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny happened first. The Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny was signed in 1360, setting the terms for the release of King John II of France from captivity in England, including the ransom amount and the holding of hostages. The Battle of Cocherel took place on 7 May 1364, which is mentioned later in the passage and occurred after John II's death in 1364.\n\nFinal Answer: Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny",
        "John II died in London in 1364 while still in captivity, which means he lived for 2 years after returning to captivity in England in 1362.\n\nFinal Answer: 2",

        "To calculate the number of days that passed from when SCDOT announced its preferred routing of I-73 until alternative corridors were formally announced to the public, we need to determine the dates involved:\n\n1. SCDOT announced its preferred routing on May 30, 2006.\n2. Alternative corridors were formally announced on September 7, 2006.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of days between these two dates:\n\n- From May 30 to May 31: 1 day\n- June: 30 days\n- July: 31 days\n- August: 31 days\n- September 1 to September 7: 7 days\n\nAdding these together:\n1 (May 30 to May 31) + 30 (June) + 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 7 (September 1 to September 7) = 100 days\n\nTherefore, 100 days had passed from when SCDOT announced its preferred routing of I-73 between Myrtle Beach and Interstate 95 in South Carolina until alternative corridors were formally announced to the public.\n\nFinal Answer: 100",

        "According to the passage, Frank Gore set a franchise record with 148 yards rushing in the first half. Since his 61-yard touchdown run is included in this total, we need to subtract that from the 148 yards to find out how many yards he had in runs other than his touchdown run.\n\nSo, we calculate:\n\n148 yards (total first half rushing) - 61 yards (touchdown run) = 87 yards\n\nTherefore, Frank Gore had 87 yards in the first half on runs other than his touchdown run.\n\nFinal Answer: 87",
        "According to the passage, Matthew Stafford threw five passing touchdowns in total, with three of them going to Calvin Johnson.
