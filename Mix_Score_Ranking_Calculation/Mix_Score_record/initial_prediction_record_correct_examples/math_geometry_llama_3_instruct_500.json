        "Let's break this problem down step by step!\n\nFirst, we need to find the volume of the original square pyramid. The formula for the volume of a square pyramid is:\n\nV = (1/3) \\* base area \\* altitude\n\nThe base area of the original pyramid is:\n\nbase area = side^2 = 12^2 = 144 cm^2\n\nThe altitude of the original pyramid is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nV = (1/3) \\* 144 \\* 8 = 384 cm^3\n\nNow, let's find the volume of the smaller pyramid. Again, we use the formula:\n\nV = (1/3) \\* base area \\* altitude\n\nThe base area of the smaller pyramid is:\n\nbase area = side^2 = 6^2 = 36 cm^2\n\nThe altitude of the smaller pyramid is 4 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nV = (1/3) \\* 36 \\* 4 = 48 cm^3\n\nNow, we need to find the volume of the frustum. To do this, we subtract the volume of the smaller pyramid from the volume of the original pyramid:\n\nVolume of frustum = Volume of original pyramid - Volume of smaller pyramid\n= 384 cm^3 - 48 cm^3\n= 336 cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the frustum is 336 cubic centimeters.\n\nFinal Answer: 336.0",

        "The volume of a cube is $s^3$ and the surface area is $6s^2$. Since the volume is $5x$ and the surface area is $x$, we have that $s^3=5x$ and $6s^2=x$. We can substitute $x=6s^2$ into $s^3=5x$ to obtain $s^3=5\\cdot6s^2=30s^2$. Since $s^2\\ne0$, we can divide both sides by $s^2$ to obtain $s=30$. Therefore, $x=6s^2=6(30)^2=\\boxed{5400}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5400. I hope it is correct.\n\nFinal Answer: 5400.0",

        "Since the ratio of their areas is 1:4, the ratio of their bases must also be 1:2. This is because the area of a triangle is equal to half the base times the height.\n\nIf the height of the smaller triangle is 3 cm, then the height of the larger triangle must be 3 x 2 = 6 cm.\n\nSo, the corresponding height of the larger triangle is 6 cm.\n\nFinal Answer: 6.0",
