The goal is to have the orange block on top of the red block.\n\nHowever, when attempting to pick up the orange block in the original plan, an unexpected event occurred, and the orange block was picked up from on top of the blue block instead of being clear. This meant that the blue block was no longer clear, and the hand was not holding the orange block.\n\nTo achieve the goal, we need to first unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block and put it down. Then, we can pick up the red block, put it down, and finally pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the red block.
