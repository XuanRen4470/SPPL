Therefore, the truth of the statement is undetermined or irrelevant given the context.\n\nFinal Answer: neutral",
        "The statement \"A team is trying to tag a runner out\" is an entailment given the context.

        "The statement \"A high school is hosting an event\" is a neutral statement given the context. The context does not provide enough information to determine if the statement is entailed (definitely true) or contradictory (definitely false) based on the context alone. The statement is neutral because the truth value of the statement is not determined or irrelevant to the context. The context only mentions that the school is having a special event to show American culture, but it does not specify that the event is not a regular high school event or that it is not an American culture event for other cultures. Therefore, the statement can be true or false depending on the specifics of the event being described, and the context does not provide enough information to definitively determine the truth value of the statement.\n\nFinal Answer: neutral",

        "The statement \"The woman is cold\" is neutral given the context. The truth of the statement cannot be determined for certain based on the information provided in the context. While it is possible that the woman could be cold, there is no definitive way to know for sure based on the given context alone.

Therefore, the truth of the statement is undetermined or irrelevant given the context.\n\nFinal Answer: neutral",
        "The statement \"People biking through the city\" is neutral given the context. The people waiting at a light on bikes are a subset of people biking through the city, so the statement is not a contradiction.
