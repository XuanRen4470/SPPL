        "I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nLet's start by finding the amount of money you earned:\n\nYou worked $t-6$ hours and earned $2t-5$ dollars per hour, so your total earnings are:\n\n$(t-6)(2t-5) = 2t^2 - 17t + 30$\n\nNow, let's find the amount of money Andrew earned:\n\nAndrew worked $2t-8$ hours and earned $t-5$ dollars per hour, so his total earnings are:\n\n$(2t-8)(t-5) = 2t^2 - 18t + 40$\n\nSince you both earned the same amount, we can set up an equation:\n\n$2t^2 - 17t + 30 = 2t^2 - 18t + 40$\n\nNow, let's simplify the equation:\n\n$-17t + 30 = -18t + 40$\n\nAdd $17t$ to both sides:\n\n$30 = -t + 40$\n\nSubtract 40 from both sides:\n\n$-10 = -t$\n\nAdd $t$ to both sides:\n\n$0 = 10$\n\nWait, that's not correct!

        "Let the two positive integers be x and y. We know that the sum of the squares of the two integers is 90, so we can write the equation:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 90\n\nWe also know that the product of the two integers is 27, so we can write the equation:\n\nxy = 27\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously. Let's start by factoring the equation x^2 + y^2 = 90:\n\n(x + y)(x - y) = 90\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the product of the two integers is 27 to rewrite the equation:\n\n(x + y)(x - y) = 90\n(x + y)(x - y) = 3^3\n(x + y) = 3 or (x + y) = -3\n\nSince the integers are positive, we can ignore the solution (x + y) = -3. Therefore, we have:\n\nx + y = 3\n\nNow, we can use the equation xy = 27 to solve for x and y. Since the product of the two integers is 27, we can rewrite the equation:\n\nx = 27/y\n\nSubstituting this expression for x into the equation x + y = 3, we get:\n\n27/y + y = 3\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by y, we get:\n\n27 + y^2 = 3y\n\nSubtracting 27 from both sides of the equation, we get:\n\ny^2 - 3y + 27 = 0\n\nFactoring the left-hand side of the equation, we get:\n\n(y - 3)(y - 9) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible values for y: y = 3 or y = 9. Since the integers are positive, we can ignore the solution y = -9. Therefore, we have:\n\ny = 3 or y = 9\n\nSubstituting these values for y into the equation x = 27/y, we get:\n\nx = 9 or x = 3\n\nNow, we can find the sum of the two integers by adding the values of x and y:\n\nx + y = 9 + 3 = 12\n\nTherefore, the sum of the two integers is 12.\n\nFinal Answer: 12.0",
