The revised plan addresses this goal by:\n\n1. Unstacking the orange block from the yellow block and putting it down.\n2. Unstacking the yellow block from the red block and putting it down.\n3. Unstacking the red block from the blue block and putting it down.\n4. Picking up the orange block and stacking it on top of the red block.\n5.
