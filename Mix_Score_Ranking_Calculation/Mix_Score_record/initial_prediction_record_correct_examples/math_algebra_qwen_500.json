        "To find the value of \\( x \\) that gives the minimum value for the quadratic function \\( f(x) = x^2 - 10x + 24 \\), we can use the vertex formula for a parabola. The vertex form of a quadratic function \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) gives the \\( x \\)-coordinate of the vertex as \\( x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\).\n\nFor the given function \\( f(x) = x^2 - 10x + 24 \\), the coefficients are:\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n- \\( b = -10 \\)\n- \\( c = 24 \\)\n\nUsing the vertex formula:\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{b}{2a} = -\\frac{-10}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( x \\) that gives the minimum value for the function is \\( x = 5 \\).\n\nTo confirm, we can complete the square for the quadratic function. Starting with:\n\\[\nf(x) = x^2 - 10x + 24\n\\]\n\nWe complete the square as follows:\n1. Take the coefficient of \\( x \\), which is \\(-10\\), divide it by 2, and square it:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{-10}{2}\\right)^2 = 25\n\\]\n\n2. Add and subtract this square inside the function:\n\\[\nf(x) = x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 + 24\n\\]\n\n3. Rewrite the expression by grouping the perfect square trinomial:\n\\[\nf(x) = (x - 5)^2 - 1\n\\]\n\nThe function \\( f(x) = (x - 5)^2 - 1 \\) is in vertex form, where the vertex is at \\( (5, -1) \\). The minimum value of \\( (x - 5)^2 \\) is 0, which occurs when \\( x = 5 \\).\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( x \\) that gives the minimum value for \\( x^2 - 10x + 24 \\) is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nFinal Answer: 5.0",

        "To determine the sum of all possible positive integer values of \\( b \\) such that the quadratic equation \\( 2x^2 + 5x + b = 0 \\) has rational roots, we need to use the fact that a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) has rational roots if and only if its discriminant is a perfect square. For the given quadratic equation \\( 2x^2 + 5x + b = 0 \\), the discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 5^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot b = 25 - 8b\n\\]\n\nFor the roots to be rational, \\( 25 - 8b \\) must be a perfect square.

We now calculate the corresponding values of \\( b \\):\n\n- If \\( k^2 = 1 \\), then \\( b = \\frac{25 - 1}{8} = \\frac{24}{8} = 3 \\).\n- If \\( k^2 = 9 \\), then \\( b = \\frac{25 - 9}{8} = \\frac{16}{8} = 2 \\).\n\nThe possible positive integer values of \\( b \\) are 2 and 3.

The equation \\(\\log_{16} (r+16) = \\frac{5}{4}\\) means that \\(16^{\\frac{5}{4}} = r+16\\).\n\nFirst, we simplify \\(16^{\\frac{5}{4}}\\). We know that \\(16\\) can be written as \\(2^4\\), so we have:\n\\[\n16^{\\frac{5}{4}} = (2^4)^{\\frac{5}{4}} = 2^{4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{4}} = 2^5 = 32.\n\\]\nThus, the equation \\(16^{\\frac{5}{4}} = r+16\\) becomes:\n\\[\n32 = r + 16.\n\\]\nTo find \\(r\\), we subtract 16 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\nr = 32 - 16 = 16.\n\\]\nTherefore, the value of \\(r\\) that satisfies the equation is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).\n\nFinal Answer: 16.0",

        "To determine Karen's average speed, we need to calculate the total time she spent driving and then divide the total distance by the total time.\n\nFirst, let's find the total time Karen spent driving. She started at 9:40 a.m. and finished at 1:20 p.m. We can break this down into hours and minutes:\n\n- From 9:40 a.m. to 12:40 p.m. is 3 hours.\n- From 12:40 p.m. to 1:20 p.m. is 40 minutes.\n\nSo, the total time spent driving is 3 hours and 40 minutes. To convert this time into hours, we note that 40 minutes is \\(\\frac{40}{60} = \\frac{2}{3}\\) hours. Therefore, the total time in hours is:\n\\[ 3 + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{9}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{11}{3} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we use the formula for average speed, which is the total distance divided by the total time:\n\\[ \\text{Average speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Total time}} = \\frac{165 \\text{ miles}}{\\frac{11}{3} \\text{ hours}} = 165 \\times \\frac{3}{11} = 15 \\times 3 = 45 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nThus, Karen's average speed is \\(\\boxed{45}\\) miles per hour.\n\nFinal Answer: 45.0",
