        "Let's denote Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income by \\( x \\). According to the problem, she used to spend 40% of her monthly income on rent and utilities. Therefore, the amount she spent on rent and utilities was \\( 0.4x \\).\n\nAfter her salary was increased by $600, her new monthly income is \\( x + 600 \\). Now, the rent and utilities amount to 25% of her new monthly income. Therefore, the amount she spends on rent and utilities is also \\( 0.25(x + 600) \\).\n\nSince the amount spent on rent and utilities did not change, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 0.4x = 0.25(x + 600) \\]\n\nNext, we solve this equation step by step. First, we expand the right side of the equation:\n\\[ 0.4x = 0.25x + 150 \\]\n\nThen, we isolate \\( x \\) by subtracting \\( 0.25x \\) from both sides:\n\\[ 0.4x - 0.25x = 150 \\]\n\\[ 0.15x = 150 \\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 0.15:\n\\[ x = \\frac{150}{0.15} \\]\n\\[ x = 1000 \\]\n\nTherefore, Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was \\(\\boxed{1000}\\).\n\nFinal Answer: 1000.0",
