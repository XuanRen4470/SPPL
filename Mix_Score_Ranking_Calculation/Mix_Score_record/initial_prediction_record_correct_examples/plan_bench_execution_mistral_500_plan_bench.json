        "Based on the given rules and the initial conditions and action sequence provided, the resulting state after executing the given action sequence would be as follows:\n\n[RESULTING STATE]\nThe orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table, and the blue block is in hand.\n\nTherefore, the blue block is no longer on the table. Since the hand is empty at the beginning of the action sequence and the blue block is picked up at the end, the blue block must have been put into the hand during the execution of the action sequence, but since the action sequence does not include the instruction to put down the blue block, it is still being held in the hand.\n\nSo, the final state is: the orange block is clear, the hand is holding the blue block, the red block is on the table, and the orange block is on top of the red block.\n\nFinal Answer: the red block is on the table, the hand is currently holding blue block, the orange block is clear, the orange block is on top of the red block",
        "The blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is currently holding the orange block, the blue block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table, and the yellow block is on the table.\n\nTherefore, the resulting state after the given action sequence is the same as the one provided in the problem statement.\n\nFinal Answer: the red block is on the table, the yellow block is on the table, the blue block is clear, the blue block is on top of the red block, the hand is currently holding orange block, the yellow block is clear"
