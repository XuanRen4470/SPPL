The third present requires the same amount of wrapping paper as the other two presents put together, so it requires 2x square feet.\n\nSince Carrie needs wrapping paper for all three presents, we add up the amounts for each present:\n\nTotal wrapping paper needed = x (for the first present) + (3/4)x (for the second present) + 2x (for the third present)\n\nTo simplify the expression, we can combine the terms with x:\n\nTotal wrapping paper needed = x + x + (3/4)x\n\nNow, we can combine the terms with the same variable:\n\nTotal wrapping paper needed = 3x + (3/4)x\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both x and the denominator by 4:\n\nTotal wrapping paper needed = 3x + 3x * 4/4\n\nTotal wrapping paper needed = 3x + 12x/4\n\nNow, we can simplify the fraction:\n\nTotal wrapping paper needed = 3x + 12x/4\nTotal wrapping paper needed = 3x + 4x\nTotal wrapping paper needed = 7x\n\nSo, Carrie needs 7 square feet of wrapping paper for all three presents.\n\nFinal Answer: 7.0",
        "First, let's find out how many pounds of flour Tommy needs in total to make 12 loaves:\n\n12 loaves * 4 pounds of flour per loaf = 48 pounds of flour\n\nNext, let's determine which bag of flour is more cost-effective for Tommy:\n\nCost of 10-pound bag: $10\nCost of 12-pound bag: $13\n\nTo find out which bag is cheaper per pound, we can divide the cost by the number of pounds in the bag:\n\nCost per pound for 10-pound bag: $10 / 10 pounds = $1/pound\nCost per pound for 12-pound bag: $13 / 12 pounds = $1.0833/pound (approximately)\n\nSince $1/pound is cheaper than $1.0833/pound, Tommy should buy the 10-pound bag.\n\nTo find out how many 10-pound bags he needs, we can divide the total amount of flour he needs by the number of pounds in each bag:\n\n48 pounds of flour / 10 pounds per bag = 4.8 bags\n\nSince he can't buy a fraction of a bag, Tommy needs to buy 5 bags of flour.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the total cost of the flour by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:\n\nTotal cost = 5 bags * $10/bag = $50\n\nSo, Tommy spends $50 on flour.\n\nFinal Answer: 50.0",

        "To calculate the amount of gratuities charged, we first need to determine the pre-tax amount of your bill.\n\nThe cost of the NY Striploin is $80, and the cost of the glass of wine is $10. So the total cost of your meal before taxes is:\n\n$80 (steak) + $10 (wine) = $90\n\nNext, we calculate the sales tax. The tax rate is 10%, so:\n\nSales tax = 0.10 * $90 = $9\n\nNow, we add the sales tax to the pre-tax amount to find the total amount on your bill before gratuities:\n\nTotal amount before gratuities = $90 (pre-tax) + $9 (sales tax) = $99\n\nSince the total bill you were charged was $140, the difference between the total bill and the pre-tax amount is the amount they charged for gratuities:\n\nGratuities = $140 (total bill) - $99 (pre-tax amount) = $41\n\nSo, the restaurant charged you an additional $41 for gratuities without making it clear that it was being added to your bill.\n\nFinal Answer: 41.0",

The original price is $100, and there is a 20% discount.\n\nDiscounted price for the dress = Original price * (1 - Discount percentage)\nDiscounted price for the dress = $100 * (1 - 0.2)\nDiscounted price for the dress = $100 * 0.8\nDiscounted price for the dress = $80\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total amount Daniela spends:\n\nTotal amount spent = Total cost for shoes + Total cost for the dress\nTotal amount spent = $60 + $80\nTotal amount spent = $140\n\nFinal Answer: 140.0",
        "Let's find out how many candies each person can eat before crying and then calculate how many candies they consumed together.\n\nNellie can eat 12 candies before crying.\nJacob can eat half of that, so he can eat 12 / 2 = 6 candies before crying.\nLana can eat 3 fewer candies than Jacob, so she can eat 6 - 3 = 3 candies before crying.\n\nTogether, they consumed candies until they cried, which was for Nellie, Jacob, and Lana. In total, they cried after eating candies.\n\nNow, let's find out how many candies are left in the bucket. We know there were initially 30 candies, and they each consumed candies. So there are candies left in the bucket.\n\nTo divide the remaining candies equally, we simply divide the number of remaining candies by the number of people:\n\ncandies per person = remaining candies / number of people\n\ncandies per person = candies left / 3\n\nSince we don't know the exact number of candies left, we cannot determine the exact number of candies each person will get. However, we do know that they will each get an equal share of the remaining candies.\n\nFinal Answer: 3.0",

        "Let's break down the problem into steps:\n\n1. Lydia planted the tree when she was 4 years old.\n2. It takes 7 years for the tree to bear fruit.\n3. To find out when Lydia can eat an apple from her tree for the first time, we need to determine how old she will be when the tree is 7 years old.\n\nSince 7 years have passed since the tree was planted, and Lydia is currently 9 years old, we can find the answer by adding the number of years the tree took to bear fruit to the year Lydia planted it:\n\nAge when Lydia can eat an apple from her tree = Age when she planted the tree + Number of years it took for the tree to bear fruit\n= 4 years + 7 years\n= 11 years old\n\nSo, Lydia would be 11 years old when she gets to eat an apple from her tree for the first time.\n\nFinal Answer: 11.0",
        "To find out how much the High Jump sneakers cost, we need to determine how much money Joey will earn from each activity and then add them together.\n\n1. Mowing lawns: 3 lawns at $8 each = $24\n2. Selling collectible figures: 2 figures at $9 each = $18\n3. After-school job: 10 hours at $5 per hour = $50\n\nNow, let's add up Joey's earnings: $24 + $18 + $50 = $92\n\nSince we know that Joey's earnings just cover the price of the High Jump sneakers, we can find the cost of the shoes by setting up the equation:\n\n$92 = Price of High Jump sneakers\n\nSo, the price of the High Jump sneakers is $92.\n\nFinal Answer: 92.0",

        "To find the difference in the bookstore's earnings on these two books last week, we first need to calculate the earnings from selling each type of book separately.\n\nEarnings from selling TOP books = Number of TOP books sold * Price of each TOP book\n                                            = 13 * $8\n                                            = $104\n\nEarnings from selling ABC books = Number of ABC books sold * Price of each ABC book\n                                             = 4 * $23\n                                             = $92\n\nNow, we can find the difference in earnings by subtracting the earnings from selling ABC books from the earnings from selling TOP books:\n\nDifference in earnings = Earnings from selling TOP books - Earnings from selling ABC books\n                                 = $104 - $92\n                                 = $12\n\nFinal Answer: 12.0",
        "To find the square footage that the smaller house is being expanded by, subtract the initial total square footage of both houses from the new total square footage, and then find the difference between that number and the initial square footage of the smaller house.\n\nFirst, let's find the initial total square footage of both houses: 5,200 sq. ft. (smaller house) + 7,300 sq. ft. (larger house) = 12,500 sq. ft.\n\nNow, we know that the new total square footage of both houses is 16,000 sq. ft. So, the difference between the new total and the initial total is: 16,000 sq. ft. (new total) - 12,500 sq. ft. (initial total) = 3,500 sq. ft.\n\nTherefore, the smaller house is being expanded by 3,500 sq. ft.\n\nFinal Answer: 3500.0",
