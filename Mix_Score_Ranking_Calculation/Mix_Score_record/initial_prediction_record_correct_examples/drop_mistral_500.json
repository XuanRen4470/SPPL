        "The draft was universal in the United States during World War I because the government wanted to raise military manpower quickly and efficiently, and voluntary enlistment was not meeting the target numbers. The draft included all men within certain age ranges, regardless of race or socio-economic status, in order to ensure a large and diverse pool of recruits. The universal nature of the draft was also intended to promote a sense of national unity and shared sacrifice during a time of war.\n\nFinal Answer: included blacks",
        "The Selective Draft Law Cases held that the World War I draft was constitutional under the power of Congress to levy taxes and raise and regulate armed forces, and that it did not violate the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude. The Court reasoned that the draft was not a form of involuntary servitude because the servicemembers were not being compelled to labor without compensation, but rather were being required to serve in the military for a limited time, with the promise of pay and other benefits.\n\nFinal Answer: constitutionality of the draft act",
        "The gap between the initial target of 1 million volunteers and the number of volunteers who enlisted in the first six weeks of the war was 927,000 (1 million - 73,000).\n\nFinal Answer: 927000",

        "The Selective Draft Law Cases came before Eugene Debs' run for president. The Supreme Court handed down its decision upholding the constitutionality of the draft act on January 7, 1918. Eugene Debs ran for president from his prison cell in 1920.\n\nFinal Answer: Selective Draft Law Cases",
        "Age ranges were increased and exemptions were reduced to reach 24 million registered men during conscription.\n\nFinal Answer: age ranges",
        "Black Americans were drafted in smaller numbers than white Americans during World War I. The passage states that 367,710 black Americans were drafted, compared to 2,442,586 white Americans.\n\nFinal Answer: black",
        "Eugene Debs, the head of the Socialist Party of America, was imprisoned for \"obstructing the recruitment or enlistment service.\" He ran for president in 1920 from his prison cell.\n\nFinal Answer: Eugene Debs",
        "The passage states that 2,442,586 white Americans were drafted, compared to 367,710 black Americans. Therefore, the difference in the number of whites and blacks who were drafted is:\n\n2,442,586 (whites) - 367,710 (blacks) = 2,074,876\n\nSo, 2,074,876 more whites were drafted than blacks.\n\nFinal Answer: 2074876",

        "The Browns needed to score one more touchdown or field goal than the Steelers in order to win the game. However, the passage states that the Steelers scored 21 points and the Browns scored 18, so the Browns needed one more point to win. Therefore, the Browns needed 22 points to win this game.\n\nFinal Answer: 22",

        "The invasion of Russia by small war parties occurred after the burning of Ryazan. The first event listed in the passage is the burning of Ryazan in 1564, while the first mention of small war parties invading Russia is in 1635.\n\nFinal Answer: the burning of Ryazan",
        "The first event mentioned in the passage is the burning of Ryazan in 1564, which predates the Russo-Crimean War that started in 1571. Therefore, the burning of Ryazan happened before the Russo-Crimean War.\n\nFinal Answer: the burning of Ryazan",
        "The first event mentioned is the burning of the city of Ryazan in 1564. This is not directly related to the Russo-Crimean War, which began in 1571. The Russo-Crimean War was a military conflict between Russia and the Crimean Khanate, which lasted from 1571 to 1594 with intermittent periods of peace. Therefore, the second event mentioned, the Russo-Crimean War, occurred after the burning of Ryazan.\n\nFinal Answer: Russo-Crimean War",
        "The Battle of Molodi occurred before the release of 15,000 captives by Nogais. The passage states that the Battle of Molodi took place in 1572 (line 47), while the release of 15,000 captives by Nogais occurred in 1618 (line 116). Therefore, the Battle of Molodi came before the release of captives by Nogais.\n\nFinal Answer: Battle of Molodi",
        "The Battle of Molodi occurred in 1572, and it was a significant military engagement between the Russian forces and the Tatars. The passage does not provide much detail about the battle itself, but it mentions that it took place.\n\nOn the other hand, the release of 15,000 captives by the Nogais happened in 1618 as part of a peace treaty with Moscow. The passage explains that during the Time of Troubles, so many captives were taken that the price of a slave at Kaffa dropped to fifteen or twenty gold pieces. Later, in the peace treaty, the Nogais released 15,000 captives.\n\nTherefore, the Battle of Molodi and the release of 15,000 captives by the Nogais are two distinct events in Russian history. The Battle of Molodi was a military engagement, while the release of captives was a political event.\n\nFinal Answer: release of 15,000 captives by Nogais",
        "The burning of Ryazan occurred in 1564, which predates the Russo-Crimean War that started in 1571. Therefore, the burning of Ryazan came before the start of the Russo-Crimean War.\n\nFinal Answer: the burning of Ryazan",
        "The raid reached Moscow in 1591 and the suburbs of Moscow were burned in 1592. Therefore, one year passed between these two events.\n\nFinal Answer: 1",
        "The burning of Moscow suburbs occurred in the year 1592. The Nogai raids within sight of Moscow took place during the Time of Troubles, but the exact year is not provided in the passage. However, it is mentioned that the price of a slave at Kaffa dropped significantly during this time, suggesting that the raids occurred around 1614. Therefore, the number of years that passed between these two events can be approximated as follows:\n\n1592 (burning of Moscow suburbs) + (approximately) 22 years (estimated duration of the Time of Troubles and the significant drop in slave prices at Kaffa) = 1614 (Nogai raids within sight of Moscow)\n\nThus, approximately 22 years passed from the burning of Moscow suburbs until the Nogai raids within sight of Moscow.\n\nFinal Answer: 22",
        "The Russo-Crimean War started before the Smolensk War. The first mention of the Russo-Crimean War in the given passage is in 1571, while the first mention of the Smolensk War is in 1632.\n\nFinal Answer: Russo-Crimean War",
        "The Smolensk War started before the last deep raid into Muscovy during the Russo-Crimean War. The last deep raid into Muscovy during the Russo-Crimean War occurred in 1633, while the Smolensk War took place between 1632 and 1634. Therefore, the Smolensk War started before the last deep raid during the Russo-Crimean War.\n\nFinal Answer: Smolensk War",
        "The city of Ryazan posad was burned in 1564, while the suburbs of Moscow were burned in 1592. Therefore, Ryazan was burned before the suburbs of Moscow.\n\nFinal Answer: Ryazan",
        "The city of Ryazan was burned in 1564, while the suburbs of Moscow were burned in 1592.\n\nFinal Answer: Suburbs of Moscow",
        "The Russo-Crimean War started before the Smolensk War. The first mention of the Russo-Crimean War in the given passage is in 1571, while the first mention of the Smolensk War is in 1632. Therefore, the Russo-Crimean War began earlier than the Smolensk War.\n\nFinal Answer: Russo-Crimean War",
        "The Smolensk War started before the last deep raid into Muscovy during the Russo-Crimean War. The passage mentions that in 1633, \"This was the last deep raid into Muscovy\" and that in 1637, \"Several raids were led by Nogais and Crimean nobles without permission of Khan,\" which is considered the beginning of the Russo-Crimean War. However, the passage also mentions that in 1632, \"20,000 Tatars raid the south, as troops were shifted north for the Smolensk War.\" Therefore, the Smolensk War started before 1633 but after 1632. Based on the information provided in the passage, it is not clear which year exactly the Smolensk War began, but it is mentioned before the last deep raid into Muscovy during the Russo-Crimean War.\n\nFinal Answer: Smolensk War",
        "The Battle of Molodi occurred 8 years after the burning of Ryazan (1572 - 1564 = 8 years).\n\nFinal Answer: 8",
        "The Republic, surprised by the easy gains in the East, decided to exploit Portugal's weakness in the Americas. In 1621, the Geoctroyeerde Westindische Compagnie (Dutch West India Company) was established to take control of the sugar trade and colonize America. The Dutch West India Company received a large investment in capital, drawing on the enthusiasm of the best financiers and capitalists of the Republic.\n\nHowever, the Dutch West India Company was not as successful as its eastern counterpart. The Dutch invasion began in 1624 with the conquest of Salvador, the then capital of the State of Brazil, but the Dutch conquest was short-lived. In 1625, a joint Spanish-Portuguese fleet recaptured Salvador.\n\nThe Dutch returned in 1630 and captured Olinda and Recife, renaming it Mauritsstadt and establishing the colony of New Holland. The Portuguese commander, Matias de Albuquerque, retreated his forces inland, and the Dutch were unable to harvest sugar due to Portuguese guerrilla attacks until 1635. The Dutch eventually evicted the Portuguese with the assistance of a local landlord named Domingos Fernandes Calabar, but Calabar was later captured and executed by the Portuguese for treason.\n\nThe Portuguese fought back two Dutch attacks on Bahia in 1638. Nonetheless, by 1641, the Dutch had captured S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, leaving them in control of northwestern Brazil between Maranh\u00e3o and Sergipe in the south.\n\nOverall, the Republic reacted to the quick, simple additions in the East by expanding its territorial holdings in the Americas through the establishment of the Dutch West India Company and military conquests. However, the Dutch were not as successful as they had hoped due to Portuguese resistance and guerrilla attacks.\n\nFinal Answer: Surprised",
        "The Portuguese fought back two Dutch attacks on Bahia in 1638, and the Dutch took control of Brazil between Maranh\u00e3o and Sergipe in the south in 1641. Therefore, there is a difference of 3 years between these two events.\n\nFinal Answer: 3",
        "The Dutch were unable to harvest sugar due to Portuguese guerrilla attacks until 1635.\n\nFinal Answer: 5",
