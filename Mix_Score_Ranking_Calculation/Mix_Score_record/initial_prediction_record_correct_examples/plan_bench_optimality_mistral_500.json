        "[PLAN]\npick up the orange block (1 minute)\nstack the orange block on top of the red block (1 minute)\n[PLAN END]\n\nThe total time to execute the plan is 2 minutes. However, please note that according to the initial conditions, the orange block is already on top of the red block. So, there seems to be a misunderstanding or inconsistency in the problem statement and the goal. If the goal is to keep the current arrangement (orange on red), then no action is needed and the time taken is 0 minutes. If the goal is to change the arrangement, then the current plan would indeed take 2 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up orange)\n(stack orange red)\n",
        "[PLAN]\npick up the yellow block\nstack the yellow block on top of the blue block\n[PLAN END]\n\nThe total time to execute the plan is 2 minutes.\n\nExplanation:\nSince the yellow block is clear and the hand is empty, you can directly pick up the yellow block and stack it on top of the blue block to achieve your goal. This takes only 1 minute for picking up the block and 1 minute for stacking it, resulting in a total time of 2 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: (pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)\n",
