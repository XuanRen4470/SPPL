The truncated cone has a top radius of 2 and a bottom radius of 18. The sphere is tangent to the top and bottom bases and the lateral surface of the truncated cone. This means the distance from the center of the sphere to the top base is \\( r \\) and to the bottom base is \\( r \\). Therefore, the height of the truncated cone is \\( 2r \\).\n\nWe can use similar triangles to find the relationship between the height and the radii of the truncated cone.

        "To solve the problem, we start by considering a regular tetrahedron with side length \\(a\\). The centers of the faces of this tetrahedron form a smaller tetrahedron. We need to find the ratio of the volume of the smaller tetrahedron to the volume of the larger tetrahedron.\n\nFirst, we determine the side length of the smaller tetrahedron. The centroid (center) of a face of the larger tetrahedron is located at a distance of \\(\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\) from each vertex of that face. The distance between the centroids of two adjacent faces is the side length of the smaller tetrahedron. This distance can be calculated as follows:\n\nConsider two adjacent faces of the larger tetrahedron. The line segment connecting the centroids of these two faces is parallel to the edge connecting the opposite vertices of the larger tetrahedron. The distance from the centroid of a face to the opposite vertex is \\(\\frac{a\\sqrt{6}}{3}\\). The distance between the centroids of two adjacent faces is the distance from one centroid to the midpoint of the line segment connecting the opposite vertices, which is \\(\\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\).\n\nThus, the side length of the smaller tetrahedron is \\(\\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\).\n\nNext, we calculate the volume ratio of the smaller tetrahedron to the larger tetrahedron. The volume \\(V\\) of a regular tetrahedron with side length \\(s\\) is given by:\n\\[ V = \\frac{s^3 \\sqrt{2}}{12} \\]\n\nFor the larger tetrahedron with side length \\(a\\), the volume is:\n\\[ V_{\\text{large}} = \\frac{a^3 \\sqrt{2}}{12} \\]\n\nFor the smaller tetrahedron with side length \\(\\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\), the volume is:\n\\[ V_{\\text{small}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\right)^3 \\sqrt{2}}{12} = \\frac{\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}a^3}{27} \\sqrt{2}}{12} = \\frac{4a^3}{324} = \\frac{a^3}{81} \\]\n\nThe ratio of the volume of the smaller tetrahedron to the volume of the larger tetrahedron is:\n\\[ \\frac{V_{\\text{small}}}{V_{\\text{large}}} = \\frac{\\frac{a^3}{81}}{\\frac{a^3 \\sqrt{2}}{12}} = \\frac{12}{81 \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{4}{27 \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{4 \\sqrt{2}}{54} = \\frac{2 \\sqrt{2}}{27} \\]\n\nHowever, we need to simplify this to a rational ratio.

Therefore, rotating 480 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating \\(480 \\mod 360 = 120\\) degrees clockwise. This is because 480 degrees is exactly one full rotation plus an additional 120 degrees.\n\nInitially, ray \\(CA\\) is along the direction of angle 0 degrees (or 360 degrees). After rotating 120 degrees clockwise, ray \\(CA\\) will be in the direction of \\(360 - 120 = 240\\) degrees.\n\nNow, we need to find the measure of the new acute angle \\(ACB\\). The original angle \\(ACB\\) is 40 degrees, and since ray \\(CA\\) is now at 240 degrees, we need to find the angle between 240 degrees and 0 degrees (or 360 degrees).\n\nThe angle between 240 degrees and 0 degrees is \\(360 - 240 = 120\\) degrees. However, we are asked for the acute angle, which is the smaller angle formed by the two rays. The acute angle is \\(360 - 120 = 120 - 40 = 80 - 40 = 40\\) degrees, but we need to consider the smaller angle, which is \\(360 - 120 = 240 - 360 + 40 = 40\\) degrees.\n\nThus, the positive measure of the new acute angle \\(ACB\\) is \\(\\boxed{80}\\).\n\nFinal Answer: 80.0",

Each small circle has a radius of 3 units, and they are tangent to each other and to the large circle.\n\nFirst, let's consider the centers of the small circles. The centers of the small circles form a regular hexagon because each small circle is tangent to its two neighboring small circles. The distance between the centers of any two adjacent small circles is equal to the sum of their radii, which is \\(3 + 3 = 6\\) units.\n\nThe distance from the center of the large circle to the center of any small circle is the radius of the large circle minus the radius of a small circle. Let's denote the radius of the large circle by \\(R\\). Therefore, the distance from the center of the large circle to the center of any small circle is \\(R - 3\\).\n\nIn a regular hexagon, the distance between the center of the hexagon and any of its vertices is equal to the side length of the hexagon. Here, the side length of the hexagon is 6 units, and the distance from the center of the large circle to the center of any small circle is also the radius of the circumscribed circle of this hexagon, which is 6 units.

A diagonal is a line segment that connects two vertices that are not adjacent (i.e., not connected by an edge).\n\n### Step 1: Count the Total Number of Line Segments\nFirst, we calculate the total number of line segments that can be formed by connecting any two vertices of the cube. This is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{8}{2} \\), which represents the number of ways to choose 2 vertices out of 8:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Subtract the Number of Edges\nNext, we subtract the number of edges from the total number of line segments to find the number of diagonals. The cube has 12 edges:\n\n\\[\n28 - 12 = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Types of Diagonals\nTo ensure our count is correct, we can break down the diagonals into two categories:\n1. **Face diagonals**: These are diagonals that lie on the faces of the cube but do not connect adjacent vertices on the same face.\n2. **Space diagonals**: These are diagonals that connect vertices that are not on the same face.\n\n#### Face Diagonals\nEach face of the cube is a square, and a square has 2 diagonals.

The point \\( Q \\) is on the larger circle and the point \\( R \\) is on the smaller circle, and both are on the x-axis.

        "To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given ellipse and the properties of the inscribed equilateral triangle. The equation of the ellipse is \\(x^2 + 4y^2 = 4\\), which can be rewritten as \\(\\frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1\\). This is an ellipse centered at the origin with semi-major axis 2 along the x-axis and semi-minor axis 1 along the y-axis.\n\nGiven that one vertex of the equilateral triangle is at \\((0,1)\\) and one altitude is along the y-axis, the other two vertices must be symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Let's denote the other two vertices as \\((a, b)\\) and \\((-a, b)\\). Since the triangle is equilateral, the distance from \\((0,1)\\) to \\((a, b)\\) is the same as the distance from \\((a, b)\\) to \\((-a, b)\\), and the distance from \\((a, b)\\) to \\((-a, b)\\) is the side length of the equilateral triangle.\n\nFirst, we calculate the distance from \\((0,1)\\) to \\((a, b)\\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{a^2 + (b-1)^2}\n\\]\nThe distance between \\((a, b)\\) and \\((-a, b)\\) is:\n\\[\n2a\n\\]\nSince the triangle is equilateral, these distances are equal:\n\\[\n2a = \\sqrt{a^2 + (b-1)^2}\n\\]\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\\[\n4a^2 = a^2 + (b-1)^2 \\implies 3a^2 = (b-1)^2 \\implies b-1 = \\pm a\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\nSince \\((a, b)\\) lies on the ellipse, it must satisfy the equation \\(\\frac{a^2}{4} + b^2 = 1\\). We substitute \\(b = 1 + a\\sqrt{3}\\) into the ellipse equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{a^2}{4} + (1 + a\\sqrt{3})^2 = 1 \\implies \\frac{a^2}{4} + 1 + 2a\\sqrt{3} + 3a^2 = 1 \\implies \\frac{a^2}{4} + 3a^2 + 2a\\sqrt{3} = 0 \\implies \\frac{13a^2}{4} + 2a\\sqrt{3} = 0\n\\]\nFactoring out \\(a\\), we get:\n\\[\na \\left( \\frac{13a}{4} + 2\\sqrt{3} \\right) = 0\n\\]\nSince \\(a \\neq 0\\), we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{13a}{4} + 2\\sqrt{3} = 0 \\implies 13a = -8\\sqrt{3} \\implies a = -\\frac{8\\sqrt{3}}{13}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(a = -\\frac{8\\sqrt{3}}{13}\\) back into \\(b = 1 + a\\sqrt{3}\\), we get:\n\\[\nb = 1 + \\left( -\\frac{8\\sqrt{3}}{13} \\right) \\sqrt{3} = 1 - \\frac{24}{13} = -\\frac{11}{13}\n\\]\nThus, the coordinates of the other two vertices are \\(\\left( -\\frac{8\\sqrt{3}}{13}, -\\frac{11}{13} \\right)\\) and \\(\\left( \\frac{8\\sqrt{3}}{13}, -\\frac{11}{13} \\right)\\).

The triangle inequality theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Let's denote the third side by \\( x \\).\n\nThe triangle inequality theorem gives us the following conditions:\n1. \\( 33 + 42 > x \\)\n2. \\( 33 + x > 42 \\)\n3. \\( 42 + x > 33 \\)\n\nWe can simplify these inequalities:\n1. \\( 75 > x \\) or \\( x < 75 \\)\n2. \\( 33 + x > 42 \\) or \\( x > 9 \\)\n3. \\( 42 + x > 33 \\) or \\( x > -9 \\) (This inequality is always true since \\( x \\) is a positive integer)\n\nCombining the first two inequalities, we get:\n\\[ 9 < x < 75 \\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) must be an integer, the smallest possible value for \\( x \\) is 10.

When the dimensions of a triangle are tripled, the new triangle is similar to the original triangle with a scale factor of 3. The area of similar triangles is proportional to the square of the scale factor.\n\nLet's denote the area of the original triangle as \\( A \\). Since the dimensions of the triangle are tripled, the scale factor for the sides is 3. Therefore, the area of the new triangle is \\( 3^2 \\) times the area of the original triangle. This can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of the new triangle} = 3^2 \\times \\text{Area of the original triangle} = 9 \\times A\n\\]\nWe know that the area of the new triangle is 54 square feet.

A triangle is obtuse if the square of the length of one side is greater than the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nFirst, we need to ensure that the sides form a valid triangle, which means they must satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. The triangle inequality theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Therefore, we have the following inequalities:\n1. \\( 11 + 15 > k \\)\n2. \\( 11 + k > 15 \\)\n3. \\( 15 + k > 11 \\)\n\nSimplifying these inequalities, we get:\n1. \\( 26 > k \\) or \\( k < 26 \\)\n2. \\( k > 4 \\)\n3. \\( k > -4 \\) (which is always true since \\( k \\) is a positive integer)\n\nCombining the valid inequalities, we get:\n\\[ 4 < k < 26 \\]\nThus, \\( k \\) can be any integer from 5 to 25, inclusive.

Then the area of triangle \\(ABC\\) is:\n\\[\n27 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times h \\implies 27 = 3h \\implies h = 9\n\\]\nSo, the height from \\(B\\) to \\(AC\\) is 9 units.\n\nNow, we need to find the area of triangle \\(BCD\\). The base \\(CD\\) of triangle \\(BCD\\) is 26 units, and the height from \\(B\\) to \\(CD\\) is the same as the height from \\(B\\) to \\(AC\\), which is 9 units.

Since triangle \\(ABD\\) has a right angle at \\(A\\) and \\(AD = 12\\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the coordinates of point \\(D\\). The coordinates of \\(D\\) will be \\((x, 12)\\) for some \\(x\\), and since \\(AD = 12\\), we have:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + (12 - 3)^2 = 12^2 \\implies x^2 + 9^2 = 12^2 \\implies x^2 + 81 = 144 \\implies x^2 = 63 \\implies x = \\sqrt{63} = 3\\sqrt{7}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coordinates of \\(D\\) are \\((3\\sqrt{7}, 12)\\).\n\nNext, we need to find the coordinates of point \\(E\\).

The centroid divides each median into segments in the ratio 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, if \\(DP = 18\\), then \\(DG = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 18 = 12\\) and \\(GP = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 18 = 6\\).

        "To find the length of the shortest line segment \\(\\overline{PQ}\\) that is tangent to both circles \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\), we start by identifying the centers and radii of the circles. The circle \\(C_1\\) is given by \\((x-10)^2 + y^2 = 36\\), so its center is \\((10, 0)\\) and its radius is \\(6\\). The circle \\(C_2\\) is given by \\((x+15)^2 + y^2 = 81\\), so its center is \\((-15, 0)\\) and its radius is \\(9\\).\n\nThe distance between the centers of the circles is the distance between \\((10, 0)\\) and \\((-15, 0)\\), which is:\n\\[\n10 - (-15) = 25.\n\\]\nThe shortest line segment \\(\\overline{PQ}\\) that is tangent to both circles is the common external tangent.
