        "Let's start by figuring out how many purple flowers there are. Since there are 10 yellow flowers and 80% more purple flowers, there are 10 * 1.8 = 18 purple flowers. Then, the total number of yellow and purple flowers is 10 + 18 = 28. The number of green flowers is 25% of the number of yellow and purple flowers, so it is 28 * 0.25 = 7. The total number of flowers is 10 + 18 + 7 = 35. The answer is 35.\n\nFinal Answer: 35.0",

        "What a predicament Jack is in!\n\nLet's help Jack calculate the amount of salt he'll get. Since the seawater is 20% salt, that means 20% of the 2 liters of seawater is salt.\n\nTo find the amount of salt, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 20% = 0.20\n\nNow, multiply the total amount of seawater (2 liters) by the decimal percentage of salt (0.20):\n\n2 liters x 0.20 = 0.4 liters\n\nSince there are 1000 milliliters (mL) in 1 liter, we can multiply the amount of salt (0.4 liters) by 1000 to get the amount of salt in milliliters:\n\n0.4 liters x 1000 mL/liter = 400 mL\n\nSo, when all the water evaporates, Jack will be left with 400 mL of salt!\n\nFinal Answer: 400.0",

To find the number of people who won't show up, you can calculate 5% of 220:\n\n5% of 220 = 0.05 x 220 = 11\n\nSo, approximately 11 people might not show up. To find the number of people who will actually attend the wedding, you can subtract 11 from the original number of expected attendees:\n\n220 - 11 = 209\n\nTherefore, Laura can expect around 209 people to attend her wedding.\n\nFinal Answer: 209.0",
        "Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the company paved 4 miles on the first day. This means they used 3 truckloads * 4 miles = 12 truckloads of asphalt. Each truckload uses 5 times as many bags of gravel as it does barrels of pitch. So each truckload uses 2 bags of gravel and 2/5 bags of pitch (5 times as many bags of gravel as it does barrels of pitch). Each truckload uses 2 + 2/5 = 2 2/5 bags of gravel and pitch. So 12 truckloads of asphalt uses 12 * (2 2/5) = 28 bags of gravel and pitch.\n\nThe second day, they paved one mile less than double the first day. So they paved 2 * 4 - 1 = 7 miles. This means they used 3 truckloads * 7 miles = 21 truckloads of asphalt. Each truckload uses 2 bags of gravel and 2/5 bags of pitch. So 21 truckloads of asphalt uses 21 * (2 2/5) = 42 bags of gravel and pitch.\n\nIn total, they used 28 + 42 = 70 bags of gravel and pitch. Each bag of gravel and pitch contains 2/5 bags of pitch. So the total amount of pitch is 70 * (2/5) = 28 bags of pitch.\n\nThe road is 16 miles long, and they paved 4 + 7 = 11 miles so far. So they have 16 - 11 = 5 miles left to pave. They need 3 truckloads of asphalt to pave each mile of road. So they need 3 truckloads * 5 miles = 15 truckloads of asphalt. Each truckload uses 2/5 bags of pitch. So they need 15 * (2/5) = 6 bags of pitch.\n\nThe answer is 6.\n\nFinal Answer: 6.0",

To find the amount deducted as taxes, we can calculate 10% of $40:\n\n10% of $40 = 0.10 x $40 = $4\n\nSo, Adam's daily taxes are $4.\n\nSince Adam works for 30 days, his total earnings would be:\n\n$40 (daily earnings) x 30 (days) = $1200\n\nHowever, we need to subtract the taxes from his total earnings. To do this, we can multiply the daily taxes by the number of days:\n\n$4 (daily taxes) x 30 (days) = $120\n\nNow, let's subtract the taxes from Adam's total earnings:\n\n$1200 (total earnings) - $120 (total taxes) = $1080\n\nSo, after 30 days of work, Adam will have earned $1080 after taxes.\n\nFinal Answer: 1080",

Since there's 40% off, that means the shoes will be discounted by 40% of their original price.\n\n40% of $50 is 0.40 x $50 = $20\n\nSo, the discount on each pair of shoes is $20. Since Daniela buys 2 pairs, the total discount on shoes is $20 x 2 = $40.\n\nThe original price of the shoes is $50 x 2 = $100. With the discount, the price of the shoes becomes $100 - $40 = $60.\n\nNext, let's calculate the discount on the dress. Since there's 20% off, that means the dress will be discounted by 20% of its original price.\n\n20% of $100 is 0.20 x $100 = $20\n\nSo, the discount on the dress is $20.\n\nThe original price of the dress is $100.

She sells each book for $20 and spends $5 to make each book, so her revenue is $20 x (number of books sold) and her cost is $5 x (number of books sold). The profit is the difference between the two:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n$120 = ($20 x (number of books sold)) - ($5 x (number of books sold))\n\n2. To find the number of books sold, we can simplify the equation by combining like terms:\n\n$120 = $15 x (number of books sold)\n\n3. To find the number of books sold, we can divide both sides of the equation by $15:\n\n(number of books sold) = $120 / $15\n(number of books sold) = 8\n\nSo, Tina sold 8 books.\n\n4.

Since James owns 40 dollars more than Ali, James owns x + 40 dollars.\n\nWe know that James and Ali together own 250 dollars, so we can set up the equation:\n\nx + (x + 40) = 250\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2x + 40 = 250\n\nSubtract 40 from both sides:\n\n2x = 210\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx = 105\n\nSo Ali owns 105 dollars. Since James owns 40 dollars more than Ali, James owns:\n\n105 + 40 = 145\n\nJames owns 145 dollars.\n\nFinal Answer: 145.0",
        "Joey is planning to earn money to buy the shoes. He will earn 3 x 8 = 24 dollars by mowing lawns, 2 x 9 = 18 dollars by selling collectible figures, and 10 x 5 = 50 dollars by working. His total earnings are 24 + 18 + 50 = 92 dollars. This is equal to the price of the shoes. The answer is 92.\n\nFinal Answer: 92.0",
        "I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n* Mom: $12\n* Dad: $12\n* Grandma: $12\n* Three little sisters: 3 x $10 = $30\n\nTotal cost for tickets: $12 + $12 + $12 + $30 = $66\n\nSo, the total cost for the family's tickets will be $66.\n\nFinal Answer: 66.0",
        "Andy started at 156 pounds. He gained 36 pounds, so he is now 156 + 36 = 192 pounds. Andy lost 1/8 of his weight every month for 3 months. 1/8 is the same as 0.125. So he lost 0.125 x 3 = 0.375 of his weight. 0.375 of 192 is 0.375 x 192 = 72. So Andy lost 72 pounds. 192 - 72 = 120. So Andy weighs 120 pounds now. He weighs 156 - 120 = 36 pounds less than he did at the beginning of the year. The answer is 36.\n\nFinal Answer: 36.0",
        "Lance works 35 hours a week. He earns $9 an hour. To find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply the number of hours he works by his hourly wage. 35 hours * $9 an hour = $315 a week.\n\nHe works 5 days a week. To find out how much he makes each day, we divide his weekly earnings by the number of days he works. $315 a week / 5 days a week = $63 a day. The answer is $63.\n\nFinal Answer: 63.0",
        "I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nThe perimeter of a triangle is the sum of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 160 cm, and two of the sides are 40 cm and 50 cm. To find the length of the third side, we can set up an equation:\n\n40 + 50 + x = 160\n\nWhere x is the length of the third side.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n90 + x = 160\n\nSubtract 90 from both sides:\n\nx = 70\n\nSo, the length of the third side is 70 cm.\n\nFinal Answer: 70.0",
        "There are 40 judges in total. 10% are under 30, so 4 are under 30. 60% are between 30 and 50, so 24 are between 30 and 50. That leaves 40 - 4 - 24 = 12 judges over 50. The answer is 12.\n\nFinal Answer: 12.0",
        "The total money collected was 50 x 100 = 5000. The total expenses were 5000 - 500 = 4500. The answer is 4500.\n\nFinal Answer: 4500.0",
        "Let's start by finding the total number of pretzels, goldfish, and suckers. We know that there are 64 pretzels. Since there are four times as many goldfish, that means there are 4 x 64 = 256 goldfish. And there are 32 suckers. In total, that's 64 + 256 + 32 = 352 items.\n\nNow we need to divide those items among the 16 kids in the class. To do that, we can divide the total number of items by the number of kids: 352 \u00f7 16 = 22.\n\nSo each baggie will have 22 items.\n\nFinal Answer: 22.0",
        "Michael uses 10 matchsticks for each house. Since he made 30 houses, he used 30 x 10 = 300 matchsticks. Since he only used half of his original pile, he must have had 2 x 300 = 600 matchsticks originally. The answer is 600.\n\nFinal Answer: 600.0",
        "Let's break it down step by step!\n\nSalvadore earned $1956.\n\nSanto earned half of what Salvadore earned, so Santo earned:\n\n$1956 \u00f7 2 = $978\n\nNow, let's add the amount earned by both men:\n\nSalvadore's earnings: $1956\nSanto's earnings: $978\nTotal earnings: $1956 + $978 = $2934\n\nSo, the two men earned a total of $2934 together!\n\nFinal Answer: 2934.0"
